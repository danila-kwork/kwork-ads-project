He", "full_desc": "\n\nDavid Robert Joseph Beckham OBE (UK: /\u02c8b\u025bk\u0259m/;[6] born 2 May 1975) is an English former professional footballer, the current president and co-owner of Inter Miami CF and co-owner of Salford City.[7] Known for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham has frequently been hailed as one of the greatest and most recognisable midfielders of his generation, as well as one of the best set-piece specialists of all time.[8][9] He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. Due to his talent and achievements for both club and country, Beckham is additionally lauded as one of the greatest Manchester United footballers of all time[10][11][12] as well as one of the best English players in the history of the sport.[13][14][15]\n\nBeckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17.[16] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.[16] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[17] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[18] In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[19] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with AC Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.[16] He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.[20][21]\n\nIn international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[22][23] He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004. He held the England appearance record for an outfield player until 2016.\n\nA global ambassador of football, Beckham is considered to be a British cultural icon.[24][25] He was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or in 1999, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year (1999 and 2001) and in 2004 was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[26][27][28] He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021.[29] He has been a UNICEF UK ambassador since 2005, and in 2015 he launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund.[30]\n\nBeckham has consistently ranked among the highest earners in football, and in 2013 was listed as the highest-paid player in the world, having earned over $50\u00a0million in the previous 12 months.[31] He has been married to Victoria Beckham since 1999 and they have four children.[32] In 2014, MLS announced that Beckham and a group of investors would own Inter Miami CF, which began play in 2020.[33]\n\nBeckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England.[34] He is the son of Sandra Georgina (n\u00e9e West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan \"Ted\" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, 1948), a kitchen fitter; the couple married in 1969 in the London Borough of Hackney.[35] He was given the middle name Robert in honour of Bobby Charlton, his father's favourite footballer.[36] He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He attended Chingford County High School in Nevin Drive, Chingford.[37] In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, \"At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do.\"[38] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish,[39] and Beckham has referred to himself as \"half Jewish\"[40] and wrote in his autobiography \"I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion\".[41] In his book Both Feet on the Ground, Beckham stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.[42]\n\nHis parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who frequently travelled 200 miles (320\u00a0km) to Old Trafford from London to attend the team's home matches.[43] David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton's Soccer Schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition.[44] He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers, which was coached by his father, Stuart Underwood, and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City and attended Tottenham Hotspur's school of excellence, though never represented the club in a match. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.[45] He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.[46] Beckham was a late developer and not selected to represent the England Schoolboys team primarily on account of his small size.[47]\n\nHaving signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[48] Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3\u20131 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3\u20132 in favour of Manchester United and 6\u20133 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.[48]\n\nManchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2\u20130 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2\u20131 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4\u20131 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4\u20130 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.[49]\n\nBeckham then went to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994\u201395 season to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a corner kick.[50]\n\nBeckham returned to Manchester and made his Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995 in a goalless draw against Leeds United. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind Blackburn Rovers, missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the FA Cup final with Everton on 20 May, which United lost 1\u20130, leaving the club without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.[51]\n\nUnited manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\"), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994\u201395 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3\u20131 defeat at Aston Villa,[52] with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game. However, United recovered from this early-season defeat and the young players performed well.[53]\n\nBeckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and FA Cup double that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Chelsea and also providing the corner from which Eric Cantona scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled the Tynesiders at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before Euro 1996.[54]\n\n\"It changed my life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it all went quiet. Then the ball went in and it just erupted. I was on cloud nine.\"\n\n\u2014Beckham on the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name.[55] It was ranked number 18 on Channel 4's poll of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[56]\n\nAt the beginning of the 1996\u201397 season, Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon. With United leading 2\u20130, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line \u2013 57 yards out \u2013 that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.[57]\n\nHis goal celebration saw him raise his arms and walk away smiling rather than run as he often would.[58] In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[56] In a 2016 Sky Sports poll it was ranked the best opening day goal in Premier League history.[58] During the 1996\u201397 season, Beckham became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United, helping them to retain the Premier League title, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers.[59] Prior to the 1997\u201398 season, Beckham inherited the number 7 shirt, a number previously worn by such United greats as George Best and Eric Cantona.[60] Manchester United started the season well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind Arsenal.[61] Beckham had the most assists in the league with 13, while his nine Premier League goals included a free kick from the edge of the 18-yard box against Manchester United's arch rivals Liverpool at Anfield.[62]\n\nIn the 1998\u201399 season, he was part of the United team that won the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League, a unique feat in English football.[63] There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.[64]\n\nTo ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be beaten to prevent their local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title, but Tottenham took an early lead in the match.[63] Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 12 yards out, after receiving the ball on the right side of the penalty area, placing the ball into the top left corner of the goal; United went on to win the match 2\u20131 and the league.[63][65]\n\nBeckham played in central midfield in United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, as United's first-choice centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were suspended for the match.[63] United were losing the match 1\u20130 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.[63] Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[66]\n\nDespite Beckham's achievements in the 1998\u201399 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,[67] but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999\u20132000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999\u20132000 by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.[68]\n\nBy the early-2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis, but Ferguson was furious when Victoria Beckham was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages \u2013 then \u00a350,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been \"fair to his teammates\"[69] Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.\n\n\"He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing \u2013 from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part.\"' \u2013 Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.[70]\n\nHe was a key player in United's third successive league title in 2000\u201301, only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine Premier League goals, and had the most assists in the league with 12.[71]\n\nOn 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, breaking the second metatarsal bone in his left foot.[72] There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine Aldo Duscher, and England and Argentina were due to meet in that year's World Cup.[73] The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time.[74] Despite the season being curtailed with injury, 2001\u201302 was one of Beckham's best seasons as a United player; he scored 16 goals in all competitions, the best of his career.[75]\n\nFollowing an injury early in the 2002\u201303 season, Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw or kicked a boot that struck Beckham over the eye, causing a cut that required stitches.[76][77][78][79] The incident led to a great deal of transfer speculation involving Beckham, with bookmakers offering odds on whether he or Ferguson would be first to leave the club.[80] Although the team had started the season badly, their results improved greatly from December onwards and they won the league, with Beckham managing a total of 11 goals. He was still a first-choice player for England, however, and in the Queen's Birthday Honours List he was appointed an OBE for services to football on 13 June 2003.[50]\n\nBeckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals.[75] He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years.[57] By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined them at the same time as Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes).\n\n\"He is a great player who is going to become part of the club's great history. He is a man of our times and a symbol of modern-day stardom and what is certain is Real Madrid have signed Beckham because he's a great footballer and a very dedicated professional. His team spirit is unsurpassed and he is one of the best English players of all-time and if only because of that he is with us.\"\n\n\u2014Real Madrid President Florentino P\u00e9rez during Beckham's unveiling.[81]\n\nAs the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona[82] and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[83] but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for \u20ac37\u00a0million on a four-year contract.[84] Beckham was the latest signing in the Gal\u00e1cticos era of global stars signed by club president Florentino P\u00e9rez every summer.[85] The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.[86] Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club, after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[87] Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain Ra\u00fal. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.[88] On sales of Beckham-related merchandise following his arrival at Real an Adidas spokesman stated, \"Put Beckham's name on any product and Real Madrid didn't stop selling\".[89]\n\nIn the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late-July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Comparing his reception upon arriving at Kunming Airport in south China to Beatlemania, Marca ran the headline, \"Beckham-mania in China\".[89] After the opening game in Beijing the tour featured games in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangkok. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues.[89]\n\nShortly after his transfer to Real, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe, who had guided him through his career until that point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with Simon Fuller and his company 19 Entertainment, which already managed the career of Victoria.[90] Beckham also appointed close friend Terry Byrne to be his personal manager.[91][92]\n\n\"We knew before he was a good player, but we did not expect him to be such an influential player, to show such commitment to the team spirit. The way he runs for everything, the way he tries his best. He has everyone's respect.\"\n\n\u2014Ronaldo speaking about Beckham in October 2003.[93]\n\nIn late-August 2003, Real Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus RCD Mallorca, with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3\u20130 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Lu\u00eds Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Ra\u00fal and Iker Casillas, Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5\u20133\u20132 formation, with two fullbacks M\u00edchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos, often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Figo.[94]\n\nReal Madrid were runners-up in the Copa del Rey, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president P\u00e9rez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.[95]\n\nThe league season began with new head coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next caution, and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had \"made a mistake\" and apologised.[96] He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.\n\nBy Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second position in the league, Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n was dismissed, and Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe CF. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro. By the end of that season, Beckham was third in La Liga in number of assists.[97]\n\nDuring the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.[98] Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005\u201306 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as P\u00e9rez resigned his post as president in January 2006, with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of the season.\n\nThe summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as the club's presidential elections were held. Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under the previous president was kept, including head coach L\u00f3pez Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.[99]\n\nOn 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for the LA Galaxy beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he continued to train with the team.[100] A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calder\u00f3n said that Beckham is \"going to Hollywood to be half a film star\", adding \"our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles\".[101]\n\nAbout a month later, however, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2\u20131 victory.[102] In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn describing his performance as \"world class\".[103]\n\nOn 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3\u20131 win over Mallorca which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0\u20131, Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading the team to that season's La Liga title, their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall in the club's history. Although Real and Bar\u00e7elona both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of their superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.[104] With his wife and children, along with celebrity friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, watching from a luxury box at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium, it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.[104]\n\nTowards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.[105] Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival in the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.[106]\n\nA month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, Forbes magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600\u00a0million during Beckham's four years at the club.[107]\n\nI'm coming there not to be a superstar. I'm coming there to be part of the team, to work hard and to hopefully win things. With me, it's about football. I'm coming there to make a difference. I'm coming there to play football\u00a0... I'm not saying me coming over to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America. That would be difficult to achieve. Baseball, basketball, American football, they've been around. But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could make a difference.[108]\n\nBeckham on going to America\n\nBeckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side LA Galaxy. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.[109]\n\nThe announcement made global headlines and elevated the league's profile. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250\u00a0million,[110] the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).[111] To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5\u00a0million in total or $6.5\u00a0million per year.[91][112]\n\nThe high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20\u00a0million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the Home Depot Center).[113] LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as Shanghai and Beijing, where the company had been working aggressively for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO Tim Leiweke put it as follows: \"Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed\".[114]\n\nIn the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25\u00a0million whenever he stopped playing in the league[115] \u2013 an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.[113] The league had a salary cap in place, requiring the creation of the Designated Player Rule for Beckham to bypass the cap; the rule was later nicknamed in his honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2\u00a0million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.[116]\n\nBeckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.[117] Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.[118]\n\nIn parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated, a few weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"F\u00fatbol meets Football\" starring Beckham and NFL running back Reggie Bush, and W magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by Steven Klein. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air David Beckham: New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400\u00a0million headquarters in Century City with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.[119] That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special Victoria Beckham: Coming to America aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.[120]\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer.[121] With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.[116] As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than the British Open golf tournament, a regular-season Major League Baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.[116]\n\nThe day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood A-listers, the lavish event was well-covered in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.[122]\n\nBeckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches \u2013 three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le M\u00e9ridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.[123]\n\nTwo weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute.[124] Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pav\u00f3n failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment \u2013 the Galaxy lost 1\u20130. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.\n\nBeckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.[125] He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2\u20130 victory, and a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August.\n\nDuring the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an MRI scan revealing that he had sprained his medial collateral ligament and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1\u20130 loss to the Chicago Fire. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league).\n\nBeckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.[126] Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the San Jose Earthquakes in the ninth minute.[127] On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 3\u20131, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70\u00a0yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.[128] Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.\n\nIn 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under Fabio Capello led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, AC Milan announced that Beckham was to join them on loan from 7 January 2009.[129] Despite this and other speculation, Beckham made it clear that the move in no way signalled his intent to leave MLS and announced his intent to return to the Galaxy in time for the start of the 2009 season in March.[130] Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing move.[131]\n\nBeckham was unveiled at Milan's training facility by the club's chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club vice captain Massimo Ambrosini, respectively. The day after his unveiling, Beckham was brought to San Siro where he got introduced to home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus Udinese and proclaiming \"Forza Milan\" over the public address system.[132] Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5\u20131.[133]\n\n\"On the pitch, Beckham sees everything before everyone else. His vision of play is better now than during his time in Manchester. He is slower but much stronger tactically and technically. He is very intelligent and works a lot.\"\n\n\u2014AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti on Beckham's condition at 33 years old.[134]\n\nPlaying on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kak\u00e1 in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers \u2013 such as 28-year-old Ronaldinho and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo \u2013 as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89\u00a0minutes of the 2\u20132 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico.[135] Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start.[136] In Beckham's home debut against Fiorentina a week later, he turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1\u20130 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kak\u00e1, imploring him to stay.[137]\n\nA noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4\u20131 victory over Bologna on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.[138] Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the 2010 World Cup. Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10\u201315\u00a0million range.[139]\n\nStill, negotiations continued during a month of speculation.[140] On 2 March, the Los Angeles Times reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through mid-July.[141] This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was described as a unique \"timeshare\" deal, in which Beckham would play with L.A. from mid-July until the end of the 2009 MLS season.[142]\n\nAfter his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying \"Go home fraud\", and \"Part-time player\".[143] The Galaxy, however, had a much more successful season than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 Western Conference final after a 2\u20130 overtime victory over the Houston Dynamo.[144]\nIn the final on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to Real Salt Lake by 5\u20134 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1\u20131 draw. Beckham also scored in the shootout.[145]\n\nIn November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.[146] On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75\u00a0minutes of a 5\u20132 victory over Genoa.[147] On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76\u00a0minutes of the match at the San Siro \u2013 which ended 3\u20132 to Manchester United \u2013 before being substituted for Clarence Seedorf.[148]\n\nBeckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3\u20130 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4\u20130, winning the tie 7\u20132.[149] Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.[150]\n\nIn Milan's next game, against Chievo, Beckham suffered a torn left Achilles tendon,[151] causing him to miss the World Cup as well as the MLS season due to the injury, which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor Sakari Orava performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in Turku, Finland, on 15 March 2010.[152] After the operation, Orava affirmed that, \"it went quite fine. The prognosis is he needs a rehabilitation for the next few months, and the plaster cast is the next six to eight weeks. I would say that [it will be] maybe four months before he's running, but six months before he's jumping and kicking.\"[153]\n\nOn 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3\u20131 win over Columbus Crew.[154] On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2\u20131 win over Chivas USA to mark his first goal in 2010.[155] On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season in the Galaxy's 2\u20131 win over FC Dallas which secured them their second successive Western Conference title and first MLS Supporters' Shield since 2002.[156]\n\nDuring January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.[157] As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.[158]\n\nOn 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4\u20131 victory over Sporting Kansas City.[159] On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2\u20131 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for Preston North End.[160]\n\nAfter having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won league titles in three countries, when Los Angeles won their third MLS Cup against the Houston Dynamo, winning 1\u20130 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player Robbie Keane.[158][161]\n\nFollowing the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive Supporters' Shield, having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with Paris Saint-Germain, but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.[162][163][164][165] In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by President of the United States Barack Obama at the White House.[166]\n\nBeckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. The Galaxy defeated Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the San Jose Earthquakes, and Seattle Sounders FC on their way to the MLS Cup final, where they defeated the Houston Dynamo 3\u20131 to retain the cup.[167] He was subbed off in the 89th minute for Marcelo Sarvas and was given a standing ovation at their home venue.[168] Beckham had earlier announced that the 2012 MLS Cup Final would be his final game with the Galaxy despite having another year remaining on his contract.[169][170]\n\nOn 31 January 2013, ahead of the transfer deadline it was announced that Beckham would be undergoing a medical with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of a potential move to the Ligue 1 side.[171] Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club later that afternoon and confirmed that his entire salary during his time in Paris would be donated to a local children's charity.[172] His PSG debut came on 24 February 2013, when he came off the bench in the 76th minute in a Ligue 1 home match against Marseille. This made him the 400th player in the history of the club.[173] On 12 May 2013, Beckham won a fourth different top flight winners' medal after PSG beat Lyon 1\u20130 to claim the Ligue 1 title.[174]\n\nOn 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of that year's French football season.[175][176] Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Beckham was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife and children stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final home game against Brest.[177] In this game, Beckham assisted a goal by Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed off after 80 minutes, receiving hugs from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from fans.[177] PSG went on to win the game 3\u20131.[177]\n\nBeckham made his first appearance for the England national team on 1 September 1996, in a FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Moldova.[179] In June 1997, he participated in the Tournoi de France, the friendly international football tournament held in France as a warm-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup.[180]\n\nBeckham played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and was part of the 23-man squad for the finals in France,[181] but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,[182] and he did not start in either of England's first two games. He was picked for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free kick in a 2\u20130 victory, which was his first goal for England.[183]\n\nIn the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against Argentina.[184] Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego Simeone, kicked Simeone while lying on the floor, striking him on the calf muscle.[184] Sports Illustrated was critical of the Argentinians' theatrics in that incident, stating that Simeone first delivered a \"heavy-handed challenge\" on Beckham and then \"fell like a ton of bricks\" when Beckham retaliated.[185] Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, urging the referee to send Beckham off.[186] The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the World Cup.[187]\n\nThe abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during England's 3\u20132 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.[188] Beckham responded by raising his middle finger and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.[189]\n\n\"We've played two and a half minutes of stoppage time. England trail by 2 goals to 1. Beckham could raise the roof here with a goal\u00a0... I don't believe it! David Beckham scores the goal to take England all the way to the World Cup Finals!\u00a0... Give that man a Knighthood!\"\n\n\u2014Television commentary on Beckham's stoppage time 30-yard curling free-kick against Greece in the 2002 World Cup qualifying game in October 2001.[190]\n\nOn 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan's resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager Peter Taylor, and then kept the role under new manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson.[191]\n\nBeckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in an impressive 5\u20131 victory over Germany in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against Greece on 6 October 2001.[192] England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2\u20131 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham was fouled eight yards outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark.[192] Beckham was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001, and finished runner-up to Lu\u00eds Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[193]\n\nBeckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against Sweden. After the events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty.[194] England defeated Denmark in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3\u20130 win. England were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil after Ronaldinho scored the winner.[195]\n\nThe following month, at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen. Beckham played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004. He had a penalty saved in England's 2\u20131 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout in the quarter-final match against Portugal.[196] England lost the shootout thus going out of the competition.[196]\n\nBeckham became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.[197] In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against Austria made him the first England captain to be sent off and the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month.[191]\n\nIn England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1\u20130. In England's next match, played against Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1\u20130. Beckham gave another assist to Steven Gerrard. In the end they won 2\u20130. He was named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser.\n\nDuring England's second round match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups,[198] and giving England a 1\u20130 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England.[198] In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3\u20131), the score having been 0\u20130 after extra time.[199] After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.[200]\n\nA day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain,[191] stating, \"It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95[201] games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under Steve McClaren.\" (Beckham had won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain John Terry.[202]\n\nHaving stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren said that he was \"looking to go in a different direction\" with the team, and that Beckham \"wasn't included within that.\"[203] McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson, and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, Aaron Lennon, were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role.\n\nOn 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain John Terry. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, Beckham sent two trademark assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch, helping England to prevail 3\u20130. Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games,[204] and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to Major League Soccer.\n\nOn 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against Germany, becoming the first to play for England while with a non-European club team.[205] On 21 November 2007, Beckham earned his 99th cap against Croatia, setting up a goal for Peter Crouch to tie the game at 2\u20132. Following the 2\u20133 loss, England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 Finals. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for the national team.[206] After being passed over by new England coach and Beckham's former manager at Real Madrid, Fabio Capello, for a friendly against Switzerland which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive match in three months.[207]\n\nOn 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.[208]\n\nOn 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham \u2013\u00a0who wore a pair of golden boots to mark the occasion \u2013 was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision.[209][210] In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.[211]\n\nDuring the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3\u20131 in Minsk, Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most-capped player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart Downing in a friendly match against Spain.[212] On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Slovakia, providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process.[213] In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[214] His last game for England before injury had been on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying game, which ended England 3\u20130 Belarus.[214]\n\nAfter a poor performance from England at the World Cup, Capello remained as manager but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month.[214] In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for England, that \"I need to change it. David is a fantastic player but I think we need new players for the future\", referring to the new players that play in Beckham's right midfield position, including Theo Walcott and Adam Johnson, adding \"This is the future of the team under Fabio Capello or another manager.\"[214] He said that Beckham may be selected for one last friendly game, stating, \"If he is fit, I hope we will play one more game here at Wembley so the fans can say goodbye.\" In response to the comments, Beckham's agent released a statement reiterating Beckham's position that he had no desire to retire from international football, and would always make himself available for selection for England if fit and if needed.[214] He remained 10 caps short of the record number of 125 caps by goalkeeper Peter Shilton, for a player of any position.[214] Beckham was named in the provisional squad to represent the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics.[215] He was not included in the final selection by manager Stuart Pearce, while Andy Hunt, the head the British Olympic Association, contacted Beckham's representatives for him to be related to Team GB more broadly.[216]\n\nThroughout his career, Beckham was considered one of the best and most recognisable players of his generation, as well as one of the greatest free-kick exponents of all time.[8][9][217] Predominantly right-footed, his range of passing, vision, crossing ability and bending free-kicks enabled him to create chances for teammates or score goals, attributes that saw him excel as a right winger despite his lack of significant pace.[218][219][220] Unlike his Manchester United teammate Ryan Giggs on the opposite wing, Beckham preferred to beat players through his movement and passing, rather than going at opponents directly with the ball.[221] He formed a strong partnership on the right side of the pitch with full-back Gary Neville during his time with the club, due to their understanding, as well as Neville's ability to get forward with his overlapping runs, get on the end of Beckham's passes, and deliver crosses into the box whenever the latter was heavily marked.[222][223]\n\nAlthough Beckham primarily played on the right flank, he was also used as a central midfielder throughout his career (occasionally with Manchester United, but in particular with Real Madrid and AC Milan),[137][224][225] and on rare instances as a deep-lying playmaker, in particular in his later career, in order to compensate for his physical decline with his advancing age.[226][227] Beckham felt that his best role was on the right, although he personally preferred playing in the centre.[228] In addition to his passing, crossing, and prowess from set-pieces, Beckham also stood out for his stamina and defensive work-rate on the pitch, having played both as an attacking midfielder and as a box-to-box midfielder in his youth;[225][229][230] he was also occasionally deployed as a wing-back.[231] Moreover, he was also an accurate striker of the ball from distance,[225][232] as well as being a competent penalty taker.[232][233] He also drew praise in the media for his ball control[234] and ability to create space for himself on the pitch,[235] as well as his anticipation, composure, determination, athleticism, dedication, and intelligence as a footballer.[220][236][237]\n\n\"David Beckham is Britain's finest striker of a football not because of God-given talent but because he practises with a relentless application that the vast majority of less gifted players wouldn't contemplate.\"\n\n\u2014Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.[238]\n\nBeckham was a product of Sir Alex Ferguson's hard-working approach at Manchester United. Ferguson said that Beckham \"practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about.\"[218][239] Beckham reportedly spent hours practising his free kicks after training sessions had ended.[219][238][240]\n\nBeckham maintained his training routine at Real Madrid and even when his relationship with management was strained in early-2007, Real Madrid president Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n and manager Fabio Capello praised Beckham for maintaining his professionalism and commitment to the club.[241] Beckham's Real Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos regarded Beckham to be the best free-kick exponent he had ever seen.[242] Two of the best free kick exponents of their generation, Roberto Carlos commented on the dilemma the team faced when they won a free kick on the edge of the penalty area: \"I would stand on one side and Beckham on the other but I wanted to see Beckham take the free-kick because it's beautiful how he hits the ball.\"[242] During Beckham's time with Milan, his manager Carlo Ancelotti praised the Englishman for his intelligence and work-rate, in particular the improvements he demonstrated to the technical and tactical aspects of his game, which allowed him to compensate for his loss of pace.[134]\n\nHis former England manager Steve McClaren stated: \"I've been very fortunate to work with some great players and he [Beckham] was one of them. He was a great player, he made the very most of his talents and that was through sheer hard work, professionalism, always doing extra on the training field. He inspired his team-mates through his performances, he was a winner. He was a leader, people followed him.\"[243] Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger stated, \"What remains in your memory is his genuine commitment and dedication, his natural humility which he always had, that will stay forever.\"[244]\n\nIn May 2013, asked about how he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, \"I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that \u2013 every time I stepped on the pitch \u2013 I've given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look back on it and hope people will see me.\"[238]\n\nEarlier in his career, Beckham's discipline during matches was brought into question on occasion in the media, due to his temper, as well as his tendency to commit rash challenges and pick up unnecessary bookings.[245][246] Beckham was the first England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off.[247] Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.[184] Along with Wayne Rooney, he holds the record for the most red cards for England at international level.[248] His second red card for England came on 8 October 2005, in a 2006 World Cup qualifier against Austria in Manchester.[249]\n\nHis only red card with Manchester United came on 6 January 2000, in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship against Necaxa.[249] During his time at Real Madrid, he amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in La Liga; he also received a red card in a Copa del Rey match against Valencia on 21 January 2004, in Madrid.[249][250] His only red card with LA Galaxy came on 15 August 2009, in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Seattle Sounders in the MLS.[251][252] He received one red card while at Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 picked up in injury time \u2013 in a match against Evian on 28 April 2013.[253] Between 2000 and 2013, Beckham played 572 competitive games for England, Milan, LA Galaxy, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG, and he received nine red cards \u2013 one every 63\u201364 matches, on average.[250]\n\nDespite his success, popularity, and playing ability, critical reception of Beckham was often divided among sporting figures and fans throughout his career, in part \u2013 as Subhankar Mondal of Goal.com notes \u2013 due to his ventures off the pitch and the widespread coverage that his personal life received.[254] His former Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, speculated in 2007 that Beckham's increasing celebrity status, in particular following his highly publicised relationship with his future wife Victoria, had actually had a negative impact on his playing career.[255] In 2015, moreover, he claimed he had only coached four world class players throughout his time at United, excluding Beckham from the list, commenting: \"I don't mean to demean or criticise any of the great or very good footballers who played for me during my 26-year career at United, but there were only four who were world class: Cantona, Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo and Scholes.\"[256]\n\nUpon his departure to LA Galaxy, El Pa\u00eds reflected on the dichotomy of Beckham's playing career and his status off the pitch, describing him as \"the great paradox of world football,\" also adding: \"He is the greatest icon on the planet and the cause of such delirium in the media and on the streets, the greatest catwalk model there is. And yet he has been an anti-diva. He was the most galactic of the galacticos off the pitch, but the greatest of earthlings when he walked on to the field.\"[257] Regarding Beckham's crossing ability, Rob Smyth of The Guardian said in 2014: \"he was a great crosser and perhaps the greatest of all time,\" also noting that \"he was a dead-ball specialist and also a dying-ball specialist: [...] his signature crosses in open play involved a ball that was barely moving, which allowed him to use the same technique as with corners and free-kicks.\"[258] Nigel Reed of CBC Sports commented on Beckham's career and celebrity status, stating: \"His brand is global, his appeal universal. He sparked debate and polarized opinion. But underneath the gloss he was, first and foremost, a very good footballer.\" He also added that while he felt that \"Beckham was not the greatest player of his generation,\" he believed he had the ability to change games, describing him as \"master of his art and a deadly opponent,\" whose \"talent was only topped by his passion.\"[236]\n\nIn 2005, Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy football school, operating from two sites, in London and Los Angeles. It was announced in late-2009 that both would close.[259] A mobile academy is being developed by Beckham, to travel around the UK and further afield.[260]\n\nOn 5 February 2014, MLS announced that Beckham had exercised his option to buy a MLS expansion team for $25\u00a0million, which he had received as part of the contract he signed with the LA Galaxy in 2007.[115] The ownership group, led by Beckham, originally hoped the Miami-based team would begin play in 2016 or 2017.[33] After delays getting a stadium deal completed, MLS announced in January 2018 that the team had been approved and would likely begin play in 2020.[261] The team name and crest were revealed on 5 September. Club Internacional de Futbol Miami \u2013 more commonly known as, Inter Miami \u2013 is represented by a black crest with neon pink trimmings and herons whose legs clasp to form an \"M\" for Miami.[262][263]\n\nThe club made its MLS debut on 1 March 2020 with a 1\u20130 away loss to Los Angeles FC.[264]\n\nIn January 2019 it was announced that Beckham was set to join his Class of '92 teammates as part owner of English non-league club Salford City, taking 10% of the club previously held by Peter Lim,[265] with the deal being subject to Football Association approval. On 31 January, the club announced that the FA had approved him to become a director of the club.[266]\n\nIn 1997, Beckham started dating Victoria Adams after she attended a Manchester United match.[267][268][269] She was famously known as \"Posh Spice\" of the pop music group Spice Girls, one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed \"Posh and Becks\" by the media.[270] He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in Cheshunt, England. Their first child was born fourteen months later.\n\nOn 4 July 1999, they married at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. Beckham's teammate Gary Neville was the best man,[267] and the couple's four-month-old son, Brooklyn, was the ring bearer.[271] The media were kept away from the ceremony, as the Beckhams had an exclusive deal with OK! Magazine, but newspapers were still able to obtain photographs showing them sitting on golden thrones.[272] 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost \u00a3500,000.[273]\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born 4 March 1999 at Portland Hospital, London),[274] Romeo James (born 1 September 2002 at Portland Hospital, London),[275] Cruz David (born 20 February 2005 at Ruber International Hospital, Madrid),[276] and daughter Harper Seven (born 10 July 2011 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles).[277] Elton John is godfather to Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley.[278] Harper and Cruz were baptized Catholic at Holy Trinity, Chipping Norton; among their godparents were Eva Longoria and Marc Anthony.[279]\n\nBeckham's three sons have all played football in the Arsenal Academy.[280] Like their father, Brooklyn and Romeo have both done modelling work and been named among GQ's best dressed British men.[281] Brooklyn previously played football for Arsenal U16,[280] but was released at the end of the 2014\u201315 season.[282]\n\nIn his early-Manchester United career, Beckham lived in a four-bedroom house in Worsley that he bought directly from the property developer as a 20-year-old in 1995.[283] In 1999, shortly after his wedding he and Victoria bought a country house set in 24 acres (10 hectares) in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, which the media nicknamed \"Beckingham Palace\".[284][285]\n\nKnown by the nickname \"Golden Balls\",[286][287] Beckham acquired the name from Victoria, who revealed it on national TV in 2008 while praising him for rebuilding his reputation after the 1998 World Cup.[287][288]\n\nBeckham suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which he says makes him \"have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs.\" Victoria Beckham claims, \"If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges \u2013 food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number.\"[289]\n\nA staunch monarchist, Beckham queued for 13 hours in September 2022 to see Queen Elizabeth ll lying in state at Westminster Hall following her death, after refusing opportunities to skip ahead.[290][291]\n\nIn April 2004, the British tabloid News of the World carried claims by Beckham's former personal assistant Rebecca Loos that he and Loos had an extramarital affair.[292][293] A week later, the Malaysian-born Australian model Sarah Marbeck claimed that she had slept with Beckham on two occasions. Beckham dismissed both claims as \"ludicrous\".[294]\n\nIn September 2010, Beckham announced that he was making a court application against prostitute Irma Nici and several others over claims in the magazine In Touch that he had sex with her.[295] His court application was dismissed under US freedom of speech laws and the magazine later accepted that the allegations against Beckham were untrue.[296][297]\n\nOn 9 May 2019, at Bromley Magistrates Court, Beckham was banned from driving for six months. He previously pleaded guilty to using a mobile phone while driving his Bentley in central London on 21 November 2018. The court heard he was photographed by a member of the public holding a phone as he drove in \"slowly moving\" traffic. Beckham received six points on his licence to add to the six he already had for previous speeding matters. He was also fined \u00a3750, and ordered to pay \u00a3100 in prosecution costs and a \u00a375 surcharge fee within seven days.[298]\n\nAs of 2021[update], Beckham has more than 65 tattoos covering a large part of his body, including tattoos on his hands, neck and head.[299] There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in the Devanagari script (used for the Hindi and Sanskrit languages, among others) because Beckham thought it would be \"tacky\" to have it in English. However, this was misspelt as the equivalent of \"Vhictoria\".[300] In his autobiography David Beckham: My Side, he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: \"When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me.\"[301]\n\nHe has also added several tattoos that pay tribute to his daughter, Harper, as well as several tattoos with religious significance.[302] In 2018, Beckham added to his collection with a tattoo of a solar system covering the left side of his scalp.[303] Many of Beckham's tattoos were completed by the Manchester-based tattoo artist Louis Molloy.[304]\n\nBeckham's relationship and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part of the Spice Girls, contributed to his celebrity beyond football.\n\nBeckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, and perfume and cosmetics manufacturers. Early endorsements included the British hair styling brand Brylcreem for \u00a34 million in 1997 which saw him appear in UK commercials.[305] In 2002 he was hailed as the ultimate \"metrosexual\" by the man who invented the term[306] and has been described as such by numerous other articles since.[307] The various iconic hairstyles he sported throughout his career \u2013\u00a0including a buzz cut, a Mowhawk, and a ponytail \u2013 were widely covered in the media.[308][309] This honorific has been in dispute, however, since Beckham signed a deal with Qatar to become a brand ambassador for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[310] While heterosexual, Beckham actively courted a gay fanbase and openly supported gay media, preferring to give interviews to publications that supported the LGBTQ community. He came to be called a \"gay icon\" \u2013 a term he embraces \u2013 for his popularity and support among the gay community.[311] Qatar persecutes LGBT people, causing many gay fans of Beckham and public LGBTQ figures such as Joe Lycett and Josh Cavallo to demand his status as a gay icon be rescinded.[312][313] Beckham defended his status as a brand ambassador in a statement on 18 November, saying that the World Cup will be \"[a platform for] progress, inclusivity and tolerance\".[314] On 20 November, Lycett responded on a livestream by appearing to shred \u00a310,000 that he had promised would be given to charity had Beckham pulled out of the deal,[315][316] which Lycett later revealed to have faked.[317]\n\nThe Beckhams were paid $13.7\u00a0million in 2007 to launch his fragrance line in the United States[318] In the world of fashion, David has already appeared on the covers of many magazines. US covers have included the men's magazine Details, and with his wife for the August 2007 issue of W.[319] According to Google, \"David Beckham\" was searched for more than any other sports topic on their site in 2003 and 2004.[320][321] According to Ask Jeeves, Beckham ranked third, after Britney Spears and Osama bin Laden, among subjects most searched for by British users of that site in the first decade of the 2000s.[322]\n\nUpon their arrival in Los Angeles on 12 July 2007, the night before Beckham's formal introduction, Los Angeles International Airport was filled with paparazzi and news reporters.[323] On the next night, Victoria appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to talk about their move to LA, and presented Leno with a number 23 Galaxy jersey with his own name on the back. Victoria also talked about her NBC TV show Victoria Beckham: Coming to America.[324] On 22 July, a private welcoming party was held for the couple at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. A-list celebrities attending included Steven Spielberg, Jim Carrey, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Oprah Winfrey.[325]\n\nBeckham's many endorsement deals make him one of the most recognizable athletes throughout the world. Having worn Adidas football boots from the start of his career (notably Adidas Predator), in 2003 he signed a $160\u00a0million lifetime contract with Adidas, earning nearly half the money upfront, and will continue to earn percentages of profits on all of his branded Adidas products.[326] His 2004 Adidas television commercial \"Kicking it\", in which he appears with England Rugby World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson, was voted among the best British commercials of the year, and also featured as one of the Great Ads of the 21st Century in Channel 4's 2004 update of The 100 Greatest TV Ads.[327][328] He had a 10-year collaboration with PepsiCo that expired in 2009.[329] He has also promoted The Walt Disney Company theme parks.[330] In 2021, he became a global ambassador for Maserati.[331]\n\nBeckham has several eponymous video games, including Go! Go! Beckham! Adventure on Soccer Island, a platform game for the Game Boy Advance, and David Beckham Soccer, a football game for a number of platforms,[332][333] and he was brand ambassador for exercise video game EA Sports Active 2.[334] Beckham featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was on the cover for the UK edition of FIFA 98. During his playing career (which ended in May 2013), Beckham generated an estimated \u00a31 billion in shirt and boot sales.[335] In 2006, Lloyd's of London insured his legs for \u00a3100m, at the time he was playing for Real Madrid.[336][337]\n\nBeckham played a critical part in bringing the Olympics to London in 2012, travelling with the British delegation to Singapore in 2005 for the host city selection.[338] At the 2008 Beijing Olympics closing ceremony, Beckham, Jimmy Page and Leona Lewis represented Britain during the handover segment for the 2012 Olympics. Beckham rode a London double-decker bus into the stadium and Page and Lewis performed \"Whole Lotta Love\".[339] He also featured at the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, carrying the Olympic flame to the stadium by speedboat.[340]\n\nBeckham visited Afghanistan in May 2010 for a morale-boosting visit to British troops fighting the Taliban insurgency.[341][342] The appearance of Beckham as well as British Foreign Secretary William Hague and Defence Secretary Liam Fox was believed to have prompted a Taliban attack on Kandahar airfield.[343][344]\n\nChinese authorities appointed Beckham as global ambassador for Chinese football in March 2013. After numerous officials had been banned for match-fixing, and the Chinese Super League had failed to retain the services of well-known international names, Beckham's role was to help improve the image of the game and raise its profile both in China and abroad.[345]\n\nFrom 14 July 2013, Beckham started appearing in adverts for BSkyB advertising their Sky Sports coverage via the Sky Go app.[346] In January 2014, Beckham appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC in the U.S., and in March he made a guest appearance in the BBC's Sport Relief special of Only Fools and Horses.[347] He was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed British men in 2015.[281]\n\nIn March 2015 Beckham had the third highest social media rank in the world among sportspeople, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, with over 52 million Facebook fans.[348] He also has over 57 million Instagram followers, the fourth highest for a sportsperson, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar, and the most for a person from the UK.[349][350]\n\nDuring the 2016 EU referendum, Beckham voiced his opposition to Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union) stating: \"For our children and their children we should be facing the problems of the world together and not alone. For these reasons, I am voting to remain.\"[351] Beckham was announced as the new Ambassadorial president of the British Fashion Council on 11 May 2018.[352] Prior to the June 2018 vote by FIFA member nations for selecting the hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Beckham endorsed the North American bid (Canada, Mexico and the United States).[353]\n\nBeckham's former club LA Galaxy unveiled a statue of him outside of their stadium in March 2019, the first of its kind in the MLS.[354] He was subject of prank by his friend James Corden who presented a 'hideous' fake statue before the real one was unveiled.[355]\n\nIn February 2020, Beckham mentioned that he enjoys spending hours assembling Lego pieces.[356] In June 2020, Beckham became a minority owner of the London-based esports organization Guild Esports.[357] In November 2020, EA Sports had an agreement with Beckham to feature him in FIFA 21, in which he would earn \u00a340m from a three-year deal.[358] In June 2021, Beckham bought 10% stake of vehicle electrification firm, Lunaz.[359]\n\nBeckham has supported UNICEF since his days at Manchester United and in January 2005, the English national team captain became a Goodwill Ambassador with a special focus on UNICEF's Sports for Development program.[30] In 2012, he met with UK Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street to call for more action to help children affected by malnutrition around the world.[360] In 2015, his tenth year as a UNICEF Ambassador, Beckham launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund to help protect children in danger.[30] In June 2015 he visited Siem Reap in Cambodia, where he met with child victims of violence.[30] Beckham has pledged his support for the Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS campaign. He is a former patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[361] In 2013, he also donated all his \u00a33.4 million salary taken from Paris Saint-Germain to two children's charities in France.[362] Beckham has been supporting the charity named Help For Heroes for many years whose aim is to help soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghan wars.[363]\n\nOn 17 January 2007, Rebecca Johnstone, a 19-year-old cancer patient from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, received a surprise phone call from Beckham. After the conversation, he sent her a Real Madrid jersey with his signature on it. Rebecca died on 29 January 2007.[364] On 1 July 2007, Beckham appeared as a speaker at the Concert for Diana held at Wembley Stadium, London to celebrate the life of Princess Diana almost 10 years after her death.[365] Proceeds from the concert went to Diana's charities as well as to charities of which her sons Princes William and Harry are patrons.[366][367]\n\nBeckham is a founding member of the Malaria No More UK Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with Andy Murray at Wembley Stadium. Beckham also appeared in a 2007 public service announcement for Malaria No More U.S., advertising the need for inexpensive bed nets. The TV spot aired in the United States on Fox Networks, including Fox Soccer Channel.[368] In November 2014, Beckham designed a Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty created by various celebrities (including Emma Watson and Kate Moss) which were located around London prior to the release of the film Paddington.[369] The statues were auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).[370]\n\nSince joining Major League Soccer, Beckham has been a very public advocate in the United States for related charities such as \"MLS W.O.R.K.S.\" On 17 August 2007, he conducted a youth clinic in Harlem, along with other current and former MLS players. This was in advance of his first New York City area match the following day against the New York Red Bulls. That team's Jozy Altidore and Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel were also with Beckham, teaching skills to disadvantaged youth to benefit FC Harlem Lions.[371]\n\n\"We may be a small country, but we're a great one, too.

Harmer also doubled for him in the party scene.[374] Beckham himself appears in the sequel Goal II: Living the Dream in a larger role, when the film's lead character gets transferred to Real Madrid.[375] This time, the story centres on the Real Madrid team, with other Madrid players also appearing on and off the pitch, alongside the fictional characters. Though the use of stock footage from the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Beckham appeared in Goal III: Taking on the World, which was released straight to DVD on 15 June 2009.[376]\n\nIn 2013, British business magazine Marketing Week wrote of his \"somewhat limited acting skills\".[305] Through his friendship with Guy Ritchie, he has made two cameo appearances in Ritchie's films: as a projectionist in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (based on the 1964 MGM television series of the same name),[377] and as Trigger in King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.[378]\n\nBeckham has played along to jokes about his voice.

He played college football at USC, where he earned consensus All-American honors twice and won the Heisman Trophy as the most outstanding player in the nation. Bush is widely regarded as one of the greatest college football players of all-time.[2] He was drafted by the New Orleans Saints second overall in the 2006 NFL Draft. While with the Saints, Bush was named an All-Pro punt returner in 2008 and won Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 over the Indianapolis Colts. He also played for the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, and San Francisco 49ers before retiring from professional football in 2017.\n\nIn addition to winning the 2005 Heisman Trophy, Bush also won the 2005 Doak Walker and Walter Camp awards. However, allegations that he received improper benefits were central to an NCAA investigation of the USC football program that led to severe NCAA sanctions against USC, including a two-year postseason ban and the vacating of the 2004 national championship. As a result, Bush voluntarily forfeited his Heisman Trophy.[3][4]\n\nBush was born in 1985 in Spring Valley in San Diego County, California,[5][6] and named after his biological father, Reginald, Sr.[7][8] He was a running back at Helix High School in La Mesa, California.[6] While at Helix, he played with 2004 Heisman Trophy finalist and first overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft Alex Smith.[9] During his prep career with the Helix Highlanders, he won the prestigious Silver Pigskin trophy awarded by KUSI's Prep Pigskin Report. Smith and Bush were later finalists for the 2004 Heisman, making it the first time a high school had two finalists at the same ceremony. He played in the 2003 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.[10]\n\nConsidered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Bush was listed as the No.\u00a01 running back in the nation in 2003.[11]\n\nBush was also a track star at Helix, placing second (10.72) -1.7m in the 2002 CIF California State Meet 100 meters final and posting bests of 10.42 seconds in the 100 meters (both the fastest prep time in the state and among the nation's senior football players) and 21.06 seconds in the 200 meters (third fastest prep in California in 2002). Bush is still 3rd all-time on the 100m dash all-time list for San Diego. He placed second in the boys' 50 meters, clocking at 5.85 at the 2003 Los Angeles Invitational Indoor Meet.[citation needed]\n\nBush received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Southern California, where he played for the Trojans from 2003 to 2005 under head coach Pete Carroll.[12] When Carroll recruited Bush he envisioned using him as a five-way threat.[clarification needed] The freshman quickly proved effective in carrying, catching, throwing, and returning the ball. Bush was a consensus first-team Freshman All-American selection in 2003, and became the first Trojan since Anthony Davis in 1974 to lead the Pacific-10 Conference in kickoff returns. His 1,331 all-purpose yards set a USC freshman record. The ESPN Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year also amassed 521 yards rushing that year, with three touchdowns on 91 carries.[13]\n\nUniversity of Utah quarterback Alex Smith and Bush were both finalists for the 2004 Heisman Trophy, making it the first time a high school had two finalists at the same ceremony.[14] In 2004, Bush finished fifth in the Heisman voting and was named the team's MVP. He earned consensus All-American honors and was a finalist for the Walter Camp Player of the Year Award.[15] He finished second on the team with 143 carries for 908 yards (6.3 avg) and six touchdowns, adding 509 yards and seven scores on 43 receptions (11.8 avg). Bush returned 21 kickoffs for 537 yards (25.6 avg) and 24 punts for 376 yards (15.7 avg) and a pair of touchdowns. He became the first Trojan since Marcus Allen to lead the Pac-10 in all-purpose yardage, totaling 2,330 yards. He also threw for one touchdown, tossing a 52-yard scoring strike.[16][17]\n\nIn 2005, Bush was a unanimous first-team All-American and winner of the Heisman Trophy.[18] He was also named the Associated Press College Football Player of the Year, the Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C. Offensive Player of the Year, and the Touchdown Club of Columbus (Ohio) Player of the Year.[19] In addition to the Walter Camp Award, Bush also won the Doak Walker Award, which is given to the nation's best running back.[20][21] He led the nation with an average of 222.3 all-purpose yards per game and finished fourth in the NCAA Division I-A ranks with an average of 133.85 rushing yards per game. He set the Pac-10 record for all-purpose yards in a game, with 513 (294 rushing, 68 receiving, 151 return) against the Fresno State Bulldogs on November 19, 2005. Bush also became known for the \"Bush Push,\u201d which occurred on a game-winning score against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.[16]\n\nBush led the Trojans with 1,740 yards on 200 carries (8.7 avg) with 16 touchdowns and ranked third on the squad with 39 receptions for 481 yards (12.9 avg), including a pair of scores as a junior. He returned 18 punts for 179 yards (9.9 avg) and a touchdown, and gained 493 yards on 28 kickoff returns (17.6 avg).[16][22][23]\n\nBush started only 14 times in 39 games at USC. However, he finished tenth in NCAA Division I-A history with 6,541 all-purpose yards, racking up 3,169 yards and 25 touchdowns on 433 carries (7.3 avg) and 1,301 yards with 13 scores on 95 catches (13.7 avg). Bush returned 67 kickoffs for 1,522 yards and a touchdown, adding 559 yards and three scores on 44 punt returns (12.7 avg). He also completed one of three pass attempts for a 52-yard touchdown.[16]\n\nBy the end of the 2005 season, Bush had amassed 2,611 all-purpose yards and scored 18 touchdowns (15 rushing, two receiving, one punt return).[24] He was awarded the Heisman Trophy on December 10, 2005. He had 784 first-place votes while University of Texas Longhorns quarterback Vince Young finished second with 79 first-place votes, an overall edge in voting points of 2,541 to Young's 1,608.[25] Teammate Matt Leinart came in third with 18 first-place votes. Bush had the second most first-place votes and the second-highest total points in the history of Heisman voting at that time, behind only O. J. Simpson's 855 in 1968.[26] Bush became the 71st winner of the Heisman Trophy, and the seventh USC player to receive the award. In addition to his Heisman Trophy, Bush also won the Doak Walker Award and Walter Camp Award, and was selected as the Pac-10's offensive player of the year.[27][28]\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Bush and Leinart became the first pair of Heisman Trophy winners to play together for the same team in a single game,[26] against the Longhorns in the Rose Bowl. Bush amassed a total of 279 all-purpose yards (82 rushing yards, 95 receiving yards, 102 kickoff return yards) and one touchdown, but he was overshadowed in a losing effort by Heisman runner-up Vince Young and Bush's teammate LenDale White, who led USC in rushing with 123 yards and three touchdowns. Bush also attempted to lateral when he was tackled after a long run in the second quarter, but the lateral fell to the ground and was recovered by the Longhorns.[29]  This game gave Bush a total of 6,890 all-purpose yards for his college career.\n\nIn 2006, reports surfaced raising questions about whether Bush's family received gifts in violation of NCAA policies.[30][31][32] The school requested that the conference investigate the matter, and Bush denied any impropriety.\n\nSports agent Lloyd Lake sued Bush and his family in November 2007 in an effort to recoup $291,600 in cash and gifts. Lake also agreed to cooperate with the NCAA.[33] In April 2009, the Los Angeles Times reported that the NCAA had merged its investigations of Bush and former USC basketball player O. J. Mayo into a single probe of the Trojans athletic programs.[34] On December 28, 2009, it was announced that Bush had lost his bid for confidential arbitration in this matter and that the case would proceed to trial.[35] The case was settled in April 2010.[36]\n\nOn June 10, 2010, the NCAA announced major sanctions against USC. The NCAA found that Bush had received lavish gifts from Lake and his partner, Michael Michaels, from at least December 2004 onward, including a limousine ride to the 2005 Heisman Trophy presentation. As a result, USC was given four years of probation and forced to vacate its last two wins of the 2004 season \u2013 including the 2005 Orange Bowl \u2013 as well as all of its wins in the 2005 season. The Trojans were also banned from bowl games in 2010 and 2011 and lost 30 scholarships over three years. Running backs coach Todd McNair was banned from off-campus recruiting for one year after the NCAA determined he had known about Bush's dealings with the agents. McNair sued the NCAA for damages related to his dismissal and the NCAA lost. The judge in the case found the NCAA conducted the USC investigation and that of McNair with \"malice\".[37] The NCAA also forced USC to disassociate itself from Bush.[38][39]\n\nThe NCAA determined that, given Bush's high-profile status, USC should have invested more effort in monitoring Bush's relationships. In announcing the penalties, NCAA infractions committee chairman Paul Dee said, \"High-profile players merit high-profile enforcement.\"[40]\n\nOn July 20, 2010, incoming USC president Max Nikias said the school would remove from its facilities all jerseys and murals displayed in Bush's honor, and would return the school's copy of Bush's Heisman Trophy.[41] On August 12, USA Today reported that Bush had called USC's new athletic director, Pat Haden, and apologized for making poor decisions that led to the NCAA sanctions.[42] However, in a subsequent report in the Los Angeles Times, Haden said the characterization of Bush's call as an \"apology\" was incorrect; Haden described it as \"a conversation of him being contrite, but not an apology\", and he also noted that Bush had not admitted to any specific wrongful acts.[43]\n\nAmidst reports that the Heisman Trophy Trust would strip his award,[44] Bush in September voluntarily forfeited his title as the 2005 winner.[3][4] The Heisman Trust decided to leave the award vacated with no new winner to be announced, although it is speculated by Bush and others that the NCAA offered the award to both Vince Young and Matt Leinart, something that Bush said Vince Young confirmed to him.[45][46] The San Diego Hall of Champions sports museum returned the copy of the award it possessed back to Bush's parents in 2011.[47] Bush eventually returned his trophy to the Heisman Trust in 2012.[48] On June 9, 2020 USC announced they would be ending their disassociation with Bush following the conclusion of the NCAA's mandated 10-year span.[49]\n\nIn a May 2020 interview with The Athletic, Bush said the sanctions against USC due to his conduct was \"One of the worst feelings in the world.\" and that the sanctions \"felt like I died when I had to hear that there weren't gonna be scholarships for kids because of me or because of something connected to me... I'm still not over that. It's just something you learn to live with.\"[50]\n\nAfter the NCAA ruled to allow players to make money from their name, image and likeness on June 30, 2021,[51] Bush began advocating for the reinstatement of his Heisman Trophy and various records. He has reached out to the NCAA and The Heisman Trust, specifically Michael Comerford, the President of the Heisman Trust. He received a call from Rob Whalen, the Executive Director stating that Comerford would not be corresponding with them.[52]\n\nOn January 12, 2006, Bush elected to forgo his senior season at USC and declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft. Bush's on field performances made him a contender for the top pick in the 2006 NFL Draft, and he also made an impressive appearance at USC's highly publicized post-season pro day showcase,[61] where he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds.[62] Draft analysts predicted that he would be the first overall pick in the draft, a pick held by the Houston Texans. However, in a surprising move on the night before the draft, the Texans signed Mario Williams, a defensive end from North Carolina State University, meaning that Bush would not be the first draft pick.[63] Bush's representatives spoke that night with the New Orleans Saints, who said they intended to use the second overall pick to select Bush.\n\nBush was indeed drafted by the Saints with the second overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.[64] The Houston Texans' decision to not take Bush was derided by many sports analysts. At the time, ESPN commentator Len Pasquarelli claimed that Houston selecting Williams ahead of Bush was one of the biggest mistakes made in NFL Draft history.[65]\n\nOn April 26, 2006, three days prior to the draft, Bush had signed a multi-year endorsement with Adidas to promote football and training clothes, and help the athletic sportswear company launch cleats in 2007.[66]\n\nBush's selection by the New Orleans Saints in the NFL Draft generated excitement and celebration among Saints fans. By the end of the week after the draft, Reebok reported receiving over 15,000 orders for Bush's Saints jersey, even though his jersey number with the Saints had not yet been determined.[68] Bush had petitioned the NFL to wear the number 5, which he has worn throughout his high school and college careers. However, in order for him to wear that number, the NFL would have to revise its numbering regulations, which require running backs to wear a number between 20 and 49. Bush was allowed to wear the number\u00a05 during the Saints' minicamp practices pending the NFL's ruling. On May 23, 2006, the NFL competition committee officially rejected his request, and on May 25 it was officially announced that Bush would be wearing number 25, acquired from Saints running back Fred McAfee. Although Bush had earlier pledged to donate a quarter of the money he received from jersey sales to Hurricane Katrina victims if allowed to wear the number 5, he later said he would make that donation no matter what number he wears.[69] As part of the deal with McAfee to wear the number 25, Bush agreed to allocate half the money to charities of McAfee's choosing, the other half going to charities of Bush's choosing. McAfee pledged to donate his share to Katrina victims in his home state of Mississippi.[70]\n\nBush was second to Peyton Manning in NFL endorsement deals, amounting to roughly US$5\u00a0million annually.[71] He signed contracts with Pepsi, General Motors, Adidas, Pizza Hut and the Subway restaurant chain.\n\nAmazed by the warm reception he received from the fans in New Orleans as well as the magnitude of the devastation caused there by Hurricane Katrina, Bush expressed excitement about playing with the Saints and pledged to help the city recover from the hurricane. On May 15, 2006, Bush donated US$50,000 to help keep Holy Rosary High School, a Catholic school for students with learning disabilities, from closing.[72] During training camp, Saints receiver Joe Horn dubbed him \"Baby Matrix\" because of his seemingly impossible evasive maneuvers (apparently comparing him to the movie The Matrix, which features characters who move faster than humanly possible to dodge bullets).\n\nBush's rookie season had both ups and downs, although as the season wore on he became more productive and integral to the Saints' surprising success. In the first game of Bush's NFL career, he amassed 141 total yards against the Cleveland Browns. He carried the ball fewer times than his counterpart Deuce McAllister, putting off any speculation that he would immediately supplant McAllister as the starter in New Orleans. The Saints won the game by a score of 19\u201314.[73] In his team's Week\u00a09 contest against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bush finished the game with minus-5 yards on eleven carries despite the Saints' 31\u201314 victory.[74] This effort lowered his league-worst rushing average among running backs to only 2.55 yards per carry. However, he finished the midway point of the season with 46 receptions, the most by any running back in the league.\n\nAt the midway point of the season, Bush had yet to score a touchdown either receiving or running the ball; however, on November 12, 2006, Bush rushed for his first touchdown from scrimmage on a reverse against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[75] On December 3, Bush tied the Saints' single-game touchdown record, held by Joe Horn, by scoring four touchdowns against the San Francisco 49ers. He gained 168 all-purpose yards as he sparked the Saints to their eighth win of the season.[76] On December 10, Bush scored a 62-yard touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys in Dallas, contributing to the Saints' 42\u201317 drubbing of the Cowboys in what was expected to be a more competitive matchup that would be important to the playoff race.[77] On December 24, Bush scored a one-yard touchdown on a reverse against the New York Giants. Bush also had a career-high 126 rushing yards on the day.[78] On December 31, Bush scored a one-yard touchdown against the Carolina Panthers but carried the ball only three times, even though backfield counterpart Deuce McAllister did not play.[79] This was because the New Orleans Saints had already clinched the No.\u00a02 NFC seed in the playoffs.\n\nIn the NFC Divisional Playoff game on January 13, 2007, Bush ran for 52 yards on twelve carries and scored a touchdown, and added three catches for 22 yards, as New Orleans edged the Philadelphia Eagles 27\u201324 to earn its first NFC Championship Game appearance in the team's 40-year history.[80] The game was also notable for the vicious hit that Bush absorbed from Sheldon Brown while attempting to catch a swing pass on the Saints' first play of the game. On January 21, in the NFC Championship playoff game, Bush caught a pass on the 22 and ran 78 yards downfield (eluding the Chicago Bears safety) for an 88-yard touchdown thrown by Drew Brees. This comeback was the first score of the second half and closed the gap from 16\u20137 (in favor of Chicago) to 16\u201314. That was the last time, however, the Saints would score. The Bears went on to trounce the Saints 39\u201314 to earn a berth to the Super Bowl.[81][82][83]\n\nBush was fined by the NFL after the game for US$5,000 for taunting: which consisted of wagging his finger at All-Pro linebacker Brian Urlacher and doing a somersault after the 88-yard reception score. Bush apologized immediately after the event.[84]\n\nIn the season opener of the 2007 season, Bush and the Saints lost to the defending Super Bowl champion Indianapolis Colts 41\u201310. Bush was tied for a team-best 38 rushing yards on 12 carries. He also had seven yards on four receptions and a punt return for two yards in a disappointing opener for him and the Saints.[85] Their next game was equally disappointing, as the Saints were beaten 31\u201314 by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Bush averaged 2.7 yards per carry and 27 yards from scrimmage \u2013 over a third of which came on one play.[86] Bush scored two rushing touchdowns, both one-yard runs, in the Saints' Week\u00a03 loss to the Tennessee Titans. In that game, Bush carried seven times for 15 yards while catching six passes for 20 yards.[87] Bush missed the final four games of the 2007 season with a partially torn posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.[88] Bush finished the season with six total touchdowns and 581 yards rushing, averaging 3.6 yards per carry.[89]\n\nBush and the New Orleans Saints faced the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to open the 2008 season. With Deuce McAllister out due to injury, Bush started the game.[90] He showed great improvement early in the season, particularly during Week\u00a03 against the Denver Broncos, in which he had 18 carries for 73 yards and two touchdowns, one touchdown that included a run up the middle, cutting back to the outside for 23 yards. He added a second touchdown on a six-yard swing pass from Drew Brees near the goal line. Bush ended the game with eleven receptions for 75 yards and one receiving touchdown.[91] Since he came into the league, no running back has caught more passes out of the backfield than Bush, who collected 171 receptions in his first two years. On October 6, in a home game against the Minnesota Vikings, he returned two punts for touchdowns and nearly had a third, tying an NFL record for single-game punt returns for touchdowns and becoming the 12th player to do so. In a home game against the Oakland Raiders on October 12, Bush tied the NFL record for fastest time to his 200th catch, doing so in only 34 games.[92][93]\n\nBush was injured in the October 19 game against the Carolina Panthers. He had surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee the next day and was expected to miss the next three to four games. Bush returned on November 30 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and registered three carries for no yards and five catches for 32 yards in a 23\u201320 Saints loss.[94] However, one week later he was back on track, producing over 100 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown catch in an important 29\u201325 home win against the division rival Atlanta Falcons to keep the Saints' slim playoff hopes alive.[95]\n\nOn December 11, Bush sprained his medial collateral ligament in his left knee in the Saints' 27\u201324 overtime loss on the road against the Chicago Bears. Although diagnosed as a sprain, given that it was the same knee he had surgery on earlier in the year \u2013 and that the Saints were now out of the playoff picture with only two games left in the 2008 season \u2013 Bush was placed on injured reserve, ending his season early for the second year in a row. He finished the season with 404 rushing yards on 106 carries, 440 yards receiving with 52 receptions and nine total touchdowns, playing in ten games.[96]\n\nOn January 7, 2009, the New Orleans Saints confirmed that Bush had surgery on his left knee, and would require months of rehabilitation. However, Bush was expected to be ready for minicamp in June.[97]\n\nOn August 16, 2009, Bush left practice due to continuing problems with his left knee, later to return with his knee wrapped in an icepack. Bush and the Saints said that he iced the knee as a precaution.[98] Bush missed the last three games of the 2009 preseason due to a calf injury and to rest his surgically repaired knee. Team officials called it precautionary in nature and stated that Bush would be ready to play during the regular season.\n\nBush missed games in Weeks 11 and 12 of the regular season due to soreness in his surgically repaired knee. He also missed most of game 15 due to a minor hamstring injury.\n\nBush experienced career lows in every major category for the 2009 season. While he had eight total touchdowns, good for third on the team, Bush was used sparingly during the year due to Mike Bell and Pierre Thomas dominating the backfield carries. Bush ended the year playing in 14 games with 70 carries for 390 yards and five touchdowns, and 47 receptions for 335 yards and three touchdowns.[99]\n\nOn January 16, 2010, in the NFC divisional playoff game against the Arizona Cardinals, Bush had one of the best games of his professional career. He rushed for 84 yards on only five carries, including a 46-yard touchdown run. This play was the longest run by a New Orleans Saints player in the postseason. He also added an 83-yard punt return touchdown late in the third quarter, the Saints' last score in their 45\u201314 win.[100][101]\n\nIn the NFC Championship Game against the Minnesota Vikings on January 24, Bush had only eight yards rushing on seven carries with two receptions for 33 yards, and he fumbled a punt return. However, one of his receptions was a late touchdown that helped the Saints win their first NFC championship and their first Super Bowl appearance and eventual victory in franchise history.[102][103]\nOn February 7, 2010, Bush won his first Super Bowl with a 31\u201317 win over the Indianapolis Colts in Miami.[104][105]\n\nBush's 2010 season was overshadowed by the controversy over his Heisman Trophy, as well as other matters related to his years at USC.[106] During the second regular-season game, a Monday Night Football contest with the San Francisco 49ers, he was injured while returning a punt. He did not return to the game. The injury was diagnosed as a broken bone in his right leg and he was expected to miss at least six weeks. He returned on Thanksgiving Day to play against the Dallas Cowboys.[107] Overall, he finished the 2010 season with 150 rushing yards and 34 receptions for 208 yards and a receiving touchdown.[108]\n\nOn July 28, 2011, the Saints traded Bush to the Miami Dolphins for reserve safety Jonathon Amaya and a swap of sixth-round draft picks.[109] After an 0\u20137 start, during the Dolphins' first win of the 2011 season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Bush scored his first rushing touchdown since 2009.[110][111] Bush had his second career 100-yard game against the New York Giants with 103 yards on 15 carries in the 20\u201317 loss.[112] In Week 13, Bush rushed 22 times for 100 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries in a 34\u201314 win over the Oakland Raiders.[113] Bush again eclipsed the 100-yard mark in a 26\u201310 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the following week, rushing for 103 yards on 14 carries.[114] On December 18, Bush rushed for a career-high 203 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries in a 30\u201323 win over the Buffalo Bills in Week 15. Bush rushed for 113 yards on 22 carries on Christmas Eve in a losing effort at the New England Patriots.[115] Early in the game, he eclipsed the 1,000-yard rushing mark in a season for the first time in his professional career. Overall, in the 2011 season, he finished with 1,086 rushing yards, six rushing touchdowns, 43 receptions, 296 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown.[116]\n\nAfter a solid season opener against the Houston Texans with 14 carries for 69 rushing yards in the 30\u201310 loss, Bush broke out on the ground with 172 yards on a career-high 26 carries and two rushing touchdowns, as well as 25 reception yards, in a 35\u201313 win over the Oakland Raiders.[117][118] Bush was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 2, the second time since joining the Miami Dolphins, and third time in his career.[119] In Week 15, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had 104 rushing yards in the 24\u20133 victory.[120] In Week 16, against the Buffalo Bills, he had 65 rushing yards, one rushing touchdown, and four receptions for 42 yards and two receiving touchdowns in the 24\u201310 victory.[121] Overall, on the season, he had 986 rushing yards, six rushing touchdowns, 35 receptions, 292 receiving yards, and two receiving touchdowns.[122]\n\nBush signed with the Detroit Lions on March 13, 2013.[123] Bush's contract with the Lions was a four-year deal, worth $16\u00a0million with $4\u00a0million guaranteed.[124] Yahoo! Sports' Jason Cole reported that Detroit planned to utilize Bush as a \"three-down back\" and Bush described playing for the Lions as a \"running back's dream.\"[125] He and Joique Bell shared the majority of the workload in the backfield.[126] On his debut for the Lions against the Minnesota Vikings, he recorded 191 yards from scrimmage and a receiving touchdown.[127] On September 29, against the Chicago Bears, he had 18 carries for 139 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 40\u201332 victory in Week 4.[128] In Week 10, in the second divisional game against the Chicago Bears, he had 14 carries for 105 rushing yards in the 21\u201319 victory.[129] In Week 13, against the Green Bay Packers, he had 20 carries for 117 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 40\u201310 victory.[130] Overall, on the 2013 season, he had 1,006 rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns, 54 receptions, 506 receiving yards, and three receiving touchdowns.[131] He was ranked 85th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[132]\n\nThe 2014 season saw Bush's production drop as Bell's production increased. His first rushing touchdown of the season came against the Green Bay Packers in Week 3 as part of a season-high 61-yard performance in the 19\u20137 victory.[133] He only topped 50 rushing yards once more and scored one more rushing touchdown, which came against the Chicago Bears in Week 16, in the 2014 season.[134] Overall, he finished with 297 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 40 receptions, and 253 receiving yards.[135] The Lions made the playoffs and faced off against the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round.

On November 1, 2015, during a game against the St. Louis Rams, Bush slipped on the concrete surrounding the field at the Edward Jones Dome and crashed into the wall. He suffered a season-ending tear of his left meniscus.[141] In limited action, he had eight carries for 28 rushing yards and four receptions for 19 receiving yards on the 2015 season.[142] On January 8, 2016, it was announced that Bush sued the St. Louis Rams, St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority and the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission, contending that what he described as a \"concrete ring of death\" around the field caused his injury.[143] On June 13, 2018, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Bush had won the lawsuit and that the Rams were ordered to pay Bush $12.45\u00a0million in damages: $4.95 million in compensatory damages and $7.5 million in punitive damages.[144] In making the ruling, the judge left the Rams as the sole defendant, dismissing the convention authority and sports complex from the suit.[144]\n\nOn August 1, 2016, Bush signed with the Buffalo Bills on a one-year deal.[145] He joined a backfield that was dominated by LeSean McCoy and Mike Gillislee.[146] Bush rushed for his first touchdown, and only rushing touchdown of the season, with the Bills on October 23, 2016 in a 28\u201325 loss to the Miami Dolphins.[147] Bush finished the season with seven catches for 90 yards, and 12 carries for \u22123 yards and a rushing touchdown,[148] making him the first player in NFL history, other than quarterbacks, to carry the ball at least ten times and have negative yardage for a season.[149]\n\nOn December 15, 2017, Bush announced his retirement from the NFL.[150]\n\nOn June 5, 2019, Bush was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame.[151]\n\nAt one time, Bush dated WWE Diva Eve Torres while at USC.[153] Bush then dated Kim Kardashian. Their relationship began after Matt Leinart introduced them at the 2007 ESPY Awards. They split on July 27, 2009[154] and got back together on September 28, 2009.[155] Bush was romantically linked to country singer Jessie James in 2010.[156]\n\nBush began dating Armenian dancer Lilit Avagyan in 2011[157] and the two married on July 12, 2014.[158] The couple have three children: daughter, Briseis (born May 6, 2013) [159] and sons, Uriah (born July 12, 2015)[160] and Agyemang (born September 2, 2017).[161]\n\n\nIn February 2007, Bush appeared as Ciara\u2019s love interest in the music video for her single, \u201cLike a Boy\u201d.\n\nOn June 26, 2007, David Beckham's first major US television advertising campaign since joining the Los Angeles Galaxy debuted via the internet. Titled \"Futbol Meets Football\", it paired Beckham with Bush in a 12-part video series, with additional television, radio and online promotion by Adidas.[162]\n\nIn August 2007, he signed a deal with Sirius Satellite Radio to be a weekly announcer for the 2007 season.[163]\n\nBush was nominated for Male Athlete of the Year at the 2007[164] and 2009[165] BET Awards.\n\nBush was featured almost shirtless on the February 2010 cover of Essence for the theme \"Black Men, Love & Relationships.\"[166] However, this appearance generated controversy as some among the magazine's readers took offense to Bush on the cover of such an issue; at the time he was involved with Kim Kardashian and Bush was criticized for dating only non-black women.[167]\n\nAlso in 2010, Bush's fundraising work for organizations that benefit Haiti and diamond-producing countries in Africa earned him a nomination for the VH1 Do Something Awards. Specifically, Bush worked on behalf of the Diamond Empowerment Fund, visiting Botswana and South Africa and raising money for education there. He is a founding member of the Fund's Athletes for Africa program.[168] The awards show, produced by VH1, is dedicated to honoring people who do good and is powered by Do Something, an organization that aims to empower, celebrate, and inspire young people.[169]\n\nIn March 2012, Bush became a partner and spokesperson for skincare company Barc, makers of BumpDown Razor Bump Relief.[170]\n\nIn 2018, Bush appeared as a contestant on Talk Show the Game Show with Guy Branum.[171]\n\nIn October 2022, he signed an ambassador deal with golf brand Srixon.[172]\n\nIn 2022, Bush appeared in a commercial for Wendy's.[173]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Bush"}, {"id": 2, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/114/2261935/original/tony-romo-photo-u24?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Tony Romo", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/tony-romo/2261935", "desc": "Antonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American football television analyst and retired quarterback who played 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL).

Beginning his career as a holder, Romo became the Cowboys'", "full_desc": "\n\nAntonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American sportscaster and former football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at Eastern Illinois University, where he made an Ohio Valley Conference championship appearance in 2001 and won the Walter Payton Award the following year. Romo signed with the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2003.\n\nBeginning his career in a backup role, Romo served as the Cowboys' primary starter from 2006 to 2015. He led the Cowboys to four postseason appearances during his tenure, while also receiving Pro Bowl honors amid each playoff run. Romo retired after the 2016 season when a preseason back injury caused him to lose his starting position to backup Dak Prescott. Upon retiring, he was hired by CBS Sports to become the lead color analyst for their NFL telecasts.\n\nRomo holds several Cowboys team records, including passing touchdowns, passing yards, most games with at least 300 passing yards, and games with three or more touchdown passes. He also held a higher passer rating in the fourth quarter than any other NFL quarterback from 2006 to 2013.[1] However, Romo's reputation was affected by a lack of postseason success, having won only two of the six playoff games he appeared in and never advancing beyond the divisional round.[2][3][4][5][6] His 97.1 passer rating is the highest among retired players who never appeared in the Super Bowl.\n\nRomo was born in San Diego, California to Ramiro Romo Jr. and Joan Jakubowski.[7] Romo is a \"Navy brat,\" as he was born while his father was stationed at the San Diego U.S. Naval Base. The Romos later returned to Burlington, Wisconsin, where Ramiro worked as a carpenter and construction worker and his wife, Joan, worked as a grocery store clerk.[8] Romo played baseball as a child and was selected to the Little League All-Star team.[9]\n\nRomo's paternal grandfather, Ramiro Romo Sr., emigrated from M\u00fazquiz, Coahuila, Mexico to San Antonio, Texas as an adolescent. The elder Romo cites Tony's success as an example of the possibilities afforded to immigrants in the United States: \"I've always said this is a country of opportunities. If you don't get a job or an education, it's because you don't want to.\"[10][11] Romo's mother has German and Polish ancestry.[12]\n\nRomo started as quarterback for the Burlington High School Demons beginning as a junior (1996 season). In the 1997 season, Romo and the Demons finished with a 3\u20136 record, though he earned several honors, including the All-Racine County football team and Wisconsin Football Coaches Association All-State first team honors. Romo also was a starter on the Burlington High School varsity basketball team and also played golf and tennis. In 1998, he joined Caron Butler on the All-Racine County (Wisconsin) team. With per-game averages of 24.3 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists, Romo was sought by some mid-major basketball schools in the NCAA such as Wisconsin-Green Bay.[13] Romo graduated from Burlington High School in 1998,[14] with his 1,080 points being the all-time scoring record for the Burlington basketball varsity.[13]\n\nRomo attended Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois, where he played for the NCAA Division I-AA Eastern Illinois Panthers football team and was a member of Sigma Pi.[15][16] As a sophomore in 2000, he ranked second in Division I-AA in passing efficiency, completing 164-of-278 (59%) passes for 2,583 yards and 27 touchdowns. After the season, he was honored as an All-America honorable mention, an All-Ohio Valley Conference member, and the OVC Player of the Year. As a junior, he led Division I-AA in passing efficiency, completing 138-of-207 passes for 2,068 yards and 21 touchdowns.[17][18]\n\nRomo earned OVC Player of the Week honors on October 14, 2002, after his eight-yard scramble run on the last play of the game led Eastern Illinois to a 25\u201324 win over Eastern Kentucky.[19]\n\nOn December 19, 2002, Romo became the first player in Eastern Illinois and Ohio Valley Conference history to win the Walter Payton Award, given annually to the top Division I-AA football player.[20] He finished his career holding school and conference records with 85 touchdown passes.[14] He finished second in school and third in conference history with 8,212 passing yards and second in school history with 584 completions and 941 attempts.[17] As a senior, he set school and conference records for completions with 258 in 407 attempts for 3,418 yards.[18] This was second in conference and third in school history for a season. He threw for 34 touchdowns and scored one rushing touchdown. Romo's 3,149 yards in total offense as a senior ranked third in school and conference history. Along with the Walter Payton Award, Romo earned consensus All-America honors. In addition, he was selected All-Ohio Valley Conference and was named OVC Player of the Year for the third straight year.[17]\n\nDuring homecoming weekend on October 17, 2009, Eastern Illinois University retired Romo's No. 17 jersey and inducted him into EIU's Hall of Fame. Romo is the first Eastern Illinois player to have his number retired. He said about the event, \"It was such an honor to be inducted into the Hall of Fame here, and with the jersey ceremony, it holds a special place in your heart.\"[21][22]\n\nOn December 7, 2021, Romo was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame as a member of the 2021 class.[23][24]\n\nRomo did not initially receive an invitation to attend the 2003 NFL Combine, but received a late invitation to attend as an extra quarterback to throw passes to other prospects during drills. Despite intriguing some scouts, he went undrafted by any NFL team during the 2003 NFL Draft. Throughout the draft, Romo was assured by Dallas assistant head coach Sean Payton of the Cowboys' interest (Romo was also intensely pursued by Denver Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan),[27] and shortly afterwards was signed as an undrafted rookie free agent by the Cowboys. Romo entered the 2003 training camp third on the Cowboys' depth chart behind Quincy Carter and Chad Hutchinson. In 2004, the Cowboys released Hutchinson and signed veteran quarterback Vinny Testaverde and traded a third-round draft pick to the Houston Texans for quarterback Drew Henson. Romo faced being cut from the roster until Carter was released following allegations of substance abuse. Throughout 2004 and 2005, Romo served as the holder for placekicks.[17] After Vinny Testaverde's tenure in Dallas ended in 2005, the Cowboys signed veteran quarterback Drew Bledsoe, the team's eighth starting quarterback since 2000.[28]\n\nOne of Romo's early career highlights was in 2004, when (as the third-string quarterback) he rushed for the winning touchdown with six seconds left in a preseason game against the Oakland Raiders.[29] Elevated to the Cowboys' second quarterback in 2005, Romo had strong showings in the 2005 and 2006 pre-seasons. In the 2006 off-season, Sean Payton (now head coach of the New Orleans Saints), offered a third-round draft pick for Romo, but Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones refused, asking for no less than a second-round draft pick.[30]\n\nRomo began the season as a backup to starter Drew Bledsoe. He took his first regular season snap at quarterback in a home game against the Houston Texans on October 15. His first NFL pass was a 33-yard completion to wide receiver Sam Hurd. His only other pass of the game was a two-yard touchdown pass, his first in the NFL, to wide receiver Terrell Owens.[31]\n\nOne week later, Romo replaced Bledsoe for the start of the second half of a game against the New York Giants. His first pass was tipped and intercepted. He finished with 227 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions (one of which was returned for a touchdown).[32] On October 25, Cowboys head coach Bill Parcells announced that Romo would be the Cowboys starting quarterback for the October 29 game against the Carolina Panthers on NBC Sunday Night Football, in Week 8.[33] Romo led the Cowboys to victory in his first game as a starter, 35\u201314.[34]\n\nOn November 19, Romo led the Cowboys past the Indianapolis Colts, the NFL's last unbeaten team. He completed 19 of 23 passes as the Cowboys won against the Colts 21\u201314.[35] Four days later he helped the Cowboys win in a Thanksgiving Day game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by the score of 38\u201310. Romo went 22\u201329 with 306 yards and a career-high five touchdown passes.[36] In the month of November, Romo won NFC Offensive Player of the Week twice, once for the Week 10 game against the  Arizona Cardinals and the other for Week 12 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[37][38]\n\nRomo aided the Cowboys in clinching a playoff spot, their second since Parcells became coach in 2003. He concluded the 2006 regular season with 220 completions on 337 pass attempts for 2,903 yards, 19 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions, with a passer rating of 95.1.[39]\n\nThe Cowboys played the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Wild Card Round on January 6, 2007. With the Cowboys trailing 21\u201320 on fourth-and-one with 1:19 left in the game, the Cowboys attempted a 19-yard field goal. Romo, the holder for the kick, fumbled the snap. He recovered the ball and attempted to run it in, but was tackled short of the first down marker, and turned the ball over on the Seattle 2-yard line. The Cowboys went on to lose the game.[40] Romo finished the 2006 season ranked seventh in the NFC in passing yards (2,903) and touchdown passes (19).[41]\n\nRomo played in the 2007 Pro Bowl after Drew Brees went down with an elbow injury as a substitution for Marc Bulger. He threw one touchdown and one interception, and was the NFC's kickoff holder in the game.[42]\n\nRomo began the 2007 season with four touchdown passes and an additional touchdown rush, the first of his career, defeating the New York Giants 45\u201335 in the Cowboys' first game of the regular season[43] He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 1.[44] Romo added 329 passing yards and two touchdown passes in the Cowboys' Week 3 34\u201310 win over the Chicago Bears.[45] The following week, he passed for 339 yards and three touchdowns in a 35\u20137 win over the St. Louis Rams. He ran for an additional touchdown.[46] Romo earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September.[47] In September 2007, Romo's father was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Romo stated that, while upset about the family crisis, he still had to continue to focus on his career.[48]\n\nIn Week 5, on Monday Night Football against the Buffalo Bills, Romo threw five interceptions (four in the first half, two of which were returned for touchdowns) and lost a fumble in the 25\u201324 victory.[49] He became the second person in the history of Monday Night Football to throw five interceptions in a winning effort.[50]\n\nOn October 29, Romo reached an agreement to a six-year, $67.5 million contract extension with the Cowboys.[51]\n\nOn November 29 against the Green Bay Packers, in a game between 10\u20131 teams, Romo threw four touchdown passes (bringing his season total to 33), breaking Danny White's (29) record from 1983.[52] He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Packers.[53] On December 22 against the Carolina Panthers, Romo became the first Cowboys' quarterback to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season.[54] December 30 against the Washington Redskins, Romo broke the Cowboys' season completions record with his 335th completion, a short pass to tight end Jason Witten.[55] The Cowboys finished the season with a 13\u20133 record.[56] He finished the 2007 season with 4,211 passing yards, 36 touchdowns,\tand 19 interceptions.[57] He earned a second consecutive Pro Bowl nomination.[58]\n\nIn the Cowboys' Divisional Round game against the New York Giants, Romo was unable to lead his team to a come-from-behind victory. On fourth down with less than half a minute and no timeouts left, Romo threw the ball into the end zone, but it was intercepted by Giants cornerback R. W. McQuarters, ensuring that the Cowboys were eliminated from the playoffs with a 21\u201317 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XLII champions.[59]\n\nOn September 7, 2008, Romo led the Cowboys to a 28\u201310 win over the Cleveland Browns in their season opener. Romo completed 24 of his 32 passes for a total of 320 yards and one touchdown.[60] After the game, Romo required 13 stitches for a large gash on his chin that occurred during the third quarter when linebacker Willie McGinest hit him in the chin with his helmet. The NFL fined McGinest $7,500 for the hit.[61]\n\nOn September 15, Romo led the Dallas Cowboys to a 41\u201337 win against the Philadelphia Eagles in the second game of the 2008 season. Romo completed 21 of his 30 passes for a total of 312 yards and three touchdowns. The 54 combined points scored by the Cowboys and Eagles in the first half were the second most points scored in a half during a Monday Night Football game.[62] That same month, Romo signed a 5-year, $10 million endorsement deal with apparel marketer Starter,[63] but was not allowed to wear footwear on the field as the company did not have a contract with the NFL.\n\nRomo and the Cowboys won their third straight before losing to the Washington Redskins, falling to 3\u20131.[64] Following a win against the Cincinnati Bengals, Romo was injured in a loss to the Arizona Cardinals.[65][66] The Cowboys, under Brad Johnson, went 1\u20132 the next three games, losing to the St. Louis Rams, beating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and losing to the New York Giants.[67]\n\nIn what became a de facto third playoff game for Romo shortly prior to its start, on December 28, Romo and the Cowboys failed to compete against the Philadelphia Eagles in a 44\u20136 loss. Romo committed three turnovers in the game and threw for 183 yards and no touchdowns.[68]  The loss dropped Romo's combined record in December to 5\u20138 and again raised questions about his performance in games of consequence.[69]\n\nRomo led the Cowboys to a 34\u201321 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in their season opener. He completed 16 of his 27 passes for a then-career-high 353 yards along with three touchdowns.[70]\n\nRomo and the Cowboys were defeated in week 2 against the New York Giants in the Cowboys home opener at their new Cowboys Stadium. Romo completed 13 of 29 passes for 127 yards and one touchdown. He also threw three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown for the Giants.[71]\n\nIn a Week 13 road game against the division rival New York Giants, Romo passed for a career-high 392 yards, along with three touchdown passes. He completed a career-high 41 passes in the 31\u201324 setback.[72]\n\nAfter several kicks were missed by kicker Nick Folk due to bad holds by punter Mat McBriar, Romo resumed holding duties for the first time since the 2006 in their 13th game of the season, versus the San Diego Chargers.[73]\n\nIn Week 15, Romo led the Cowboys to a win against an undefeated team late in the season for the second time in his career. On December 19, 2009, he defeated the 13\u20130 New Orleans Saints at New Orleans, throwing for 312 yards and one touchdown.[74] He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[75]\n\nRomo finished the 2009 season as the first quarterback in team history to take every snap for a full season. He also passed his own mark for single season passing yardage, with 4,483 yards, and became the first Cowboys quarterback to throw more than 20 touchdowns and fewer than ten interceptions in a season.[76] His eight 300 yard games was also a team record, surpassing his own record from 2007. His 1.6% interception percentage tied a team record, and his career interception percentage became the lowest in franchise history.[77]\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys became the NFC East division champions with their season finale shutout of the Philadelphia Eagles, the second division title in Romo's three full seasons as the starting quarterback.[78][79] Romo was named to the Pro Bowl for the third time in his career.[80]\n\nRomo had a 104.9 passer rating in a 34\u201314 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, earning the first playoff win in 13 years for the Cowboys, and his own first career post-season win.[81] However, the following week in the Divisional Round against the number two seed Minnesota Vikings, Romo had three fumbles (losing two), an interception and was sacked six times in the 34\u20133 loss.[82]\n\nIn Week 5 against the Tennessee Titans, Romo threw for a career-high 406 yards and three touchdowns. However, he also threw two costly interceptions in the fourth quarter, resulting in 34\u201327 loss at Cowboys Stadium.[83] Romo and the Cowboys were desperate for a win with a record of 1\u20133 and last in the division. They played against the Minnesota Vikings, who also had a 1\u20133 record and were in need of a win. Romo threw for over 200 yards and three touchdowns but also threw two costly interceptions. The Cowboys lost the game by a score of 24\u201321.[84]\n\nDuring the October 25, 2010 Monday Night Football game against the New York Giants, Romo suffered a broken left clavicle. The injury occurred during the second quarter, when Romo was driven to the turf by Giants linebacker Michael Boley.[85] He was placed on Injured Reserve on December 21, 2010, and replaced by veteran Jon Kitna.[86] He was ranked 72nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[87]\n\nRomo's 102.5 quarterback rating in 2011 was fourth best in the league behind Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, and Tom Brady, and second highest in Cowboys history.[88]\n\nRomo had four fourth-quarter comebacks in 2011.[89]\n\nIn Week 2 against the San Francisco 49ers, Romo suffered a broken rib and a punctured lung on a hit from Carlos Rogers in the second quarter that forced him to miss part of the game. Romo came back in the final seconds of the third quarter and played the fourth quarter throwing for a touchdown and driving down the field for the game-tying field goal with four seconds left in the game to force overtime. On the first offensive possession for the Cowboys in overtime, Romo connected with Jesse Holley for 77 yards to set up the 19 yard game-winning field goal. Romo finished the game with 345 yards and two touchdowns with a 116.4 rating despite the cracked rib and punctured lung. For his performance in this game, Romo earned the NFC's Offensive player of the Week Award.[90] Romo played with a protective vest for a few games to protect his torso.[91]\n\nIn Week 10, Romo posted the second highest quarterback rating of his career with a rating of 148.40 in Week 10 against the Buffalo Bills.[92]\n\nIn Week 16 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Romo suffered a severely bruised hand when he smashed it against an opposing player's helmet.[93] He left the game after attempting just two passes with no completions.[94] The next week, in the season finale at MetLife Stadium against the New York Giants, the NFC East title and a playoff spot was at stake for whichever team won, with the loser eliminated from playoff contention. Romo started the game despite the hand injury the previous week. He posted 29 out of 37 passing for 289 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for a 106.0 quarterback rating and a 78% pass completion rate (second highest of the season) as the Cowboys lost the game 31\u201314, dropped to an 8\u20138 record and were eliminated from playoff contention.[95][96]\n\nRomo accounted for 32 of the 39 total touchdowns the Cowboys scored in the 2011 NFL season (82.1%). No other player in the 2011 regular season contributed a higher percentage of team touchdowns (Cam Newton with 72.9% was second). Romo finished the 2012 season with 4,184 passing yards, 31 passing touchdowns, and ten interceptions.[97] He was ranked 91st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.[98]\n\nDaniel Jeremiah, an NFL.com analyst, ranked Romo as the 9th best quarterback in the league heading into the 2012 season.[99]\n\nRomo started the 2012 season with 307 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, and one interception in the 24\u201317 victory over the New York Giants.[100] In Week 8, in the second divisional matchup with the New York Giants, he passed for 437 passing yards, one passing touchdown, and four interceptions. He attempted a career-high 62 passes in the 29\u201324 loss.[101] In Week 12, against the Washington Redskins, he passed for 441 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions. He matched his career-best 62 pass attempts in the 38\u201331 loss.[102] In Week 13 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Romo threw three touchdown passes. The first pass, a 23-yard throw to Dez Bryant with 11:18 left in the third quarter, gave Romo 166 career touchdown passes, surpassing the previous franchise record of 165 which had been held by Troy Aikman.[103]\n\nAfter trailing the Cincinnati Bengals 19\u201310 with 6:35 left, Dallas beat Cincinnati 20\u201319 in Week 14 (December 9). The fourth quarter comeback consisted of a 27-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant and a last-second 40-yard field goal by Bailey. Romo went 25-for-43 for 268 yards, with one touchdown and one interception.[104]\n\nTopping a three-game winning streak and winning its fifth out of six games, Dallas beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 27\u201324 in overtime in Week 15 (December 16). The win put Dallas in a three-way tie with the New York Giants and Washington Redskins in the NFC East. Romo surpassed 25,000 career passing yards in this game with 30-for-42 passing for 341 yards and two touchdowns.[105]\n\nOn Week 16 (December 23), despite Romo's four touchdown passes and 416 passing yards (on 26-for-43 passing), Dallas lost to the New Orleans Saints, 37\u201334, in overtime.[106] Following that game, Dallas and the Washington Redskins faced off in Week 17 for the NFC East title, where Dallas lost 28\u201318. With overall 20-for-37 passing, Romo threw a total of three interceptions, including on Dallas' first two drives. With 5:50 left and down 21\u201310, Romo made a touchdown pass to Kevin Ogletree and two-point conversion pass to Dwayne Harris. After Dallas took over with 3:33 left down 21\u201318, Romo threw an interception to Redskins linebacker Rob Jackson, and Washington clinched the victory with another touchdown.[107] Dallas finished the 2012 season with an 8\u20138 record and failed to make the playoffs for the third straight season. While his 19 interceptions led the league, he was credited with five fourth-quarter comebacks.[108][109]\n\nFollowing the season, the future of Romo's career was called into question. Mac Engel of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram commented: \"Tony Romo has one year remaining on his contract, but the time has come for him to move on...He will be 33 in April of '13, and still has a few good years left but at this point he needs to go to another team that needs a quarterback.\"[110] In a Fox Sports Southwest interview, Rick Gosselin of The Dallas Morning News also called Romo \"not wired to win the last game of the season\" especially \"[i]f it means extending the season.\"[111] Dan Graziano of ESPNDallas.com wrote that Romo's \"record starts to become very hard to defend\" due to \"the oft-cited fact that he's got just the one playoff win in his entire career.\"[112]\n\nThe Cowboys signed Romo to a 6-year extension worth $108 million, with $55 million guaranteed and $25 million in bonuses, thus securing him for the rest of his career and relieving the pressure from the salary cap, which was reported to have less than $25,000 space before the deal was struck.[113] In the middle of April 2013, he underwent back surgery to remove a cyst. Although it was characterized as a minor procedure by the team, he would end up missing all of the mini-camp and organized team activities.[114]\n\nRomo opened the season with a win over the New York Giants, passing for 263 yards and two touchdowns.[115] He briefly left the game with a rib injury, but returned after halftime and finished the game. After Week 7, his 100th career start, Romo had thrown for 27,485 yards, the most by a quarterback in his first 100 starts since 1960.[116] In Week 5, against the Denver Broncos, Romo passed for a franchise-record 506 passing yards, five passing touchdowns, and one interception in the 51\u201348 loss.[117][118] The game was a memorable back-and-forth shootout between the two teams with Romo and Peyton Manning at the helm.[119]\n\nIn Week 16, against the Washington Redskins, with the Cowboys trailing in the fourth quarter and needing a win to keep its playoff hopes alive, he led the team to a touchdown drive with 1:08 remaining in a 24\u201323 victory, with what was later diagnosed as a season-ending herniated disk injury.[120] Head coach Jason Garrett would later say: \"He might have had his finest hour \u2026 We talk about mental toughness, being your best, regardless of circumstances. Somehow, some way, he helped us win that ballgame.\"[121]\n\nRomo underwent back surgery on December 27, 2013, and was placed on the Cowboys' injured reserve list. Garrett announced Kyle Orton as the starting quarterback for the Week 17 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, which the team lost 24\u201322, to miss the playoffs for a fourth straight year.[122] Romo finished the 2013 season with 3,828 passing yards, 31 passing touchdowns, and ten interceptions.[123] He was ranked 71st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014[124]\n\nAfter a poor performance in the season opening 28\u201317 loss versus the San Francisco 49ers, Romo and the Cowboys won six consecutive games, including back-to-back road games against the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams. The Cowboys also defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks on the road, becoming only the second team to win a road game against the Seahawks in the three seasons.[125] In Week 5, against the Houston Texans, Romo pulled off a memorable escape from J. J. Watt's pursuit on a play that resulted in Romo throwing a 43-yard touchdown in the 20\u201317 victory.[126] Through those six wins, Romo had a 13:3 touchdown:interception ratio. In Week 8, against the Washington Redskins, Romo went down with a back injury when linebacker Keenan Robinson sacked him, with his knee going into Romo's back. After the loss to Washington, it was revealed that Romo had two fractures in his transverse process.[127] He missed the next game, a 28\u201317 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, but came back the next week and went on to lead the Cowboys to a 12\u20134 record and their first divisional title since 2009.[128][129]\n\nOn December 21, Romo set the Dallas Cowboys team record for highest completion percentage in a game with 90%, completing 18 of his 20 passes in a 42\u20137 blowout win over the Indianapolis Colts.[130][131] He set his personal best quarterback rating in a single game with 151.7. Romo's 133.7 passer rating in the month of December was the highest in NFL history.[132] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[133] He was named to the Pro Bowl.[134]\n\nIn the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, Romo led the Cowboys to a 24\u201320 comeback victory over the Detroit Lions after being down 17\u20137 at halftime.[135] Romo was 19-of-31 for 293 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. In the Divisional Round, Romo and the Cowboys were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 26\u201321. Romo was 15-of-19 for 191 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions.[136] Romo was involved in a controversial sequence in the fourth quarter of the game. Romo completed a 31-yard pass to Dez Bryant on a fourth-and-2 play from the Packers' 32-yard line. Although Bryant caught the ball with both feet down in bounds, Bryant bobbled the ball as he made an attempt to reach for the endzone. Referees initially ruled Bryant down at the 1-yard line, but overturned the call as an incomplete pass following a challenge from the Packers.[137][138]\n\nRomo led the NFL in completion percentage and passer rating en route to the NFC East title.[139][140][141][142][143] He finished tied for 3rd in MVP voting.[144] He was ranked 34th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[145] He was the highest undrafted player on the year's list.\n\nRomo started strong in the 2015 season, throwing a game-winning pass to Jason Witten with seven seconds left in the Cowboys' season opener against the New York Giants. He passed for 356 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 27\u201326 victory.[146] He continued to show success in a Week 2 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, but suffered a broken left collarbone in the third quarter after being sacked by linebacker Jordan Hicks.[147][148] The injury sidelined Romo for eight weeks,[149] during which the Cowboys failed to win a single game with Brandon Weeden and then Matt Cassel as starting quarterback.[150]\n\nRomo returned to the starting lineup in a Week 11 game against the Miami Dolphins. Despite throwing two interceptions, he completed 18 of 28 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns in a 24\u201314 victory, ending the Cowboys' seven-game losing streak.[151]\n\nThe Cowboys then faced the 10\u20130 Carolina Panthers in a Week 12 Thanksgiving game. Although up against an undefeated team and holding only a 3\u20137 record, the Romo-led Cowboys were favored to win and still had hopes for the playoffs in a weak NFC East division. However, Romo threw three interceptions in the first half, two of which were returned for touchdowns, helping the Panthers take a 23\u20133 lead. At the end of the third quarter, Romo was sacked by linebacker Thomas Davis, reinjuring his left shoulder and ending his season.[152] Romo remained on the active roster until December 21 when he was placed on injured reserve after the Cowboys dropped to 4\u201310, officially ending their playoff hopes.[153]\n\nRomo was unable to start in the 2016 regular season after suffering a compression fracture to the L1 vertebra in his back during the Cowboys' third preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks.[154] The injury caused him to miss the first 10 games of the season, with the duties of the team's starting quarterback being assumed by rookie Dak Prescott.\n\nAlthough Cowboys owner Jerry Jones initially said Romo would remain the team's starter when he returned,[155] Prescott's success with the team and the length of Romo's injury led to Jones reconsidering his decision.[156] Amid Prescott guiding the team to an eight-game winning streak, Romo conceded his role as starting quarterback to Prescott[157] and began serving as the Cowboys' backup when he returned to the active roster in Week 11. Romo made his season debut in the regular season finale on January 1, 2017, against the Philadelphia Eagles. In what would prove to be the final play of his career, he threw a touchdown pass to Terrance Williams before Mark Sanchez played the rest of the game.[158]\n\nOn April 4, 2017, Romo announced his retirement from the NFL. After announcing his retirement, he was released by the Cowboys, per his request.[159] Following his retirement, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban announced that Romo would be a \"Maverick for a day\" for the Mavericks' final home game of their 2016\u201317 season. He warmed up with the team and sat in full uniform on the bench, but did not play in the game and was not considered an official member of the roster.[160]\n\nFollowing his retirement from the NFL, he was hired by CBS Sports to serve as the lead color analyst for the network's NFL telecasts, working in the booth alongside play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz,[159] replacing Phil Simms, who was moved to the studio for The NFL Today.[165][166]\n\nWhile there was no controversy of Romo deciding to retire and move on to broadcasting, some critics questioned Romo being immediately hired for the number one position ahead of broadcasting veterans Dan Fouts, Trent Green, or Rich Gannon, all of whom served in the number 2\u20134 positions, respectively, for CBS, with Fouts having once been the color commentator on Monday Night Football. None of the ex-players and coaches in a lead position on other networks at the time of Romo's hiring (Troy Aikman, Cris Collinsworth, and Jon Gruden) started their broadcasting career in the lead position.[167] Simms jokingly asked Romo \"How does that seat feel?\" during Week 1 of The NFL Today.[168]\n\nOnce the 2017 NFL season got underway, Romo received critical praise for his work as a recent ex-player, most notably for his ability to predict offensive plays and read defensive formations from the booth,[169][170] and \"adding an enthusiasm that had been lacking with Simms.\"[171][172][173][174]\n\nRomo and Nantz received further acclaim for their broadcasting of the 2018 AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the New England Patriots,[175] as \"Nantz continually set Romo up to make his predictions and analysis prior to the snap\", and some suggested that Chiefs head coach \"Andy Reid could have used Romo on his defensive staff, because the former quarterback knew just about every play the Patriots were going to run down the stretch.\"[176] According to The Guardian, the \"beauty of Romo's analysis is that it feels like he's in on the fun with you.\"[177] That season, Romo and Nantz called Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta.[178]\n\nThe New Yorker has called him a \"genius of football commentary.\"[179] Romo has received praise from other prominent sports commentators, including Bob Costas and Dick Vitale.[180]\n\nIn February 2020, Romo renewed his contract with CBS through 2030, with the network reportedly paying him $17 million per year making Romo one of the highest-paid personnel in sports broadcasting and \"the highest-paid NFL analyst in television history.\"[181][182]\n\nRomo began to face increased criticism of his broadcasting ability during the 2021 NFL season.[183] He was criticized for talking too much, telling confusing stories and seeming to be confused during crucial parts of games.[183] The New York Post reported that following the season, CBS staged an intervention believing that Romo's analysis had begun to regress.[184] Multiple CBS executives met with Romo to discuss their concerns that he was not preparing adequately to call games and that his chemistry with Nantz had declined.[184]\n\nCriticism of Romo's broadcasting increased further during Romo's sixth year as the lead play-by-play broadcaster for CBS.[185] According to Front Office Sports, Romo's analysis during the 2022 season was inane, obvious and at times made little sense.[185] He was said to be shouting at viewers, making odd vocalizations and talking too much during the broadcast.[185] Furthermore, his ability to correctly predict plays has become increasingly rare.[185] Some have speculated that Romo being removed from the field for a number of years is responsible for the perceived decline in his broadcasting ability.[185]\n\nIn 2018, Romo filled the vacancy of Jon Gruden in Corona's \"Corona Hotline\" commercials.[186] Romo has maintained his recurring position in the series of advertisements, and many of the television ad spots feature his fantasy football advice.[187]\n\nAs of 2013[update], Romo hosted a youth football camp in Burlington, Wisconsin, annually during the summer, since 2004.[188][189] In the Dallas area, Romo participated in community activities in collaboration with United Way, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.[17]\n\nIn November 2007, Romo began dating American singer and actress Jessica Simpson.[190] On December 16, 2007, Simpson attended a Dallas Cowboys\u2013Philadelphia Eagles game at Texas Stadium, in which Romo had a bad performance in the loss to the Eagles.[191] Controversy erupted before the playoff game against the New York Giants\u2014a game the Cowboys would lose\u2014when pictures surfaced of Romo (along with teammates Jason Witten and Bobby Carpenter) at a resort in Cabo San Lucas with Simpson.[192] On July 13, 2009, People reported that Romo and Simpson broke up on July 9, 2009, the night before her 29th birthday.[193]\n\nOn May 28, 2011, Romo married Candice Crawford, the 2008 Miss Missouri USA, a former journalist for Dallas television station KDAF, and the sister of actor Chace Crawford.[194] They had dated since the summer of 2009, and became engaged on December 16, 2010.[195] The couple have three sons together: Hawkins Crawford Romo (born April 9, 2012),[196] Rivers Romo (born March 18, 2014),[197] and Jones McCoy Romo (born August 23, 2017).[198]\n\nRomo is an avid amateur golfer, and attempted to qualify for the 2004 EDS Byron Nelson Championship and the 2005 U.S. Open, but failed. During the offseason, when not training, he plays golf around Dallas. He failed to make the cut in qualifying for Byron Nelson in 2008.[17] In February 2018, it was announced that he had received a sponsor's exemption to play in the PGA Tour's Corales Puntacana Resort and Club Championship in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic from March 22\u201325.[199] Romo missed the cut with scores of 77 and 82, dead last in the 132-man field after the second round. In July 2018, he won the American Century Championship, a celebrity tournament.[200]\n\nRomo is a Christian and has spoken about his faith saying, \"My faith has grown and I found that always having Jesus makes things a lot easier in my life. Having Jesus in your life gives you everlasting peace, which never goes away. It helps you handle the ups and downs of professional football.\"[201]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo"}, {"id": 3, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/43/855615/original/diego-maradona-football-players-soccer-photo-u18?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Diego Maradona", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/diego-maradona/855615", "desc": "Diego Armando Maradona (30 October 1960 \u2013 25 November 2020) was an Argentine retired professional footballer.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award. \n\nMaradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity and allowed him to manoeuvre better than most other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname \"El Pibe de Oro\" (\"The Golden Boy\"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career. He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.\n\nAn advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee twice: in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for \u00a35\u00a0million, and in 1984 when he moved to Napoli for a fee of \u00a36.9\u00a0million. He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades.\n\nIn his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups, including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2\u20131 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the \"Hand of God\", while the second goal followed a 60\u00a0m (66\u00a0yd) dribble past five England players, voted \"Goal of the Century\" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.\n\nMaradona became the coach of Argentina's national football team in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He then coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011\u201312 season. In 2017, Maradona became the coach of Fujairah before leaving at the end of the season. In May 2018, Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest. He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July. From September 2018 to June 2019, Maradona was coach of Mexican club Dorados. He was the coach of Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Gimnasia de La Plata from September 2019 until his death in November 2020.\n\nDiego Armando Maradona was born on 30 October 1960, at the Policl\u00ednico (Polyclinic) Evita Hospital in Lan\u00fas, Buenos Aires Province, to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province; he was raised in Villa Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina.[3][4] He was the first son after four daughters. He has two younger brothers, Hugo (el Turco) and Ra\u00fal (Lalo), both of whom were also professional football players.[5][6] His father Diego Maradona \"Chitoro\" (1927\u20132015), who worked at a chemicals factory, was of Guaran\u00ed (Indigenous) and Spanish (Basque) descent, and his mother Dalma Salvadora Franco, \"Do\u00f1a Tota\" (1930\u20132011), was of Italian and Croatian descent.[7][8][9][10]\n\nWhen Diego came to Argentinos Juniors for trials, I was really struck by his talent and couldn't believe he was only eight years old. In fact, we asked him for his ID card so we could check it, but he told us he didn't have it on him. We were sure he was having us on because, although he had the physique of a child, he played like an adult. When we discovered he'd been telling us the truth, we decided to devote ourselves purely to him.\nMaradona's parents were both born and brought up in the town of Esquina in the north-east province of Corrientes on the banks of the Corriente River. In the 1950s, they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires.[4] Maradona received his first football as a gift at age three and quickly became devoted to the game.[12] At age eight, he was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his local club Estrella Roja. In March 1969 he was recommended to Los Cebollitas (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires's Argentinos Juniors by his close friend and football rival Gregorio Carrizo who had already been picked by coach Francis Gregorio Cornejo.[13][14] Maradona became a star for the Cebollitas, and as a 12-year-old ball boy he amused spectators by showing his ball skills during the halftime breaks of Argentinos Juniors' first division games.[15] During 1973 and 1974, Maradona led Cebollitas to two Evita Tournament wins and 141 undefeated games in a row, playing alongside players like Adrian Domenech and Claudio Rodr\u00edguez, in what is regarded as the best youth team in the history of Argentine football.[16] Maradona named Brazilian playmaker Rivellino and Manchester United winger George Best among his inspirations growing up.[17][18]\n\nOn 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors, 10 days before his 16th birthday,[19] versus Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba. He entered to the pitch wearing the number 16 jersey, and became the youngest player in the history of the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n. A few minutes into his debut, Maradona kicked the ball through the legs of Juan Domingo Cabrera, a nutmeg that would become symbolic of his talent.[20] After the game, Maradona said, \"That day I felt I had held the sky in my hands.\"[21] Thirty years later, Cabrera remembered Maradona's debut: \"I was on the right side of the field and went to press him, but he didn't give me a chance. He made the nutmeg and when I turned around, he was far away from me\".[22] Maradona scored his first goal in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n against Marplatense team San Lorenzo on 14 November 1976, two weeks after turning 16.[23]\n\nMaradona spent five years at Argentinos Juniors, from 1976 to 1981, scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his US$4\u00a0million transfer to Boca Juniors.[24] Maradona received offers to join other clubs, including River Plate who offered to make him the club's best paid player.[25] However, River decided to drop its bid due to its large payroll in keeping Daniel Passarella and Ubaldo Fillol.[26]\n\nMaradona signed a contract with Boca Juniors on 20 February 1981. He made his debut two days later against Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba, scoring twice in the club's 4\u20131 win. On 10 April, Maradona played his first Supercl\u00e1sico against River Plate at La Bombonera stadium. Boca defeated River 3\u20130 with Maradona scoring a goal after dribbling past Alberto Tarantini and Fillol.[27] Despite the distrustful relationship between Maradona and Boca Juniors manager, Silvio Marzolini,[28] Boca had a successful season, winning the league title after securing a point against Racing Club.[29] That would be the only title won by Maradona in the Argentine domestic league.[30]\n\n\"He had complete mastery of the ball. When Maradona ran with the ball or dribbled through the defence, he seemed to have the ball tied to his boots. I remember our early training sessions with him: the rest of the team were so amazed that they just stood and watched him. We all thought ourselves privileged to be witnesses of his genius.\"\n\n\u2014Barcelona teammate Lobo Carrasco[31]\n\nAfter the 1982 World Cup, in June, Maradona was transferred to Barcelona in Spain for a then world record fee of \u00a35\u00a0million ($7.6\u00a0million).[32] In 1983, under coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey (Spain's annual national cup competition), beating Real Madrid, and the Spanish Super Cup, beating Athletic Bilbao. On 26 June 1983, Barcelona won away to Real Madrid in one of the world's biggest club games, El Cl\u00e1sico, a match where Maradona scored and became the first Barcelona player to be applauded by arch-rival Real Madrid fans.[33] Maradona dribbled past Madrid goalkeeper Agust\u00edn, and as he approached the empty goal, he stopped just as Madrid defender Juan Jos\u00e9 came sliding in an attempt to block the shot. Jos\u00e9 ended up crashing into the post, before Maradona slotted the ball into the net.[34] With the manner in which the goal was scored resulting in applause from opposition fans, only Ronaldinho (in November 2005) and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta (in November 2015) have since been granted such an ovation as Barcelona players from Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.[33][35]\n\nDue to illness and injury as well as controversial incidents on the field, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona.[36] First a bout of hepatitis, then a broken ankle in a La Liga game at the Camp Nou in September 1983 caused by a reckless tackle by Athletic Bilbao's Andoni Goikoetxea\u2014nicknamed \"the Butcher of Bilbao\"\u2014threatened to jeopardize Maradona's career, but with treatment and rehabilitation, it was possible for him to return to the pitch after a three-month recovery period.[19][37]\n\nMaradona was directly involved in a violent and chaotic fight at the 1984 Copa del Rey Final at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u stadium in Madrid against Athletic Bilbao.[38] After receiving another hard tackle by Goikoetxea, as well as being taunted with racist insults related to his father's Native American ancestry throughout the match by Bilbao fans, and being provoked by Bilbao's Miguel Sola at full time after Barcelona lost 1\u20130, Maradona snapped.[38] He aggressively got up, stood inches from Sola's face and the two exchanged words. This started a chain reaction of emotional reactions from both teams. Using expletives, Sola mimicked a gesture from the crowd towards Maradona by using a xenophobic term.[39] Maradona then headbutted Sola, elbowed another Bilbao player in the face and kneed another player in the head, knocking him out cold.[38] The Bilbao squad surrounded Maradona to exact some retribution, with Goikoetxea connecting with a high kick to his chest, before the rest of the Barcelona squad joined in to help Maradona. From this point, Barcelona and Bilbao players brawled on the field with Maradona in the centre of the action, kicking and punching anyone in a Bilbao shirt.[38]\n\nThe mass brawl was played out in front of the Spanish King Juan Carlos and an audience of 100,000 fans inside the stadium, and more than half of Spain watching on television.[40] After fans began throwing solid objects on the field at the players, coaches and even photographers, sixty people were injured, with the incident effectively sealing Maradona's transfer out of the club in what was his last game in a Barcelona shirt.[39] One Barcelona executive stated, \"When I saw those scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I realized we couldn't go any further with him.\"[40] Maradona got into frequent disputes with FC Barcelona executives, particularly club president Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games.[41] Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy's Serie A for another world record fee, \u00a36.9\u00a0million ($10.48\u00a0million).[42]\n\nMaradona arrived in Naples and was presented to the world media as a Napoli player on 5 July 1984, where he was welcomed by 75,000 fans at his presentation at the Stadio San Paolo.[43] Sports writer David Goldblatt commented, \"They [the fans] were convinced that the saviour had arrived.\"[44] A local newspaper stated that despite the lack of a \"mayor, houses, schools, buses, employment and sanitation, none of this matters because we have Maradona\".[44] Prior to Maradona's arrival, Italian football was dominated by teams from the north and centre of the country, such as A.C. Milan, Juventus, Inter Milan, and Roma, and no team in the south of the Italian Peninsula had ever won a league title. This was perhaps the perfect scenario for the Maradona and his working-class-sympathetic image, as he joined a once-great team that was facing relegation at the end of the 1983\u201384 Serie A season, in what was the toughest and most highly regarded football league in Europe.[44][45]\n\nAt Napoli, Maradona reached the peak of his professional career: he soon inherited the captain's armband from Napoli veteran defender Giuseppe Bruscolotti[46] and quickly became an adored star among the club's fans; in his time there he elevated the team to the most successful era in its history.[44] Maradona played for Napoli at a period when north\u2013south tensions in Italy were at a peak due to a variety of issues, notably the economic differences between the two.[44] Led by Maradona, Napoli won their first ever Serie A Italian Championship in 1986\u201387.[44] Goldblatt wrote, \"The celebrations were tumultuous. A rolling series of impromptu street parties and festivities broke out contagiously across the city in a round-the-clock carnival which ran for over a week. The world was turned upside down. The Neapolitans held mock funerals for Juventus and Milan, burning their coffins, their death notices announcing 'May 1987, the other Italy has been defeated. A new empire is born.'\"[44] Murals of Maradona were painted on the city's ancient buildings, and newborn children were named in his honour.[44] The following season, the team's prolific attacking trio, formed by Maradona, Bruno Giordano, and Careca, was later dubbed the \"Ma-Gi-Ca\" (magical) front-line.[47]\n\nNapoli would win their second league title in 1989\u201390, and finish runners up in the league twice, in 1987\u201388 and 1988\u201389.[44] Other honours during the Maradona era at Napoli included the Coppa Italia in 1987 (as well as a second-place finish in the Coppa Italia in 1989), the UEFA Cup in 1989, and the Italian Supercup in 1990.[44] During the 1989 UEFA Cup Final against Stuttgart, Maradona scored from a penalty in a 2\u20131 home victory in the first leg, later assisting Careca's match-winning goal,[48][49] while in the second leg on 17 May\u2014a 3\u20133 away draw\u2014he assisted Ciro Ferrara's goal with a header.[50][51] Despite primarily playing in a creative role as an attacking midfielder, Maradona was the top scorer in Serie A in 1987\u201388 with 15 goals, and was the all-time leading goalscorer for Napoli, with 115 goals,[52] until his record was broken by Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk in 2017.[30][53][54] When asked who was the toughest player he ever faced, A.C. Milan central defender Franco Baresi stated it was Maradona, a view shared by his Milan teammate Paolo Maldini.[55][56]\n\nAlthough Maradona was successful on the field during his time in Italy, his personal problems increased. His cocaine use continued, and he received US$70,000 in fines from his club for missing games and practices, ostensibly because of \"stress\".[57] He faced a scandal there regarding an illegitimate son, and he was also the object of some suspicion over an alleged friendship with the Camorra crime syndicate.[58][59][60][61] He also faced intense backlash and harassment from some local fans after the 1990 World Cup, in which he and Argentina beat Italy in a semi-final match at the San Paolo stadium. In 2000, the number 10 jersey of Napoli was officially retired.[62] On 4 December 2020, nine days after Maradona's death, Napoli's home stadium was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.[63]\n\nAfter serving a 15-month ban for failing a drug test for cocaine, Maradona left Napoli in disgrace in 1992. Despite interest from Real Madrid and Marseille, he signed for Sevilla, where he stayed for one year.[64] In 1993, he played for Newell's Old Boys and in 1995 returned to Boca Juniors for a two-year stint.[19] Maradona also appeared for Tottenham Hotspur in a testimonial match for Osvaldo Ardiles against Internazionale, shortly before the 1986 World Cup.[65] In 1996, he played in a friendly match alongside his brother Raul for Toronto Italia against the Canadian National Soccer League All-Stars.[66] In 2000, he captained Bayern Munich in a friendly against the German national team in the farewell game of Lothar Matth\u00e4us.[67] Maradona was himself given a testimonial match in November 2001, played between an all-star World XI and the Argentina national team.[68]\n\nDuring his time with the Argentina national team, Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances. He made his full international debut at age 16, against Hungary, on 27 February 1977. Maradona was left off the Argentine squad for the 1978 World Cup on home soil by coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti who felt he was too young at age 17.[69] At age 18, Maradona played the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship in Japan and emerged as the star of the tournament, shining in Argentina's 3\u20131 final win over the Soviet Union, scoring a total of six goals in six appearances in the tournament.[70] On 2 June 1979, Maradona scored his first senior international goal in a 3\u20131 win against Scotland at Hampden Park.[71] He went on to play for Argentina in two 1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica ties during August 1979, a 2\u20131 loss against Brazil and a 3\u20130 win over Bolivia in which he scored his side's third goal.[72]\n\nSpeaking thirty years later on the impact of Maradona's performances in 1979, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated, \"Everyone has an opinion on Diego Armando Maradona, and that\u2019s been the case since his playing days. My most vivid recollection is of this incredibly gifted kid at the second FIFA U-20 World Cup in Japan in 1979. He left everyone open-mouthed every time he got on the ball.\"[73] Maradona and his compatriot Lionel Messi are the only players to win the Golden Ball at both the FIFA U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup. Maradona did so in 1979 and 1986, which Messi emulated in 2005 and 2014 (and again in 2022).[74][75]\n\nMaradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence, Spain. Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. Maradona did not perform to expectations,[76] as Argentina, the defending champions, lost 1\u20130. Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and El Salvador in Alicante to progress to the second round, there were internal tensions within the team, with the younger, less experienced players at odds with the older, more experienced players. With a team that also included such players as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles, Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz, Daniel Bertoni, Alberto Tarantini, Ubaldo Fillol, and Daniel Passarella, the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy. The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy beat Argentina at the Sarri\u00e0 Stadium in Barcelona, 2\u20131.[77]\n\nMaradona played in all five matches without being substituted, scoring twice against Hungary. He was fouled repeatedly in all five games and particularly in the last one against Brazil at the Sarri\u00e0, a game that was blighted by poor officiating and violent fouls. With Argentina already down 3\u20130 to Brazil, Maradona's temper eventually got the better of him and he was sent off with five minutes remaining for a serious retaliatory foul against Batista.[78][77]\n\nMaradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, winning the final in Mexico City against West Germany.[79] Throughout the tournament, Maradona asserted his dominance and was the most dynamic player of the competition. He played every minute of every Argentina game, scoring five goals and making five assists; three of the assists came in the opening match against South Korea at the Ol\u00edmpico Universitario Stadium in Mexico City. His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game in Puebla.[80] Argentina eliminated Uruguay in the first knockout round in Puebla, setting up a match against England at the Azteca Stadium, also in Mexico City. \n\nAfter scoring two contrasting goals in the 2\u20131 quarter-final win against England, his legend was cemented.[37] The majesty of his second goal and the notoriety of his first led to the French newspaper L'\u00c9quipe describing Maradona as \"half-angel, half-devil\".[81] This match was played with the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom.[82] Replays showed that the first goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand. Maradona was coyly evasive, describing it as \"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God\".[79] It became known as the \"Hand of God\". Ultimately, on 22 August 2005, Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate. This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history. The goal stood, much to the wrath of the English players.[83]\n\n\"Maradona, turns like a little eel and comes away from trouble, little squat man... comes inside Butcher and leaves him for dead, outside Fenwick and leaves him for dead, and puts the ball away... and that is why Maradona is the greatest player in the world.\"\n\n\u2014Bryon Butler's BBC Radio commentary on Maradona's second goal against England.[84]\n\nMaradona's second goal, just four minutes after the hotly disputed hand-goal, was later voted by FIFA as the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup. He received the ball in his own half, swivelled around and with 11 touches ran more than half the length of the field, dribbling past five English outfield players (Peter Beardsley, Steve Hodge, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, and Terry Fenwick) before he left goalkeeper Peter Shilton on his backside with a feint, and slotted the ball into the net.[85] This goal was voted \"Goal of the Century\" in a 2002 online poll conducted by FIFA.[86] A 2002 Channel 4 poll in the UK saw his performance ranked number 6 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[87]\n\nMaradona followed this with two more goals in a semi-final match against Belgium at the Azteca, including another virtuoso dribbling display for the second goal. In the final match, West Germany attempted to contain him by double-marking him, but in the 84th minute he nevertheless found space past West German player Lothar Matth\u00e4us to give the final pass to Jorge Burruchaga for the winning goal. Argentina beat West Germany 3\u20132 in front of 115,000 fans at the Azteca with Maradona lifting the World Cup as captain.[89]\n\nDuring the tournament, Maradona attempted or created more than half of Argentina's shots, attempted a tournament-best 90 dribbles\u2014three times more than any other player\u2014and was fouled a record 53 times, winning his team twice as many free kicks as any player.[78] Maradona scored or assisted 10 of Argentina's 14 goals (71%), including the assist for the winning goal in the final, ensuring that he would be remembered as one of the greatest names in football history.[78][90] By the end of the World Cup, Maradona went on to win the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament by unanimous vote and was widely regarded to have won the World Cup virtually single-handedly, something that he later stated he did not entirely agree with.[78][91][92][93] Zinedine Zidane, watching the 1986 World Cup as a 14-year-old, stated Maradona \"was on another level\".[94] In a tribute to him, Azteca Stadium authorities built a statue of him scoring the \"Goal of the Century\" and placed it at the entrance of the stadium.[95]\n\nRegarding Maradona's performance at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, in 2014, Roger Bennett of ESPN FC described it as \"the most virtuoso performance a World Cup has ever witnessed,\"[96] while Kevin Baxter of the Los Angeles Times called it \"one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history,\"[97] with Steven Goff of The Washington Post dubbing his performance as \"one of the finest in tournament annals.\"[98] In 2002, Russell Thomas of The Guardian described Maradona's second goal against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals as \"arguably the greatest individual goal ever.\"[99] In a 2009 article for CBC Sports, John Molinaro described the goal as \"the greatest ever scored in the tournament \u2013 and, maybe, in soccer.\"[100] In a 2018 article for Sportsnet, he added: \"No other player, not even Pel[\u00e9] in 1958 nor Paolo Rossi in 1982, had dominated a single competition the way Maradona did in Mexico.\" He also went on to say of Maradona's performance: \"The brilliant Argentine artist single-handedly delivered his country its second World Cup.\" Regarding his two memorable goals against England in the quarter-finals, he commented: \"Yes, it was Maradona\u2019s hand, and not God\u2019s, that was responsible for the first goal against England. But while the 'Hand of God' goal remains one of the most contentious moments in World Cup history, there can be no disputing that his second goal against England ranks as the greatest ever scored in the tournament. It transcended mere sports \u2013 his goal was pure art.\"[101]\n\nMaradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 World Cup in Italy to yet another World Cup final. An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier, and the team were missing three of their best players due to injury. After losing their opening game to Cameroon at the San Siro in Milan, Argentina were almost eliminated in the group stage, only qualifying in third position from their group. In the round of 16 match against Brazil in Turin, Claudio Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona.[102]\n\nIn the quarter-final, Argentina faced Yugoslavia in Florence; the match ended 0\u20130 after 120 minutes, with Argentina advancing in a penalty shootout even though Maradona's kick, a weak shot to the goalkeeper's right, was saved. The semi-final against the host nation Italy at Maradona's club stadium in Naples, the Stadio San Paolo, was also resolved on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw. This time, however, Maradona was successful with his effort, daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his unsuccessful kick in the previous round. At the final in Rome, Argentina lost 1\u20130 to West Germany, the only goal being a controversial penalty scored by Andreas Brehme in the 85th minute, after Rudi V\u00f6ller was adjudged to be fouled.[102]\n\nAt the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Maradona played in only two games (both at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston), scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping.[103] After scoring Argentina's third goal against Greece, Maradona had one of the most remarkable World Cup goal celebrations as he ran towards one of the sideline cameras shouting with a distorted face and bulging eyes, in sheer elation of his return to international football.[104] This turned out to be Maradona's last international goal for Argentina.[105] In the second game, a 2\u20131 victory over Nigeria which was to be his last game for Argentina, he set up both of his team's goals on free kicks, the second an assist to Caniggia, in what were two very strong showings by the Argentine team.[106]\n\nIn his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the energy drink Rip Fuel.[107] His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula.[107] FIFA expelled him from USA '94, and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the round of 16 by Romania in Los Angeles, having been a weaker team without Maradona, even with players like Gabriel Batistuta and Caniggia on the squad.[108] Maradona also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play.[109] His failed drug test at the 1994 World Cup signalled the end of his international career, which lasted 17 years and yielded 34 goals from 91 games, including one winner's medal and one runners-up medal in the World Cup.[110]\n\nAlongside official internationals, Maradona also played and scored for an Argentina XI against the World XI in 1978 to mark the first anniversary of their first World Cup win,[111][112] scored for The Americas against the World in a UNICEF fundraiser a short time after the 1986 triumph,[111][112] a year after that captained the 'Rest of the World' against the English Football League XI to celebrate the organisation's centenary (after reportedly securing a \u00a3100,000 appearance fee)[113][114] and was on the scoresheet for the Argentina XI once more in his own 'farewell match' in 2001.[115]\n\nDescribed as a \"classic number 10\" in the media,[116] Maradona was a traditional playmaker who usually played in a free role, either as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, or as a second striker in a front\u2013two,[117][118][119] although he was also deployed as an offensive\u2013minded central midfielder in a 4\u20134\u20132 formation on occasion.[120][121][122][123] A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname \"El Pibe de Oro\" (\"The Golden Boy\"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.[124] He was renowned for his dribbling ability, vision, close ball control, passing, and creativity, and is considered to have been one of the most skilful players in the sport.[93][125][126] He had a compact physique, and with his strong legs, low center of gravity, and resulting balance, he could withstand physical pressure well while running with the ball, despite his small stature,[96][127][128] while his acceleration, quick feet, and agility, combined with his dribbling skills and close control at speed, allowed him to change direction quickly, making him difficult for opponents to defend against.[129][130][131][132]\n\nOn his dribbling ability, former Dutch player Johan Cruyff saw similarities between Maradona and Lionel Messi with the ball seemingly attached to their boot.[133][134][135] His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup. Although he was known for his penchant for undertaking individual runs with the ball,[136] he was also a strategist and an intelligent team player, with excellent spatial awareness, as well as being highly technical with the ball. He was effective in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second goal against England in 1986),[137][138][139][140] or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot. He showed leadership qualities on the field and captained Argentina in their World Cup campaigns of 1986, 1990, and 1994.[141][142] While he was primarily a creative playmaker, Maradona was also known for his finishing and goalscoring ability.[93][143] Former Milan manager Arrigo Sacchi also praised Maradona for his defensive work-rate off the ball in a 2010 interview with Il Corriere dello Sport.[144]\n\nThe team leader on and off the field \u2013 he would speak up on a range of issues on behalf of the players \u2013 Maradona's ability as a player and his overpowering personality had a major positive effect on his team, with his 1986 World Cup teammate Jorge Valdano stating:\n\nMaradona was a technical leader: a guy who resolved all difficulties that may come up on the pitch. Firstly, he was in charge of making the miracles happen, that's something that gives team-mates a lot of confidence. Secondly, the scope of his celebrity was such that he absorbed all the pressures on behalf of his team-mates. What I mean is: one slept soundly the night before a game not just because you knew you were playing next to Diego and Diego did things no other player in the world could do, but also because unconsciously we knew that if it was the case that we lost then Maradona would shoulder more of the burden, would be blamed more, than the rest of us. That was the kind of influence he exercised on the team.[145]\n Lauding the \"charisma\" of Maradona, another of his Argentina teammates, prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta, stated, \"Diego could command a stadium, have everyone watch him. I played with him and I can tell you how technically decisive he was for the team\".[146] Napoli's former president \u2013 Corrado Ferlaino \u2013 commented on Maradona's leadership qualities during his time with the club in 2008, describing him as \"a coach on the pitch.\"[147]\n\n\"Even if I played for a million years, I'd never come close to Maradona. Not that I'd want to anyway. He's the greatest there's ever been.\"\n\n\u2014Lionel Messi, the player most closely identified with the \"New Maradona\" label.[73]\n\nOne of Maradona's trademark moves was dribbling full-speed on the right wing, and on reaching the opponent's goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the rabona, a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight.[148] This manoeuvre led to several assists, such as the cross for Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz's header against Switzerland in 1980.[149] Moreover, he was also a well\u2013known proponent of the roulette, a feint which involved him dragging the ball back first with one foot and then the other, while simultaneously performing a 360\u00b0 turn; due to his penchant for using this move, it has even occasionally been described as the \"Maradona turn\" in the media.[150] He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker, who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball from corners and direct set pieces.[151][152][153] Regarded as one of the best dead-ball specialists of all time,[154][155][156][157] his free kick technique, which often saw him raise his knee at a high angle when striking the ball, thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall, allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 22 to 17 yards (20 to 16 metres) from the goal, or even just outside the penalty area.[158] His style of taking free kicks influenced several other specialists, including Gianfranco Zola,[156] Andrea Pirlo,[159] and Lionel Messi.[160]\n\nMaradona was famous for his cunning personality.[161] Some critics view his controversial \"Hand of God\" goal at the 1986 World Cup as a clever manoeuvre, with one of the opposition players, Glenn Hoddle, admitting that Maradona had disguised it by flicking his head at the same time as palming the ball.[162] The goal itself has been viewed as an embodiment of the Buenos Aires shanty town Maradona was brought up in and its concept of viveza criolla\u2014\"cunning of the criollos\".[163] Although critical of the illegitimate first goal, England striker Gary Lineker conceded, \"When Diego scored that second goal against us, I felt like applauding. It was impossible to score such a beautiful goal. He's the greatest player of all time, by a long way. A genuine phenomenon.\"[11] Maradona used his hand in the 1990 World Cup, again without punishment, and this time on his own goal line, to prevent the Soviet Union from scoring.[164] A number of publications have referred to Maradona as the Artful Dodger, the urchin pickpocket from Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist.[165][166][167][168]\n\nMaradona was dominantly left-footed, often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a right-footed connection.[169] His first goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-final is a worthy indicator of such; he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot, requiring more technical ability. During his run past several England players in the previous round for the \"Goal of the Century\" he did not use his right foot once, despite spending the whole movement on the right-hand side of the pitch. In the 1990 World Cup second-round tie against Brazil, he used his right foot to set up the winning goal for Claudio Caniggia due to two Brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical.[170]\n\nPel\u00e9 scored more goals. Lionel Messi has won more trophies. Both have lived more stable lives than the overweight former cocaine addict who tops this list, whose relationship with football became increasingly strained the longer his career continued. If you've seen Diego Maradona with a football at his feet, you'll understand.\nMaradona is widely regarded as the best player of his generation.[138] He is considered one of the greatest players of all time by pundits, players, and managers,[73][172][173] and by some as the best player ever.[171][174][175][176] Known as one of the most skillful players in the game, he is regarded as one of the greatest dribblers[96][127][134][135] and free kick takers in history.[154][155][156][157] A precocious talent in his youth,[124] in addition to his playing ability, Maradona also drew praise from his former manager Menotti for his dedication, determination, and the work-ethic he demonstrated in order to improve the technical aspect of his game in training, despite his natural gifts, with the manager noting: \"I'm always cautious about using the word 'genius'. I find it hard to apply that even to Mozart. The beauty of Diego's game has a hereditary element \u2013 his natural ease with the ball \u2013 but it also owes a lot to his ability to learn: a lot of those brushstrokes, those strokes of 'genius', are in fact a product of his hard work. Diego worked very hard to be the best.\"[177] Maradona's former Napoli manager \u2013 Ottavio Bianchi \u2013 also praised his discipline in training, commenting: \"Diego is different to the one that they depict. When you got him on his own he was a very good kid. It was beautiful to watch him and coach him. They all speak of the fact that he did not train, but it was not true because Diego was the last person to leave the pitch, it was necessary to send him away because otherwise he would stay for hours to invent free kicks.\"[178] However, although, as Bianchi noted, Maradona was known for making \"great plays\" and doing \"unimaginable\" and \"incredible things\" with the ball during training sessions,[179][180][181] and would even go through periods of rigorous exercise, he was equally known for his limited work-rate in training without the ball, and even gained a degree of infamy during his time in Italy for missing training sessions with Napoli, while he often trained independently instead of with his team.[179][182][183][184]\n\nIn a 2019 documentary film on his life, Diego Maradona, Maradona confessed that his weekly regime consisted of \"playing a game on Sunday, going out until Wednesday, then hitting the gym on Thursday.\" Regarding his inconsistent training regimen, the film's director, Asif Kapadia, commented in 2020: \"He had a metabolism. He would look so incredibly out of shape, but then he\u2019d train like crazy and sweat it off by the time matchday came along. His body shape just didn\u2019t look like a footballer, but then he had this ability and this balance. He had a way of being, and that idea of talking to him honestly about how a typical week transpired was pretty amazing.\" He also revealed that Maradona was ahead of his time in the fact that he had a personal fitness coach \u2013 Fernando Signorini \u2013 who trained him in a variety of areas, in addition to looking after his physical conditioning, adding: \"While he [Maradona] was in a football team he had his own regime. How many players would do that? How many players would even know to think like that? 'I\u2019m different to anyone else so I need to train at what I\u2019m good at and what I\u2019m weak at.' Signorini is very well read and very intelligent. He would literally say, 'This is the way I\u2019m going to train you, read this book.' He would help him psychologically, talk to him about philosophy, and things like that.\"[185][186] Moreover, Maradona was notorious for his poor diet and extreme lifestyle off the pitch, including his use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse, which along with personal issues, his metabolism, medication that he was prescribed, and periods of inactivity due to injuries and suspensions, led to his significant weight\u2013gain and physical decline as his career progressed; his lack of discipline and difficulties in his turbulent personal life are thought by some in the sport to have negatively impacted his performances and longevity in the later years of his playing career.[177][187][188]\n\nA controversial figure in the sport, while he earned critical acclaim from players, pundits, and managers over his playing style, he also drew criticism in the media for his temper and confrontational behaviour, both on and off the pitch.[189][190][191] However, in 2005, Paolo Maldini, described Maradona both as the greatest player he ever faced, and also as the most honest, stating: \"He was a model of good behaviour on the pitch \u2013 he was respectful of everyone, from the great players down to the ordinary team member. He was always getting kicked around and he never complained \u2013 not like some of today's strikers.\"[192] Franco Baresi stated when he was asked who was his greatest opponent: \"Maradona; when he was on form, there was almost no way of stopping him,\"[55] while fellow former Italy defender Giuseppe Bergomi described Maradona as the greatest player of all time in 2018.[193] Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 said that his off-field antics did not matter, and that he should only be judged for the impact he made on the field. \"For me Maradona is more than football. What he did as a footballer, in my opinion, he will be remembered forever. When you see number 10 who do you think about? Maradona. It is a symbol, even today there are those who choose that number for him.\"[194]\n\nToday his skills would afford him greater protection. Back then they merely served as the red rag of provocation that would guarantee he would be the victim of brutal challenges wherever he played. The rules changed as a direct result of some of the injuries Maradona received. When I interviewed him a few years ago, he told me he thought players such as Lionel Messi owed him a great deal because some of the tackles he had endured would never be allowed today.\nIn 1999, Maradona was placed second behind Pel\u00e9 by World Soccer in the magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Players of the 20th Century\".[195] Along with Pel\u00e9, Maradona was one of the two joint winners of the \"FIFA Player of the Century\" award in 2000,[196][172]  and also placed fifth in \"IFFHS' Century Elections\".[197] In a 2014 FIFA poll, Maradona was voted the second-greatest number 10 of all-time, behind only Pel\u00e9,[198] and later that year, was ranked second in The Guardian's list of the 100 greatest World Cup players of all-time, ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, once again behind Pel\u00e9.[199] In 2017, FourFourTwo ranked him in first place in their list of \"100 greatest players\",[171] while in 2018 he was ranked in first place by the same magazine in their list of the \"Greatest Football Players in World Cup History\";[200] in March 2020, he was also ranked first by Jack Gallagher of 90min.com in their list of \"Top 50 Greatest Players of All Time\".[201] In May 2020, Sky Sports ranked Maradona as the best player never to have won the UEFA Champions League/European Cup.[202]\n\nHounded for years by the press, Maradona once fired a compressed-air rifle at reporters whom he claimed were invading his privacy.[203][204] This quote from former teammate Jorge Valdano summarizes the feelings of many:\n\nHe is someone many people want to emulate, a controversial figure, loved, hated, who stirs great upheaval, especially in Argentina... Stressing his personal life is a mistake. Maradona has no peers inside the pitch, but he has turned his life into a show, and is now living a personal ordeal that should not be imitated.[205]\nIn 1990, the Konex Foundation from Argentina granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious culture awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in Sports in the last decade in his country.[206]\n\nIn April 1996, Maradona had a three-round exhibition boxing match with Santos Laciar for charity.[207] In 2000, Maradona published his autobiography Yo Soy El Diego (\"I am The Diego\"), which became a bestseller in Argentina.[208] Two years later, Maradona donated the Cuban royalties of his book to \"the Cuban people and Fidel\".[209]\n\nIn 2000, he won FIFA Player of the Century award which was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet-based poll, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pel\u00e9.[210] In spite of this, and shortly before the ceremony, FIFA added a second award and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists that also gave to Pel\u00e9 the title of best player of the century to make it a draw. Maradona also came fifth in the vote of the IFFHS (International Federation of Football History and Statistics).[197] In 2001, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) asked FIFA for authorization to retire the jersey number 10 for Maradona. FIFA did not grant the request, even though Argentine officials have maintained that FIFA hinted that it would.[211]\n\nMaradona has topped a number of fan polls, including a 2002 FIFA poll in which his second goal against England was chosen as the best goal ever scored in a World Cup; he also won the most votes in a poll to determine the All-Time Ultimate World Cup Team. On 22 March 2010, Maradona was chosen number 1 in 'The Greatest 10 World Cup Players of All Time' by the London-based newspaper The Times.[212] Argentinos Juniors named its stadium after Maradona on 26 December 2003. In 2003, Maradona was employed by the Libyan footballer Al-Saadi Gaddafi, the third son of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, as a \"technical consultant\", while Al-Saadi was playing for the Italian club, Perugia, which was playing in Serie A at the time.[213]\n\nOn 22 June 2005, it was announced that Maradona would return to former club Boca Juniors as a sports vice-president in charge of managing the First Division roster (after a disappointing 2004\u201305 season, which coincided with Boca's centenary).[215][216] His contract began 1 August 2005, and one of his first recommendations proved to be very effective: advising the club to hire Alfio Basile as the new coach.[217] With Maradona fostering a close relationship with the players, Boca won the 2005 Apertura, the 2006 Clausura, the 2005 Copa Sudamericana, and the 2005 Recopa Sudamericana.\n\nOn 15 August 2005, Maradona made his debut as host of a talk-variety show on Argentine television, La Noche del 10 (\"The Night of the no. 10\"). His main guest on opening night was Pel\u00e9; the two had a friendly chat, showing no signs of past differences.[218] However, the show also included a cartoon villain with a clear physical resemblance to Pel\u00e9. In subsequent evenings, he led the ratings on all occasions but one. Most guests were drawn from the worlds of football and show business, including Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, but also included interviews with other notable friends and personalities such as Cuban leader Fidel Castro and boxers Roberto Dur\u00e1n and Mike Tyson.[219] Maradona gave each of his guests a signed Argentina jersey, which Tyson wore when he arrived in Brazil, Argentina's biggest rivals.[220] In November 2005, however, Maradona rejected an offer to work with Argentina's national football team.[221]\n\nIn May 2006, Maradona agreed to take part in UK's Soccer Aid (a program to raise money for UNICEF).[222] In September 2006, Maradona, in his famous blue and white number 10, was the captain for Argentina in a three-day World Cup of Indoor Football tournament in Spain. On 26 August 2006, it was announced that Maradona was quitting his position in the club Boca Juniors because of disagreements with the AFA, who selected Alfio Basile to be the new coach of the Argentina national team.[223] In 2008, Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica made Maradona, a documentary about Maradona's life.[224]\n\nOn 1 September 2014, Maradona, along with many current and former footballing stars, took part in the \"Match for Peace\", which was played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with the proceeds being donated entirely to charity.[225] Maradona set up a goal for Roberto Baggio during the first half of the match, with a chipped through-ball over the defence with the outside of his left foot.[226] Unusually, both Baggio and Maradona wore the number 10 shirt, despite playing on the same team.[226] On 17 August 2015, Maradona visited Ali Bin Nasser, the Tunisian referee of the Argentina\u2013England quarter-final match at the 1986 World Cup where Maradona scored his Hand of God, and paid tribute to him by giving him a signed Argentine jersey.[227][228]\n\nMaradona began his managerial career alongside former Argentinos Juniors midfield teammate Carlos Fren. The pair led Mandiy\u00fa of Corrientes in 1994 and Racing Club in 1995, with little success.[161][229] In May 2011 he became manager of Dubai club Al Wasl FC in the United Arab Emirates.[230][231]\nMaradona was sacked on 10 July 2012.[232][233][234] In August 2013, Maradona moved on to become 'spiritual coach' at Argentine club Deportivo Riestra.[235] Maradona departed this role in 2017 to become the head coach of Fujairah, in the UAE second division, before leaving at the end of the season upon failure to secure promotion at the club.[236][237] In May 2018, Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest.[238] He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July.[239] In September 2018, he was appointed manager of Mexican second division side Dorados.[240] He made his debut with Dorados on 17 September with a 4\u20131 victory over Cafetaleros de Tapachula.[241] On 13 June 2019, after Dorados failed to clinch promotion to the Mexican top flight, Maradona's lawyer announced that he would be stepping down from the role, citing health reasons.[242]\n\nOn 5 September 2019, Maradona was unveiled as the new head coach of Gimnasia de La Plata, signing a contract until the end of the season.[243] After two months in charge he left the club on 19 November.[244] However, two days later, Maradona rejoined the club as manager saying that \"we finally achieved political unity in the club\".[245] Maradona insisted that Gabriel Pellegrino remain club president if he were to stay with Gimnasia de La Plata.[246][247] However it was still not clear if Pellegrino, who declined to run for re-election,[246][247] would stay on as club President.[246][247] Originally scheduled to be held on 23 November,[246] the election was delayed 15 days.[247] On 15 December, Pellegrino, who was encouraged by Maradona to seek re-election, was re-elected to a three-year term.[248] Despite having a bad record during the 2019\u201320 season, Gimnasia renewed Maradona's contract on 3 June 2020 for the 2020\u201321 season.[249] In November 2020, Maradona died in post. His coaching staff resigned from the club following his death.[250]\n\nAfter the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role.[251] According to several press sources, his major challengers included; Diego Simeone, Carlos Bianchi, Miguel \u00c1ngel Russo, and Sergio Batista.[252] On 29 October 2008, AFA chairman Julio Grondona confirmed that Maradona would be the head coach of the national team.[253] On 19 November, Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when they played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow, which Argentina won 1\u20130.[254]\n\nAfter winning his first three matches as the coach of the national team, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to Bolivia, equalling the team's worst ever margin of defeat.[255][256] With two matches remaining in the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup, Argentina was in fifth place and faced the possibility of failing to qualify, but victory in the last two matches secured qualification for the finals.[257][258] After Argentina's qualification, Maradona used abusive language at the live post-game press conference, telling members of the media to \"suck it and keep on sucking it\".[259] FIFA responded with a two-month ban on all footballing activity, which expired on 15 January 2010, and a CHF 25,000 fine, with a warning as to his future conduct.[260] The friendly match scheduled to take place at home to the Czech Republic on 15 December, during the period of the ban, was cancelled. The only match Argentina played during Maradona's ban was a friendly away to Catalonia, which they lost 4\u20132.[261]\n\nAt the World Cup finals in June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1\u20130 against Nigeria, followed by a 4\u20131 victory over South Korea on the strength of a Gonzalo Higua\u00edn hat-trick.[262][263] In the final match of the group stage, Argentina won 2\u20130 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round, meeting Mexico.[264] After defeating Mexico 3\u20131, however, Argentina was routed by Germany 4\u20130 in the quarter-finals to go out of the competition.[265] Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament.[266] After the defeat to Germany, Maradona admitted that he was reconsidering his future as Argentina's coach, stating, \"I may leave tomorrow.\"[267] On 15 July, the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil staged the World Cup.[268] On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract.[269] Afterwards, on 29 July, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams (as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach) Carlos Bilardo had \"lied to\", \"betrayed\", and effectively sacked him from the role. He said, \"They wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he told me that, it meant he did not want me to keep working.\"[270]\n\nBorn to a Roman Catholic family, his parents were Diego Maradona Senior and Dalma Salvadora Franco. Maradona married long-time fianc\u00e9e Claudia Villafa\u00f1e on 7 November 1989 in Buenos Aires,[271] and they had two daughters,  Dalma Nerea (born 2 April 1987) and Gianinna Dinorah (born 16 May 1989), by whom he became a grandfather in 2009 after she married Sergio Ag\u00fcero (now divorced).[272]\n\nMaradona and Villafa\u00f1e divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all as her parents remained on friendly terms. They travelled together to Naples for a series of homages in June 2005 and were seen together on other occasions, including the Argentina games during 2006 World Cup.[273] During the divorce proceedings, Maradona admitted that he was the father of Diego Sinagra (born in Naples on 20 September 1986). The Italian courts had already ruled so in 1993, after Maradona refused to undergo DNA tests to prove or disprove his paternity. Diego Junior met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Italy where Maradona was playing.[274] Sinagra is now a footballer playing in Italy.[275]\n\nAfter the divorce, Claudia embarked on a career as a theatre producer, and Dalma sought an acting career; she previously had expressed her desire to attend the Actors Studio West in Los Angeles.[276][277]\n\nMaradona's relationship with his immediate family was a close one. In a 1990 interview with Sports Illustrated he showed phone bills where he had spent a minimum of $15,000 US per month calling his parents and siblings.[278] Maradona's mother, Dalma, died on 19 November 2011. He was in Dubai at the time, and desperately tried to fly back in time to see her, but was too late. She was 81 years old. His father, \"Don\" Diego, died on 25 June 2015 at age 87.[279]\n\nIn 2014, Maradona was accused of assaulting his girlfriend, Roc\u00edo Oliva, allegations which he denied.[280][281] In 2017, he gifted her a house in Bella Vista, but in December 2018 they split up.[282] Maradona's great-nephew Hern\u00e1n L\u00f3pez is also a professional footballer.[283]\n\nFrom the mid-1980s until 2004, Maradona was addicted to cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983.[285] By the time he was playing for Napoli, he had a full-blown addiction, which interfered with his ability to play football.[286] In the midst of his drug crisis in 1991, Maradona was asked by journalists if the hit song \"Mi enfermedad\" (lit. \"My Disease\") was dedicated to him.[287] Maradona was banned from football in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.[288]\n\nMaradona had a tendency to put on weight and suffered increasingly from obesity, at one point weighing 280\u00a0lb (130\u00a0kg). He was obese from the end of his playing career until undergoing gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 6 March 2005. His surgeon said that Maradona would follow a liquid diet for three months in order to return to his normal weight.[289] When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter, he displayed a notably thinner figure.[290]\n\nOn 29 March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires. He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse and was released on 11 April, but readmitted two days later.[291] In the following days, there were constant rumours about his health, including three false claims of his death within a month.[292] After being transferred to a psychiatric clinic specializing in alcohol-related problems, Maradona was discharged on 7 May.[293] On 8 May, Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had quit drinking and had not used drugs in two and a half years.[294] During the 2018 World Cup match between Argentina and Nigeria, Maradona was shown on television cameras behaving extremely erratically, with an abundance of white residue visible on the glass in front of his seat in the stands. The smudges could have been fingerprints, and he later blamed his behaviour on consuming lots of wine.[295]  In January 2019, Maradona underwent surgery after a hernia caused internal bleeding in his stomach.[296]\n\nMaradona was idelogically left-wing.[297] He supported the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and condemned Israel's military strikes in the Gaza Strip during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, saying: \"What Israel is doing to the Palestinians is shameful.\"[298] He became friends with Cuban president Fidel Castro while receiving treatment on the island, with Castro stating, \"Diego is a great friend and very noble, too. There's also no question he\u2019s a wonderful athlete and has maintained a friendship with Cuba to no material gain of his own.\"[73] Maradona had a portrait of Castro tattooed on his left leg and one of Fidel's second in command, fellow Argentine Che Guevara on his right arm.[299] In his autobiography, El Diego, he dedicated the book to various people, including Castro. He wrote, \"To Fidel Castro and, through him, all the Cuban people.\"[300]\n\nMaradona voiced support for Bolivia's president Evo Morales[301] and was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In 2005, he came to Venezuela to meet Ch\u00e1vez, who received him in the presidential Miraflores Palace. After the meeting, Maradona said that he had come to meet a \"great man\" (un grande, which can also mean \"a big man\", in Spanish), but had instead met a gigantic man (un gigante). He also stated, \"I believe in Ch\u00e1vez, I am a Chavista. Everything Fidel does, everything Ch\u00e1vez does, for me is the best.\"[302] Maradona was Ch\u00e1vez's guest of honour at the opening game of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica held in Venezuela.[303]\n\nMany sportsmen claim to be champions of the people, but Maradona's populism is underwritten by his itinerary \u2014 the proletarian strongholds of Buenos Aires, Naples, and now Havana.\nIn 2004, Maradona participated in a protest against the U.S.-led war in Iraq.[297] Maradona declared his opposition to what he identified as imperialism, particularly during the 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. There he protested George W. Bush's presence in Argentina, wearing a T-shirt labelled \"STOP BUSH\" (with the \"s\" in \"Bush\" being replaced with a swastika) and referring to Bush as \"human garbage\".[305][306] In August 2007, Maradona went further, making an appearance on Ch\u00e1vez's weekly television show Al\u00f3 Presidente and saying, \"I hate everything that comes from the United States. I hate it with all my strength.\"[307] By December 2008, however, Maradona had adopted a more pro-U.S. attitude and expressed admiration for Bush's successor, then-President-elect Barack Obama, for whom he had great expectations.[214]\n\n\"I asked myself, 'Who is this man? Who is this footballing magician, this Sex Pistol of international football, this cocaine victim who kicked the habit, looked like Falstaff and was as weak as spaghetti?' If Andy Warhol had still been alive, he would have definitely put Maradona alongside Marilyn Monroe and Mao Tse-tung. I'm convinced that if he hadn\u2019t been a footballer, he'd've become a revolutionary.\"\n\n\u2014Emir Kusturica, film director[73]\n\nWith his poor shanty town (villa miseria) upbringing, Maradona cultivated a man-of-the-people persona.[308] During a meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1987, they clashed on the issue of wealth disparity, with Maradona stating, \"I argued with him because I was in the Vatican and I saw all these golden ceilings and afterwards I heard the Pope say the Church was worried about the welfare of poor kids. Sell your ceiling then, amigo, do something!\"[308] In September 2014, Maradona met with Pope Francis in Rome, crediting Francis for inspiring him to return to religion after many years away; he stated, \"We should all imitate Pope Francis. If each one of us gives something to someone else, no one in the world would be starving.\"[309]\n\nIn December 2007, Maradona presented a signed shirt with a message of support to the people of Iran: it is displayed in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' museum.[310] In April 2013, Maradona visited the tomb of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and urged Venezuelans to elect the late leader's designated successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, to continue the socialist leader's legacy; \"Continue the struggle,\" Maradona said on television.[311] Maradona attended Maduro's final campaign rally in Caracas, signing footballs and kicking them to the crowd, and presented Maduro with an Argentina jersey.[311] Having visited Ch\u00e1vez's tomb with Maradona, Maduro said, \"Speaking with Diego was very emotional because comandante Ch\u00e1vez also loved him very much.\"[311] Maradona participated and danced at the electoral campaign rally during the 2018 presidential elections in Venezuela.[312][313] During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, the Mexican Football Federation fined him for violating their code of ethics and dedicating a team victory to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.[314]\n\nMaradona in his 2000 autobiography Yo Soy El Diego, linked the \"Hand of God\" goal against England at the 1986 World Cup to the Falklands War: \"Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas [Falklands] War, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge.\"[315] In October 2015, Maradona thanked Queen Elizabeth II and the Houses of Parliament in London for giving him the chance to provide \"true justice\" as head of an organization designed to help young children.[316] In a video released on his official Facebook page, Maradona confirmed he would accept their nomination for him to become Latin American director for the non-governmental organization Football for Unity.[316]\n\nIn March 2009, Italian officials announced that Maradona still owed the Italian government \u20ac37\u00a0million in local taxes, \u20ac23.5\u00a0million of which was accrued interest on his original debt. They reported that at that point, Maradona had paid only \u20ac42,000, two luxury watches and a set of earrings.[317][318]\n\nOn 2 November 2020, Maradona was admitted to a hospital in La Plata, supposedly for psychological reasons. A representative of the ex-footballer said his condition was not serious.[319] A day later, he underwent emergency brain surgery to treat a subdural hematoma.[320] He was released on 12 November after successful surgery and was supervised by doctors as an outpatient.[321] On 25 November, at the age of 60, Maradona suffered cardiac arrest and died in his sleep at his home in Dique Luj\u00e1n, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.[322][323] Maradona's coffin \u2013 draped in Argentina's national flag and three Maradona number 10 shirts (Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors and Argentina) \u2013 lay in state at the Presidential Palace, the Casa Rosada, with mourners filing past his coffin.[324] On 26 November, Maradona's wake, which was attended by tens of thousands of people, was cut short by his family as his coffin was relocated from the rotunda of the Presidential Palace after fans took over an inner courtyard and also clashed with police.[325][326] The same day, a private funeral service was held and Maradona was buried next to his parents at the Jard\u00edn de Bella Vista cemetery in Bella Vista, Buenos Aires.[327]\n\n\"I have lost a great friend and the world has lost a legend. There's still so much to be said, but for now, may God give strength to his relatives. One day I hope we can play football together in heaven.\"\n\n\u2014 Pel\u00e9 paying tribute following Maradona's death[328]\n\nIn a statement on social media, the Argentine Football Association expressed \"its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend\", adding: \"You will always be in our hearts.\"[329] President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez announced three days of national mourning.[330] UEFA and CONMEBOL announced that every match in the Champions League, Europa League, Copa Libertadores, and Copa Sudamericana would hold a moment of silence prior to kickoff.[331][332] Boca Juniors' game was postponed in respect to Maradona.[333] Subsequently, other confederations around the world followed suit, with every fixture observing a minute of silence, starting with the 2020 AFC Champions League's fixtures.[334] In addition to the minute of silence in Serie A, an image of Maradona was projected on stadium screens in the 10th minute of play.[335]\n\nIn Naples, the Stadio San Paolo\u2014officially renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on 4 December 2020\u2014was illuminated at night in honour of Maradona, with numerous fans gathering outside the stadium placing murals and paintings as a tribute. Both Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and the mayor of Naples Luigi de Magistris expressed their desire to rename their stadium after Maradona, which was unanimously approved by Naples City Council.[63] Prior to Napoli's Europa League match against Rijeka the day after Maradona's death, all of the Napoli players wore shirts with \"Maradona 10\" on the back of them, before observing a minute of silence.[336] Figures in the sport from every continent around the world also paid tribute to him.[328][337][338] Celebrities and other sports people outside football also paid tribute to Maradona.[339][340][341][342][343]\n\nOn 27 November 2020, the Aditya School of Sports in Barasat, Kolkata, India named their cricket stadium after Maradona.[344] Three years earlier Maradona had conducted a workshop with 100 kids in the stadium and played a charity match at the same venue with former Indian cricket captain, Sourav Ganguly.[344] The AFA announced that the 2020 Copa de la Liga Profesional, which is the debut season of Copa de la Liga Profesional, would be renamed Copa Diego Armando Maradona.[345] On 28 November, Pakistan Football Federation's main cup PFF National Challenge Cup honoured Maradona along with Wali Mohammad.[346][347] In a rugby union test match between Argentina and New Zealand on 28 November, as the New Zealand team lined up to perform the haka their captain Sam Cane presented a black jersey with Maradona's name and his number 10.[348][349] On 29 November, compatriot Lionel Messi scored in Barcelona's 4\u20130 home win over Osasuna in La Liga, dedicating his goal to Maradona by revealing a Newell's Old Boys shirt worn by the latter under his own, and subsequently pointing to the sky.[350]\n\nOn 30 November, after Boca Juniors opened the scoring against Newell's Old Boys at La Bombonera, the club's players paid an emotional tribute by laying a Maradona jersey in front of his private suite where his daughter Dalma was present.[351]\n\nIn May 2021, seven medical professionals were charged with homicide over Maradona's death, in violation of their duties, and could face between 8 and 25 years in prison if convicted.[352] On 25 June, psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov was summoned by the Prosecution Office of San Isidro and faced a formal questioning, where she agreed to answer more than 100 queries regarding the medical treatment given to Maradona in that medical field.[353][354] After seven hours of questioning, Cosachov's lawyer Vadim Mischanchuk addressed the press and denied that Cosachov's prescription medication could have worsened Maradona's heart condition, and Cosachov further denied any responsibility in the death.[355] On 28 June, multiple arrest warrants were requested by a plaintiff lawyer against Cosachov, personal doctor Leopoldo Luque, psychologist Carlos D\u00edaz, and doctor Nancy Forlini in direct connection with Maradona's alleged negligent death.[356] On 1 July, the prosecutors in the case refused to ask a judge to issue arrest warrants against all the aforementioned professionals, on the basis that they considered the request had been a media stunt (\"incursi\u00f3n medi\u00e1tica\") for the case, coinciding with personal doctor Luque's interrogation.[357][358]\n\nIn June 2022, a judge ruled that eight medical personnel should face trial for criminal negligence and homicide in regards to Maradona's death.[359][360][361]\n\n\nIn Argentina, Maradona is considered an icon. Concerning the idolatry that exists in his country, former teammate Jorge Valdano said: \n\"At the time that Maradona retired from active football, he left Argentina traumatized. Maradona was more than just a great footballer. He was a special compensation factor for a country that in a few years lived through several military dictatorships and social frustrations of all kinds. Maradona offered to Argentines a way out of their collective frustration, and that's why people there love him as a divine figure.\"[363]\n In leading his nation to the 1986 World Cup, and in particular his performance and two goals in the quarter-final against England, Guillem Balagu\u00e9 writes: \"That Sunday in Mexico City, the world saw one man single-handedly \u2013 in more than one sense of the phrase \u2013 lift the mood of a depressed and downtrodden nation into the stratosphere. With two goals in the space of four minutes, he allowed them to dare to dream that they, like him, could be the best in the world. He did it first by nefarious and then spellbindingly brilliant means. In those moments, he went from star player to legend.\"[37]\n\nSince 1986, it has been common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona's name as a token of recognition, even in remote places.[36] The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England.[364] In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends. In the Argentine film El hijo de la novia (\"Son of the Bride\"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron, \"They idolized him and then crucified him.\" When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts, \"But I was talking about Maradona.\" He is the subject of the film El camino de San Diego, though he himself only appears in archive footage.[365]\n\nMaradona was included in many cameos in the Argentine comic book El Cazador de Aventuras. After the closing of it, the authors started a new short-lived comic book titled El Die, using Maradona as the main character. Maradona has had several online Flash games that are entirely dedicated to his legacy.[366] In Rosario, Argentina, locals organized the parody religion of the \"Church of Maradona\". The organization reformulates many elements from Christian tradition, such as Christmas or prayers, reflecting instead details from Maradona. It had 200 founding members, and tens of thousands more have become members via the church's official web site.[367]\n\nMany Argentine artists performed songs in tribute to Diego, such as \"La Mano de Dios\" by El Potro Rodrigo, \"Maradona\" by Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, \"Para siempre Diego\" (Diego Forever) by Los Ratones Paranoicos, \"Francotirador\" (Sniper) by Attaque 77, \"Maradona Blues\" by Charly Garc\u00eda, \"Santa Maradona\" (Saint Maradona) by Mano Negra, and \"La Vida T\u00f3mbola\" by Manu Chao, among others. There are also other films, such as: Maradona, La Mano de Dios (Maradona, the Hand of God), Amando a Maradona (Loving Maradona), and Maradona by Kusturica.[224] In March 1981, Queen were introduced to Maradona backstage during their concert at the V\u00e9lez Sarsfield Stadium.[368]\n\nBy 1982, Maradona had become one of the biggest sports stars in the world and had endorsements with many companies, including Puma and Coca-Cola, earning him an additional $1.5\u00a0million per year on top of his club salary.[369] In 1982, he featured in a World Cup commercial for Coca-Cola, and a Japanese commercial for Puma.[369] In 1984 he earned $7m a year at Napoli, and sponsorships included $5m from Hitachi.[304] In 1984, a poll from IMG named Maradona the best known person in the world.[304] In 2010 he appeared in a commercial for French fashion house Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with fellow World Cup winners Pel\u00e9 and Zinedine Zidane.[370] Maradona featured in the music video to the 2010 World Cup song \"Waka Waka\" by Shakira, with footage shown of him celebrating Argentina winning the 1986 World Cup.[371]\n\nA 2006 television commercial for Brazilian soft drink Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica portrayed Maradona as a member of the Brazil national team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian players Ronaldo and Kak\u00e1.[372] Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having too much of the drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air for the Argentine market, fans could see it online). Maradona replied that he had no problem wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil's tense football rivalry, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors' traditional rival.[373] There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona,[374] an example being footballer Diego Costa.[375]\n\nIn 2017, Maradona featured as a legendary player in the football video games FIFA 18 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2018.[376] In 2019, a documentary film titled Diego Maradona was released by Academy Award and BAFTA Award winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia, director of Amy (on singer Amy Winehouse) and Senna (on motor racing driver Ayrton Senna). Kapadia stated that \"\n...Maradona is the third part of a trilogy about child geniuses and fame.\"[377] He added, \"...I was fascinated by his journey, wherever he went there were moments of incredible brilliance and drama. He was a leader, taking his teams to the very top, but also many lows in his career. He was always the little guy fighting against the system... and he was willing to do anything, to use all of his cunning and intelligence to win.\"[378]\n\nMaradona made 680 appearances and scored 345 goals for club and country combined, with a goalscoring average of 0.51.\n\nNotes\n\nNotes\n\nBoca Juniors[382]\n\nBarcelona[382]\n\nNapoli[382]\n\nArgentina U20\n\nArgentina\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona"}, {"id": 4, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/119/2365774/original/wayne-rooney-photo-u36?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Wayne Rooney", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/wayne-rooney/2365774", "desc": "Wayne Mark Rooney (born 24 October 1985) is an English professional footballer who plays for American MLS club D.C.

United in the United States. He spent much of his playing career as a forward while also being used in various midfield roles. Widely considered one of the best players of his generation, Rooney is the record goalscorer for Manchester United, and was the record goalscorer for the England national team from 2015 to 2023. He has also made more appearances for England than any other outfield player.[4]\n\nRooney joined the Everton youth team at the age of nine and made his professional debut for the club in 2002 at the age of 16. He spent two seasons at the Merseyside club before moving to Manchester United for \u00a325.6\u00a0million in the 2004 summer transfer window, where he won 16 trophies and became the only English player, alongside teammate Michael Carrick, to win the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, UEFA Europa League, and FIFA Club World Cup.[5][6][7] He scored 253 goals for United in all competitions, making him the club's top goalscorer of all time; his 183 Premier League goals for United is the third-most scored by a player in that competition for any single club, behind only Harry Kane (currently 188 goals for Tottenham Hotspur) and Sergio Ag\u00fcero (184 goals for Manchester City). Rooney's 208 Premier League goals make him that competition's second-top scorer of all time. He also has the third-highest number of assists in the Premier League, with 103.[8]\n\nRooney made his senior international debut for England in February 2003, aged 17, and is England's youngest-ever goalscorer.[9] He played at UEFA Euro 2004 and scored four goals, briefly becoming the youngest goalscorer in the history of the European Championship.

Rooney grew up supporting Everton.[23] He admired Brazilian striker Ronaldo, with Rooney stating that \"as an out-and-out forward [Ronaldo] was probably the best\".[24]\n\nRooney began playing for Liverpool Schoolboys and scored 72 goals in one season, a record which stood until May 2010.[25] At the age of nine, Rooney played for Copplehouse boys' club in the local Walton and Kirkdale junior league and scored 99 goals in his final season before being spotted by Everton scout Bob Pendleton.[26] Rooney joined Everton at age nine,[27] and was the Everton mascot for the Merseyside derby against Liverpool as an 11-year-old.[28] In the 1995\u201396 season, he scored 114 goals in 29 games for Everton's under-10s and 11s,[29] and by the age of 15, he was playing for the under-19s.[30] He scored eight goals in eight games during Everton's run to the FA Youth Cup Final in 2002.[31] This included one goal in the final defeat against Aston Villa and, upon scoring, he revealed a T-shirt that read, \"Once a Blue, always a Blue.\"[27] Rooney was included in Everton's first team squad for their training camp in Austria in the summer of 2002 and scored his first senior goal in a 3\u20131 friendly victory over SC Weiz on 15 July.[30]\n\n\"Rooney is the biggest England talent I've seen since I arrived in England. There has certainly not been a player under 20 as good as him since I became a manager here.\"\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger on Rooney following his last-minute goal against Arsenal in October 2002.[32]\n\nRooney was an unused substitute in Everton's 1\u20130 away win over Southampton on 20 April 2002.[33] He made his senior debut on 17 August in a 2\u20132 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur, starting the match and assisting the first goal by Mark Pembridge.[34] He became the second youngest first-team player in Everton history behind Joe Royle.[35] In that match, he was booed by the Spurs fans who shouted \"Who are ya?\" whenever he touched the ball.[36] His first senior goals came on 2 October when he scored twice in a 3\u20130 away win over Wrexham in the second round of the League Cup.[37] These goals meant that Rooney was Everton's youngest-ever goalscorer at the time.[38]\n\nOn 19 October, five days before his 17th birthday, Rooney scored a last-minute winning goal against Arsenal.[39] The goal ended Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run,[40] and also made Rooney the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, a record that has since been surpassed by James Milner and James Vaughan.[41] He scored in a 1\u20130 away win over Leeds United 15 days later.[42]\n\nIn December, Rooney was named 2002's BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.[43] Six days after claiming the award he scored the winning goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 2\u20131 home win.[44] His first career red card came on Boxing Day in a 1\u20131 away draw against Birmingham City for a late challenge on Steve Vickers.[45] In January 2003, Rooney signed his first professional contract, which made him one of world football's highest-paid teenagers.[46] Rooney's first goal of 2003 came on 23 March, netting Everton's only goal in a 2\u20131 loss at Arsenal.[47] In April, he scored a goal in Everton's 2\u20131 home win over Newcastle United,[48] before hitting a last-minute winner against Aston Villa in another 2\u20131 home win.[49] He ended his debut season with eight goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees.[50]\n\nRooney scored his first goal of the 2003\u201304 season in a 2\u20132 away draw against Charlton Athletic on 26 August 2003.[51] He did not find the net again until December when he scored in a 2\u20131 away win over Portsmouth,[52] and a 3\u20132 home win over Leicester City.[53] His final goal of 2003 came on his 50th league appearance, netting in a 1\u20130 home win over Birmingham City on 28 December.[54] On 21 February 2004, Rooney scored two goals in a Premier League game for the first time in a 3\u20133 away draw against Southampton.[55] He scored the sole goal in a 1\u20130 win over Portsmouth on 13 March,[56] before scoring in a 1\u20131 away draw against Leicester City one week later.[57] He scored his final goal of the season in a 1\u20131 away draw against Leeds United on 13 April.[58]\n\nIn July, Everton offered Rooney a new five-year contract valued at \u00a350,000 per week,[59] the most lucrative ever offered by the club.[60] Amidst increasing speculation linking Rooney with a transfer, Everton chairman Bill Kenwright admitted the club's financial situation meant a transfer would \"revitalise\" the club.[61] Everton rejected a bid of \u00a320\u00a0million from Newcastle,[62] and Rooney submitted a transfer request on 27 August,[63] with Moyes saying he would not leave unless the club got the right price for him.[64] He ultimately signed for Manchester United at the end of the month after an initial \u00a320\u00a0million deal was reached, with an additional \u00a37\u00a0million in contingency payments, with Rooney signing a five-year contract.[65][66] It was the highest fee ever paid for a player under 20 years old; Rooney was still only 18 when he left Everton.[67] Sir Alex Ferguson, then manager of United, said that \"There were plenty of eyebrows raised\" when he persuaded the club's board of directors to sanction \"a multi-million pound\" move to try to sign Rooney from Everton.[68] In an appearance on United's official podcast in 2020, Rooney revealed Everton had wanted him to sign for Chelsea to ensure a bigger transfer fee,[69] while the mooted transfer to Newcastle would have seen a clause put in place for him to leave after a year to join United.[70]\n\nRooney can do the lot. Eventually he'll have all the United records.\n\n\u2014 United legend Denis Law in September 2004.[71]\n\nRooney was given the number 8 shirt upon his arrival at Old Trafford.[72] He made his United debut on 28 September in a 6\u20132 home win over Fenerbah\u00e7e in the UEFA Champions League, scoring a hat-trick and laying on an assist.[73] These goals made Rooney the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League aged 18 years 335 days.[74] His first season with Manchester United, however, ended without winning a trophy as they could only manage a third-place finish in the league,[75] and failed to progress to the last eight of the Champions League.[76] United had more success in the cup competitions, but were edged out of the League Cup in the semi-finals by a Chelsea side[77] who also won the Premier League title that season.[78] Rooney's second goal in the FA Cup against Middlesbrough on 29 January 2005, a volley hit with the outside of his right foot from the edge of the 18-yard box, was named BBC Goal of the Season.[79] A goalless draw with Arsenal in the FA Cup final was followed by a penalty shoot-out defeat.[80] Rooney was United's top league scorer that season with 11 goals, and was credited with the PFA Young Player of the Year award.[81]\n\nIn September 2005, Rooney was sent off in a goalless Champions League match against Villarreal of Spain for sarcastically clapping the referee, who had booked him for an unintentional foul on an opponent.[82] His first trophy with United came in the 2005\u201306 League Cup,[83] and he was also named man of the match after scoring twice in the final as United won 4\u20130 against Wigan Athletic.[84] His club finished the season as Premier League runners up, with their title hopes ended in late April when they lost 3\u20130 away to champions Chelsea.[85] Rooney sustained a broken metatarsal in that game after a tackle from Paulo Ferreira. Rooney scored a total of 16 goals in 26 Premier League games in the 2005\u201306 season.[86]\n\nRooney was sent off in the 2006 Amsterdam Tournament match against Porto on 4 August 2006 after hitting Porto defender Pepe with his elbow.[87] He was punished with a three-match ban by the FA, following their receipt of a 23-page report from referee Ruud Bossen that explained his decision.[88] Rooney threatened to withdraw the FA's permission to use his image if they did not revoke the ban,[89] although the FA had no power to make such a decision.\n\nDuring the first half of the 2006\u201307 season, Rooney endured a ten-game scoreless streak before scoring a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers.[90] He subsequently signed a two-year contract extension the following month that tied him to United until 2012. In April 2007, Rooney scored and provided an assist for Chris Eagles in a crucial 4\u20132 league win for Manchester United at his former club Everton, a game that also became notable for Rooney's response to fans that once cheered him.\n\n'Once a Blue, always a Blue'. Wayne Rooney's infamous t-shirt was supposed to declare his love for Everton but later fuelled the feeling of betrayal felt by some Everton supporters after his transfer to Manchester United. The boos rang out as loud as ever when Rooney and co. took on Everton at Goodison Park. On 50 minutes, with Everton 2\u20130 up, it seemed the home fans would have the last laugh. However, United fought back and levelled before Rooney tapped in at the far post with 11 minutes to go \u2013 and promptly kissed the badge of his United shirt.\nIn the same month, Rooney scored two goals in an 8\u20133 aggregate Champions League quarter-final win over Roma[92] and two more in the same competition at the end of April, in a 3\u20132 semi-final first leg victory over AC Milan.[93] Rooney collected his first Premier League title winner's medal at the end of the 2006\u201307 season.[94] He scored 14 league goals that season.[95]\n\nIn June 2007, Rooney was given squad number 10, last worn by Ruud van Nistelrooy.[96][97] Rooney reasoned that he always loved that number.[98] He fractured his left metatarsal in United's opening-day goalless draw against Reading on 12 August,[99] the same injury he had suffered to his right foot in 2004.[100] After being sidelined for six weeks, he returned and scored in United's 1\u20130 Champions League group stage win over Roma on 2 October.[101] Rooney was again injured on 9 November, hurting his ankle during a training session and missing an additional two weeks.[102] His next match after injury was against Fulham on 3 December, in which he played 70 minutes.[103] Rooney missed ten games and finished the 2007\u201308 season with 18 goals (12 of them in the league),[86] as United clinched the Premier League.[104] In the Champions League's first-ever all-English final,[105] United defeated league rivals Chelsea to win another trophy.[106]\n\nRooney played in 2008 UEFA Super Cup where United lost to Zenit Saint Petersburg and was unable to make an impact.[107] On 4 October 2008, in an away win over Blackburn, Rooney became the youngest player to make 200 Premier League appearances.[108] On 18 December, Rooney scored twice in the 5\u20133 semi-final victory over Japanese club Gamba Osaka in the FIFA Club World Cup,[109] and, after scoring the winning goal as United beat LDU Quito 1\u20130 in the final in Yokohama,[110] was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player in the tournament.[111] On 14 January after scoring 54 seconds into the 1\u20130 win over Wigan, Rooney limped off with a hamstring injury in the eighth minute.[112] On 25 April 2009, Rooney scored his final league goals of the season against Tottenham; United scored five goals in the second half to come from 2\u20130 down to win 5\u20132; Rooney scored two goals, set up two and provided the assist that led to the penalty for United's first goal.[113] On 27 May, Rooney played against Barcelona in the 2009 Champions League Final in Rome, with United losing 2\u20130.[114] Rooney ended the season with 20 goals in all competitions. Once again, he managed 12 goals in the league.[86]\n\nRooney scored in the 90th minute of the season-opening 2009 Community Shield, although United lost the game to Chelsea on penalties.[115] He then scored the only goal of the first league game of the 2009\u201310 season against Birmingham City, taking his overall United tally to 99.[116] On 22 August, he became the 20th Manchester United player to score 100 goals for the club, when he found the net twice in a 5\u20130 away win at Wigan.[117] On 29 August, United played Arsenal at Old Trafford. Rooney scored a goal from the penalty spot to level the game after Andrey Arshavin had put the Gunners ahead. The game finished 2\u20131 to Manchester United after Abou Diaby scored an own goal.[118] On 28 November 2009, Rooney scored his first hat-trick for three years in a 4\u20131 away victory against Portsmouth, with two of the goals being penalties.[119] On 27 December 2009, he was awarded Man of the Match against Hull City. He was involved in all the goals scored in the game, hitting the opener and then giving away the ball for Hull's equalising penalty. He then forced Andy Dawson into conceding an own goal and then set up Dimitar Berbatov for United's third goal which gave them a 3\u20131 victory.[120] On 30 December 2009, Rooney scored another goal as United beat Wigan 5\u20130 in their final game of the decade.[121]\n\nOn 23 January 2010, Rooney scored all four goals in Manchester United's 4\u20130 win over Hull; three of the goals came in the last ten minutes of the match. This was the first time in his career that he registered four goals in a single match.[122] On 27 January 2010, he continued his scoring run by heading the winner in the second minute of stoppage time against derby rivals Manchester City. This gave United a 4\u20133 aggregate win, taking them into the final; it was his first League Cup goal since netting two in the 2006 final.[123] On 31 January 2010, Rooney scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3\u20131 win over Arsenal for the first time in the league at Emirates Stadium, notably his first Premier League goal also came against Arsenal.[124] On 16 February 2010, Rooney hit his first European goals of the season, scoring two headers in the 3\u20132 away win against Milan in Manchester United's first ever win against them at the San Siro.[125] On 28 February 2010, he scored another header against Aston Villa (his fifth consecutive headed goal) which resulted in Manchester United winning the League Cup final 2\u20131.[126] In the second leg of United's European tie against Milan, Rooney scored a brace in a resounding 4\u20130 home victory, taking his tally of goals that season to 30.[127] He then added two more to his tally five days later at Old Trafford, in a 3\u20130 league win over Fulham.[128]\n\nOn 30 March, during United's Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, Rooney crumpled when he twisted his ankle in the last minute, hobbling off while Bayern were producing the buildup that led to their second goal.[129] There were fears that he had received serious ligament damage or even a broken ankle, but it was announced that the injury was only slight ligament damage, and that he would be out for two to three weeks,[130] missing United's crunch match with Chelsea and the return leg against Bayern the following week.[130] The team list for second leg yielded a massive surprise when Rooney was given a starting place in the United line-up.[131] Despite a 3\u20130 lead by the 41st minute, Bayern snatched a goal back and United were later forced down to 10 men after Rafael was sent-off. Bayern won the match after netting a second away-goal[131] and Rooney was substituted after re-damaging his ankle. On 25 April, Rooney was named the 2010 PFA Players' Player of the Year.[132]\n\nOn 28 August 2010, Rooney scored his first goal of the season as he netted a penalty in a 3\u20130 home win over West Ham United.[133] In October, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson stated at a press conference that Rooney wanted to quit the club.[134] This came after a period of dispute as to the extent of Rooney's ankle injury, where Rooney had refuted Ferguson's claim that the injury was the reason Rooney had been dropped to the bench.[135] Rooney and his representatives released a statement regarding his decision to leave the club, insisting it was not down to money but ambition.[136] Following this statement, Rooney made a dramatic U-turn and agreed a new five-year contract at Manchester United until June 2015.[137]\n\n\"It was stunning. Unbelievable. We've had some fantastic goals here but in terms of execution... you'll never see that.\"\n\nSir Alex Ferguson on Rooney's bicycle kick match-winner against Manchester City.[138]\n\nRooney made his return to the first team as a substitute against Wigan on 20 November.[139] Four days later, he returned to the starting line-up and scored a penalty in a 1\u20130 away win over Rangers in the Champions League.[140] He missed a penalty in a 1\u20130 home win over Arsenal on 13 December.[141] His first goal of the season from open play came on 1 January 2011 in a 2\u20131 away win over West Bromwich Albion.[142] On 1 February, Rooney scored twice and provided an assist for Nemanja Vidi\u0107 in a 3\u20131 home win over Aston Villa.[143] On 12 February, Rooney scored an overhead bicycle kick in the 78th minute of the Manchester derby, which proved to be the winning goal in a 2\u20131 win over Manchester City.[144] After the match, Rooney said it was the best goal of his career,[145] before Sir Alex Ferguson described the strike as the best goal he had ever witnessed at Old Trafford.[146] The acrobatic strike from 10 yards out would win Rooney his third BBC Goal of the Season award, and it was shortlisted for the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award for Goal of the Year (ultimately won by Neymar).[147] Two weeks later, he scored the third goal in a 4\u20130 away win over Wigan,[148] before opening the scoring in a 2\u20131 away loss to Chelsea on 1 March.[149] Rooney scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 home win over Arsenal in an FA Cup tie on 12 March.[150]\n\nOn 2 April, United came from two goals down as Rooney scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 4\u20132 away win over West Ham.[151] This was his fifth hat-trick for Manchester United, whilst the second goal was his 100th in the Premier League for the club.[152] He became the third Manchester United player to score 100 Premier League goals, joining Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.[153] During Rooney's celebrations following his third goal, he swore into a pitchside camera and was subsequently charged by the FA for using offensive language.[154] Rooney accepted the charge, but not the automatic two-match ban which was handed to him.[155] He appealed against the length of the suspension, calling it \"excessive\", but failed to overturn the ban, which ruled him out of the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on 16 April.[156] The following game on 6 April saw Rooney score in a 1\u20130 away win against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.[157] He followed this goal up with another strike in the semi-final first leg against German side Schalke 04 on 26 April, scoring the second of a 2\u20130 away win.[158] This was the first time Rooney had returned to the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen since his sending off during the 2006 FIFA World Cup against Portugal.[159]\n\nOn 14 May 2011, Rooney scored a penalty for United to equalise in a 1\u20131 draw against Blackburn at Ewood Park in the penultimate game of the Premier League season \u2013 enough to secure a record 19th top division title for United, and giving Rooney his fourth Premier League title winner's medal.[160]\n\nRooney started the season with a goal in the first league game at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion. Rooney played a one-two with Ashley Young before a sharp turn and finish from outside the box which found the bottom corner of the goal. He also scored in the second game of the season, at home to Tottenham Hotspur, when he headed in a Ryan Giggs cross.[161] In late August, Rooney scored his 150th goal for United, the first of a hat-trick, helping to beat Arsenal 8\u20132. Rooney won man of the match, scoring two free kicks, a penalty, and also contributing an assist for Nani. On 10 September, Rooney scored another hat-trick in a 5\u20130 away win over Bolton Wanderers on 10 September, becoming only the fourth player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick in consecutive games.[162] These goals brought him level with Bobby Charlton on seven United hat-tricks, joint fourth on the all-time list behind Denis Law, Jack Rowley and Dennis Viollet.[163] After the fallout from his red card against Montenegro on international duty, Rooney was left out of the starting line-up against Liverpool on 15 October 2011.[164] He returned to action on 18 October 2011, where he scored two goals in the Champions League group stage match against O\u021belul Gala\u021bi and surpassed his former teammate Paul Scholes as the highest-scoring Englishman in Champions League history.[165]\n\nOn 10 December, Rooney ended an eight-game goal drought with a brace against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 4\u20131 win at Old Trafford.[166] On 18 December, Rooney continued his goalscoring form, heading home the opening goal against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road; it was Manchester United's quickest of the season so far, as Rooney turned home Antonio Valencia's cross after just 52 seconds.[167] On 21 December, Rooney scored his 130th Premier League goal in his 300th Premier League appearance against Fulham at Craven Cottage with a long-range effort that crashed in off the inside of the post in a 5\u20130 win.[168]\n\nOn 8 January, Rooney scored two goals in the 3\u20132 win over Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium in the FA Cup third round.[169] With these goals, Rooney passed Mark Hughes in United's all-time top goalscorers table, moving up to seventh place overall with 164 goals.[169] On 14 January, Rooney made a big contribution to his team in a 3\u20130 home win against Bolton. Although he missed a penalty, he did create two goals by assisting Paul Scholes for the first goal and Danny Welbeck for the second.[170] On 5 February, Rooney scored twice from the penalty spot as United came back from a 3\u20130 deficit to draw 3\u20133 in a Premier League clash against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.[171] On 11 February 2012, Rooney marked his 500th senior career game by scoring two goals as Manchester United beat rivals Liverpool 2\u20131 at Old Trafford. This was also his 350th game for United in all competitions. On 4 March, Rooney scored the first goal in a 3\u20131 away win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane and passed Joe Spence in Manchester United's all-time top goalscorers table, moving up to sixth place overall with 169 goals. He scored another brace in his next game, against Atletico Bilbao in the UEFA Europa League.[172] On 11 March, Rooney scored the two goals that brought United the victory against West Brom in a 2\u20130 home win. On 15 March, Rooney scored in the second leg of the Europa League tie against Athletic Bilbao in Bilbao despite United losing 2\u20131 on the night and 5\u20133 on aggregate.[173] In the final day of the season, Rooney put United ahead against Sunderland. Their rivals for the Premier League title, Manchester City, were losing 2\u20131 in their game going into injury time, so Rooney's winner looked like it would seal the title. However, Manchester City scored twice in injury time, the clincher a 94th-minute winner from Sergio Ag\u00fcero, to take the trophy.[174]\n\nDespite starting the opening game of the 2012\u201313 season against Everton,[175] Rooney was dropped to the bench for the second game against Fulham in favour of new signing Robin van Persie.[176] After coming on for Shinji Kagawa in the 68th minute, Rooney suffered a severe gash to his right leg caused by Fulham's Hugo Rodallega that kept him out for four weeks.[177] He made his comeback on 29 September in a 3\u20132 loss against Tottenham.[178] Rooney scored his first goals of the season in a 4\u20132 league win at home to Stoke City on 20 October, where he reached his 200th club goal.[179] On 7 November, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season, scoring a penalty in a 3\u20131 win against Braga.[180] He scored twice and provided an assist in a 4\u20133 win against Reading on 1 December.[181] He scored a brace in the Manchester derby at the City of Manchester Stadium on 9 December 2012 which United won 3\u20132.[182] On 16 January, he scored a goal against West Ham in the FA Cup.[183] A fortnight later, he scored twice in a 2\u20131 win against Southampton.[184] He continued to score goals in FA Cup consecutive matches against Fulham[185] and Chelsea.[186] On 12 May, Sir Alex Ferguson announced, after United's 2\u20131 win against Swansea City, that Rooney had handed in his transfer request, a match in which Rooney also requested not to play.[187]\n\nOn 5 July 2013, new United manager David Moyes announced that Rooney was not for sale, after speculation that Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain were among the clubs looking to sign him.[188][189][190] On 17 July 2013, Chelsea confirmed that they had made a bid for Rooney the previous day, thought to be in the region of \u00a320\u00a0million,[191] however it had been rejected by Manchester United.[192] He suffered a head gash in training on 31 August after a collision with Phil Jones which kept him out of the match against Liverpool. He scored his first goal of the season with a free-kick in a 2\u20130 win against Crystal Palace.[193] On 17 September, Rooney scored twice in a 4\u20132 win against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, marking his 200th goal for United in the process.[194] On 22 September, Rooney scored a late consolation goal from a free-kick in the 4\u20131 loss in the Manchester derby against Manchester City.[195] He scored a brace against Tottenham at White Hart Lane in a 2\u20132 draw on 1 December.[196] He scored his 150th league goal for the club with a volley against Hull City on 26 December as United came back from 2\u20130 deficit to win the match 3\u20132; he also provided assists for the other two goals.[197] On 21 February 2014, Rooney signed a contract extension with Manchester United, which will keep him at Old Trafford until 2019.[198] Rooney provided one assist to Robin van Persie as Manchester United defeated Olympiacos in the second leg of Champions League round of 16 tie.[199] On 22 March 2014, Rooney scored two goals for United at West Ham, moving him to third place on the club's all-time scoring list with 212 career goals.[200] Rooney ended the season as both the top scorer and assist for Manchester United in the league with 17 goals and 10 assists.[201] He also had the most assists in the 2013\u201314 Champions League with eight, beating second-placed \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda who had six.[202]\n\n\"Wayne has shown a great attitude towards everything he does. I have been very impressed by his professionalism and his attitude to training and to my philosophy. He is a great inspiration to the younger members of the team and I believe he will put his heart and soul into his captaincy role.\"\n\nLouis van Gaal on naming Rooney Manchester United captain.[203]\n\nAfter the departure of Nemanja Vidi\u0107 from Manchester United in July 2014, Rooney was named club captain by new manager Louis van Gaal ahead of the 2014\u201315 season.[204] On the opening day of the Premier League season on 16 August, Rooney scored a bicycle kick to equalise against Swansea, although United eventually lost 1\u20132.[205] On 27 September 2014, Rooney became the third highest Premier League goalscorer, moving ahead of Thierry Henry with 176 goals after he netted a goal in a 2\u20131 victory against West Ham. In the same match, he was sent off for a foul on Stewart Downing and received a three-game suspension.[206] On 22 November 2014, Rooney scored for United in a 2\u20131 win against rivals Arsenal, their first away win of the season.[207] He continued to score in the following match, in a 3\u20130 win over Hull City.[208] On 14 December, he scored the opening goal in a 3\u20130 win over rivals Liverpool.[209] On 26 December, Rooney scored two goals against Newcastle United, a match which his side won 3\u20131 \u2013 United's 50th successive Boxing Day match.[210] For his performances, Rooney was voted as United's Player of the Month for December.[211] During the season, Rooney was often deployed as a midfielder by Van Gaal.[212]\n\nOn 16 February 2015, in an FA Cup match against Preston North End, Rooney was the subject of criticism for having dived to get a penalty; United would go on to win the match 3\u20131. Replay seemed to have shown that Rooney had not come in contact with the goalkeeper.[213] England manager Roy Hodgson, however, defended Rooney, saying that he was forced to take evasive action.[214] Rooney later apologised for his behaviour, saying, \"that was my chance to get a penalty. I had to use that.\"[215] The penalty was also Rooney's first goal in 2015, ending a goalless run.[216] On 28 February 2015, he scored a brace in a 2\u20130 victory over Sunderland, thus becoming the first player to score more than 10 goals in 11 successive seasons.[217] On 15 March, Rooney scored the third goal in a 3\u20130 win over Tottenham.[218] Rooney was Manchester United's top goalscorer for the 2014\u201315 campaign, but his tally of 14 was the lowest by a leading scorer since 1982. United's goal total of 62 was also its second-worst in the Premier League era.[219]\n\nOn 26 August 2015, Rooney ended an 878-minute scoreless streak by scoring a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win (7\u20131 aggregate) over Belgian side Club Brugge in the second leg of their Champions League play-off. It was his first treble in European competition since his United debut against Fenerbah\u00e7e in 2004.[220] He netted in a 3\u20130 win away to Everton on 17 October, putting him on 187 Premier League goals, joint second with Andy Cole and behind only Alan Shearer.[221] After an injury-related absence, Rooney returned to the starting line-up on 19 December, making his 500th Manchester United appearance in a 2\u20131 home loss to Norwich City.[222]\n\nOn 2 January 2016, Rooney scored in a 2\u20131 win over Swansea to move ahead of Cole as the Premier League's second top scorer of all time, and with 238 he surpassed Denis Law in United's top scorers of all time, behind only Bobby Charlton's 249.[223] Fifteen days later, he scored the only goal in a win against Liverpool at Anfield, his 176th league goal for United, taking Thierry Henry's record for most goals for one club in the Premier League.[224] After being ruled out since 13 February due to a knee injury, Rooney returned to the starting line-up in a 1\u20130 home win over Aston Villa on 16 April.[225] On 21 May, Rooney captained Manchester United in the 2016 FA Cup Final against Crystal Palace. He played the full 120 minutes in central midfield, winning the competition for the first time in his career after a 2\u20131 extra time victory at Wembley Stadium.[226]\n\nOn 7 August 2016, Rooney set up Jesse Lingard's opening goal in Manchester United's 2\u20131 victory over Leicester City in the 2016 FA Community Shield, lifting his second title as the club's captain.[227][228] On 6 November 2016, Rooney became only the third player ever to achieve 100 Premier League assists, setting up both of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107's goals in a 3\u20131 away win against Swansea City.[229][230] On 24 November, Rooney overtook Ruud van Nistelrooy to become Manchester United's all-time leading scorer in European competitions with 39 goals, opening the scoring in a 4\u20130 home win over Feyenoord in the Europa League.[231]\n\nOn 7 January 2017, Rooney scored against Reading in the third round of the FA Cup to equal Bobby Charlton as Manchester United's top goalscorer of all time. Rooney's goal was his 249th in 543 games for Manchester United, reaching the landmark in 215 matches and four seasons quicker than Charlton.[232] On 21 January 2017, Rooney finally surpassed Charlton to become the outright leading scorer for Manchester United after scoring his 250th goal for the club and the equaliser from a free kick against Stoke City at the Bet365 Stadium in the game's final minutes to secure a 1\u20131 draw.[233] On 29 January, prior to playing his part in the 4\u20130 triumph in the FA Cup fourth round against Wigan Athletic, Rooney was presented with a commemorative Golden Boot to acknowledge him becoming the club's all-time leading goal scorer. It was presented by Charlton whose record Rooney broke.[234] On 14 May 2017, in a 2\u20131 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on the last day of the Premier League season, Rooney had the distinction of scoring the final goal at Spurs' White Hart Lane stadium.[235] In his last game for Manchester United, Rooney came on as a substitute as United beat Ajax 2\u20130 to win the UEFA Europa League.[236] He finished his Manchester United career as the all-time top scorer for the club with 253 goals, winning five Premier League titles and each of the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup.[237]\n\nAfter much speculation over the previous few months, it was confirmed on 9 July 2017 that Rooney would return to his boyhood club, Everton, on a two-year contract, after Manchester United allowed him to leave on a free transfer.[237] Rooney was assigned the number 10 shirt for the 2017\u201318 campaign.[238] He made his first official appearance on his return to the club in a 1\u20130 win over MFK Ru\u017eomberok in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round first leg on 27 July.[239] He scored on his second Everton league debut on 12 August, when his club beat Stoke City 1\u20130 at Goodison Park.[240] Nine days later, Rooney scored his 200th Premier League goal in a 1\u20131 away draw against Manchester City, becoming the second player to reach this landmark, Alan Shearer being the first.[241][242] On 29 November, Rooney scored his first hat-trick for Everton in 4\u20130 win over West Ham; his third goal was a strike from inside his own side's half of the field \u2013 over 60 yards from goal \u2013 scoring as goalkeeper Joe Hart left the penalty area to clear the ball.[243]\n\nIn a 3\u20131 win against Swansea City on 18 December, Rooney scored a penalty and provided the assist for Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson's goal, which put him ahead of Frank Lampard as the player with the third-highest amounts of assists in the Premier League, with 103.[8] He appeared on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football as a pundit in February 2018, garnering praise from The Guardian writer Sachin Nakrani for being \"articulate, intelligent, insightful and honest\".[244] On the show he named Anfield, home of Manchester United's rivals Liverpool, as his hardest test, with Rooney stating \"I never enjoyed playing there\".[245]\n\nOn 28 June 2018, Rooney signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with D.C. United of Major League Soccer, and was given the number 9 jersey.[246] He officially completed his move to the Washington-based team when the US mid-season transfer window opened on 10 July.[247]\n\nRooney made his debut for D.C. United on 14 July, coming on for Darren Mattocks in the 59th minute of a 3\u20131 win against the Vancouver Whitecaps; provided the assist for Paul Arriola's second goal, which gave D.C. a 3\u20130 lead.[248] Rooney's debut came on the unveiling of Audi Field, D.C. United's new home stadium.[249] Rooney was named captain after three games by manager Ben Olsen, with the consent of former captain Steve Birnbaum.[250][251] His first goal for the club came on 28 July in his first game with the armband, slotting past his former Manchester United teammate, goalkeeper Tim Howard, securing a 2\u20131 win over the Colorado Rapids at Audi Field; he left the game with a broken nose after a clash of heads with Axel Sj\u00f6berg.[252][253]\n\nAfter putting in positive performances for D.C. United, including a last-ditch tackle and pass for the game-winning goal against Orlando on 12 August,[254] and helping them to a play-off spot, he was named 'MLS Player of the Month' for the month of October 2018.[255] His team made the 2018 MLS Cup Playoffs but were knocked out at home to the Columbus Crew SC in the first round, in which his attempt in the penalty shootout was saved by Zack Steffen.[256] At the end of the 2018 MLS campaign, he was named as D.C. United's MVP and golden boot winner, having scored 12 goals in 21 matches.[257]\n\nOn 16 March 2019, Rooney notched his first hat-trick for D.C. United in a 5\u20130 home win over Real Salt Lake, also contributing an assist,[258] and later in the season he scored his 300th career goal at club level in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Houston Dynamo.[259] On 27 June, Rooney scored from inside his own half for the third time in his career with a match-winning strike from 10 yards behind the halfway line to lob Orlando City goalkeeper Brian Rowe.[260] He played his final match for the club on 19 October, in a 5\u20131 away defeat to Toronto FC, in the first round of the playoffs. He ended his time in the MLS with 23 goals and 15 assists in 48 regular-season appearances.[261]\nHe had a total of 25 goals in 52 appearances (all competitions) for D.C. United.[262]\n\nOn 6 August 2019, with two years left on his contract with D.C. United, Rooney agreed a deal to return to England as a player-coach with EFL Championship side Derby County in January 2020.[263] Rooney was instantly named captain and his debut came on 2 January as he started and assisted the first goal in a 2\u20131 win against Barnsley.[264] Rooney scored six goals in twenty four appearances, including the deciding goals in a 2\u20131 victory against Reading and a 1\u20130 win at Preston North End, as Derby finished the season in 10th.\n\nRooney's first goal of the 2020\u201321 season came in the fourth match as his 87th-minute free kick proved the difference in 1\u20130 win away to Norwich City. It was Derby's first win of the season and took the club out of the bottom three after opening the campaign with three successive defeats. Results did not improve however, with manager Phillip Cocu leaving by mutual consent after a 1\u20130 home defeat to Queens Park Rangers. Rooney in particular came under criticism for his performances in the opening stages of the season.[265] It was announced on 26 November that Rooney, who had replaced Cocu as part of a four-man interim management team, would take sole control of the side for the upcoming match against Wycombe Wanderers and had removed himself from the playing squad,[266] admitting that it was \"possible\" he had played his final game.[267] On 15 January 2021, he retired from playing after being appointed permanent manager of Derby.[268]\n\nRooney was eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland, through his Irish paternal grandparents.[15][269] In 2015, he confirmed that he had rejected an approach from Ireland at the age of 16, describing himself as \"English through and through\".[270]\n\nRooney became the youngest player to play for England when he earned his first cap in a friendly defeat against Australia at the Boleyn Ground on 12 February 2003 at 17 years and 111 days, coming on at half-time as manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson fielded a different team in each half.[271] On 6 September of that year, aged 17 years and 317 days, he became the youngest player to score for England, equalising in a 2\u20131 away victory over Macedonia in a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match.[272]\n\nHis first tournament action was at UEFA Euro 2004, in which he became the youngest scorer in competition history on 17 June 2004, when he scored twice in England's second group match against Switzerland, which ended in a 3\u20130 victory;[273] however, this record was topped by Swiss midfielder Johan Vonlanthen four days later.[274] Rooney added two more goals in the competition in England's final group match on 21 June, a 4\u20132 win over Croatia,[275] but subsequently suffered an injury in the quarter-final match against hosts Portugal on 24 June, and England were eliminated on penalties.[276] After scoring four goals in four matches, Rooney was named in UEFA's Team of the Tournament.[277]\n\nFollowing a foot injury in an April 2006 Premier League match, Rooney faced a race to fitness for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.[278] England attempted to hasten his recovery with the use of an oxygen tent,[279] which allowed Rooney to enter a group match against Trinidad and Tobago[280] and start the next match against Sweden.[281] However, he never got back into game shape and went scoreless as England bowed out in the quarter-finals, again on penalty kicks.[282]\n\nRooney was red-carded in the 62nd minute of the quarter-final for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho as both attempted to gain possession of the ball. Rooney seemed to be pulled back by Carvalho, and then trod on his opponent's groin as the Chelsea defender was on the floor trying to win the ball, an incident that occurred right in front of the Argentine referee Horacio Elizondo.[283][284]\n\nPortugal winger (and Rooney's Manchester United teammate) Cristiano Ronaldo protested his actions, and was in turn pushed by Rooney.[284] Elizondo sent Rooney off, after which Ronaldo was seen winking at the Portugal bench.[284] Rooney denied intentionally targeting Carvalho in a statement on 3 July, adding,\n\nI bear no ill feeling to Cristiano but I'm disappointed that he chose to get involved. I suppose I do, though, have to remember that on that particular occasion we were not teammates.[285]\nElizondo confirmed the next day that Rooney was dismissed solely for the infraction on Carvalho.[286] Rooney was fined CHF5,000 for the incident.[287]\n\nRooney top scored for England in their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign with nine goals; one behind the UEFA section's overall top goalscorer, Theofanis Gekas of Greece.[288] On 14 November 2009, Rooney captained England for the first time in a pre-tournament friendly with Brazil.[289]\n\nRooney was given the England number 10 shirt by manager Fabio Capello ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[290] During the tournament, England drew 0\u20130 in their second group match against Algeria on 18 June, and the England players were booed off the pitch by their supporters; Rooney was at the centre of controversy when he criticised the England fans for booing the team after the match,[291] and subsequently apologised for his actions.[292] Rooney went scoreless throughout the tournament, and England were eliminated in the second round, following a 4\u20131 defeat to Germany on 27 June.[293]\n\nThe Euro 2012 qualification campaign went well for England, as they qualified at the top of their group, winning five and drawing three games. Rooney scored three goals, one against Switzerland and two against Bulgaria. In the last qualifier against Montenegro (2\u20132), Rooney was sent off for a tackle on Miodrag D\u017eudovi\u0107 in the 74th minute.[294] It was anticipated that Rooney would miss at least one match in the opening round of the first phase at UEFA Euro 2012. After the game, Rooney sent a personal letter to UEFA in which he apologised and expressed regret for the tackle on D\u017eudovi\u0107 which earned him the red card.[295]\n\nDespite the letter, UEFA punished Rooney with a three-game ban, meaning that he could not play in any of the group stage matches. After UEFA's announcement, D\u017eudovi\u0107 stated that he believed the sentence for Rooney was too severe and that he would defend him if needed. He later asked the UEFA to pardon Rooney. The FA then decided they would appeal to UEFA against the ban. On 8 December 2011, after the FA had appealed the ban, UEFA reduced the sentence to two matches.[296] This meant that Rooney missed the matches against France and Sweden. He was able to play in the final match of the group stage against Ukraine on 19 June 2012, scoring the only goal of the game, allowing England to progress to the quarter-finals.[297] England were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals against Italy, who, after a scoreless 120 minutes, won 4\u20132 on penalties, although Rooney was able to net his spot-kick. After another international tournament in which the English media criticised Rooney's performances, Fabio Capello claimed Rooney \"only plays well in Manchester.\"[298]\n\nOn 12 October 2012, Rooney became England's fifth-highest goalscorer of all time after scoring his 30th and 31st international goals in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against San Marino. Rooney captained England for the first time in a competitive match in the same game. On 6 February 2013, Rooney scored in a 2\u20131 win against five-time world champions Brazil at Wembley in a friendly.[299] In March, he scored goals against San Marino and Montenegro in World Cup qualifying,[300][301] before scoring against Brazil again in a 2\u20132 draw on 2 June, in the official re-opening of the refurbished Maracan\u00e3 Stadium.[302] On 11 October 2013, Rooney became England's all-time top goalscorer in competitive internationals when he scored his 27th competitive goal in a 4\u20131 World Cup qualifier against Montenegro.[303] Rooney ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as England's top scorer with seven goals.[304]\n\nAt the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Rooney started in England's first group match against Italy, setting up Daniel Sturridge's temporary equaliser, in a 2\u20131 loss.[305] In England's second 2014 World Cup group match against Uruguay at the Arena Corinthians, Rooney scored his first ever goal at a World Cup finals with a 75th-minute equaliser in a 2\u20131 loss.[306] England drew their final group match 0\u20130 against Costa Rica, and were eliminated from the World Cup, finishing last in their group; despite playing a part in both of England's goals, Rooney was criticised by English pundits for his performance in the tournament.[307]\n\nFollowing Steven Gerrard's international retirement after the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Roy Hodgson named Rooney as England's new captain.[308] On 3 September 2014, in the first match of his captaincy, Rooney scored a penalty against Norway to give England a 1\u20130 friendly win.[309] Later on, he showed his leadership qualities by calling player-only meetings in September 2014 to reflect on the players' performance and discuss how they could do better as a team. Rooney said,\n\nObviously the manager gives us our game plan, but because we don't spend that much time together as a team we need to know and feel confident in what we're doing as a team together. In the meetings, you're having the players speak up who wouldn't normally speak up when coaches are there.[310]\nOn 15 November 2014, Rooney won his 100th England cap against Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifying match, scoring a penalty to equalise in a 3\u20131 win.[311] In another qualifier away to the same opponents on 14 June 2015, Rooney scored the winner with four minutes remaining for a 3\u20132 victory, his 48th international goal putting him joint second in England's list alongside Gary Lineker, and one behind Bobby Charlton.[312] In his 106th England appearance, he equalled Charlton's record of 49 goals (also in 106 matches) on 5 September 2015 by scoring a penalty against San Marino.[313] On 8 September 2015, Rooney broke Charlton's England goalscoring record, netting his 50th international goal from a penalty in a Euro 2016 qualifying match against Switzerland, at Wembley, in his 107th appearance for England, also equalling Ashley Cole as his country's fifth-highest capped player;[314] this was also his 300th professional career goal.[315]\n\nIn England's opening match of UEFA Euro 2016 against Russia at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome in Marseille on 11 June, Rooney was selected to start in central midfield and was named man of the match by the BBC after a 1\u20131 draw.[316] On 27 June, he scored the opening goal against Iceland in the round of 16 from a penalty in the 4th minute. However England would eventually lose the match 2-1 which subsequently eliminated them from the tournament.[317]\n\nOn 4 September 2016, Rooney earned his 116th appearance for England in 1\u20130 away win over Slovakia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, making him the nation's most-capped outfield player of all time, and England's second highest appearance maker behind Peter Shilton.[318] A few days earlier, he had confirmed that he would retire from international football after the finals in Russia.[319] In March 2017, Rooney had been left out of the England squad by England boss Gareth Southgate.[320] Following Rooney's return to Everton in July, which saw him put on a string of impressive performances, Southgate wanted to recall Rooney back to the England squad for the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.[321] However, Rooney announced his early retirement from international football with immediate effect on 23 August 2017, snubbing Southgate's recall.[320][322]\n\nOn 4 November 2018, it was confirmed that Rooney would come out of international retirement to play one final match for the England national football team against the United States at Wembley Stadium on 15 November. This was in order to promote The Wayne Rooney Foundation, a newly formed charity;[323] consequently, the match was called the \"Wayne Rooney Foundation International\".[324] He came on in the 58th minute of England's eventual 3\u20130 home win, ending his international career with 120 appearances.[325]\n\nIn August 2020, Rooney was announced as the manager for the England team at Soccer Aid 2020, assisted by Sam Allardyce and goalkeeper coach David Seaman.[326]\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2020\u201321 season saw Derby County bottom of the Championship table \u2013 their lowest position for 12 years \u2013 Derby boss Phillip Cocu was sacked, and Rooney was appointed as part of a four-man interim coaching staff alongside Liam Rosenior, Shay Given and Justin Walker.[327] Rooney's first game in charge saw Derby lose 1\u20130 at Bristol City to leave them at the foot of the table and three points from safety, though Rooney said he could guarantee that the side would \"get better (and) get out of the situation we're in and... start winning games.\"[328] Following a \"painful and chastening\" 3\u20130 defeat to Middlesbrough it was announced that Rooney would take sole control of the side for the next match and had removed himself from the playing squad,[266] with Rooney making clear his desire to take the role full time.[267] Rooney started sole charge with The Rams in 24th, six points adrift of safety and on a run of four consecutive defeats; after improving Derby's form enough to get them out of the relegation zone he was appointed as permanent manager on 15 January.[268]\n\nBy mid-February 2021, having accrued 31 points from a possible 54 in his 18 games in sole charge, taking Derby up to 18th in the league and eight points clear of the relegation zone, Rooney was feted by the press for \"convincing the doubters\"[329] and found himself as 25/1 outsider for the Celtic job following the resignation of Neil Lennon.[330] Following this, however, form faltered badly with just one win from fourteen leaving Derby firmly in trouble,[331] with Rooney's side being criticised for its poor game management and sloppy defending[332] and suggestion that Rooney came across \"as a manager who\u2019s accepted defeat, who\u2019s surrender himself to whatever results might come his way\" and should be replaced.[331] Others defended Rooney, saying that though he had made mistakes, particularly in making \"too many changes to personnel and shape/tactics\" he had not been helped by injuries and too many players who had \"been inconsistent (and) unable to maintain form both during a game and from game to game.\"[333] However, at the last match of the season, Derby County drew 3\u20133 at home with Sheffield Wednesday to barely avoid relegation.[334]\n\nDerby were relegated to League One at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, having spent almost the entire season in Administration. With Derby still in Administration going into the League One season, Rooney resigned as manager on 24 June 2022.[335][336]\n\nOn 12 July 2022, Rooney was announced as head coach for D.C. United.[337] He replaced outgoing manager Hern\u00e1n Losada.\n\nRegarded as one of the best players of his generation,[338][339] Rooney was a creative, energetic forward who combined technical skill with strength and physicality, while also excelling in the air despite being 5\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (1.76\u00a0m) tall.[340][341] He was a versatile attacker, capable of playing anywhere along the front line;[342][343] although his preferred role was as a striker.[344] Rooney was also used as a supporting forward, or even as a winger.[345][346][347] As his pace and movement declined as he entered his thirties, he was deployed in deeper, more creative roles, as an attacking midfielder, as a deep-lying playmaker, or even as a central or box-to-box midfielder, in particular under former manager Louis van Gaal, due to his vision, range of passing, runs forward from midfield, and team-work.[348][349][350] He was also occasionally deployed as a false attacking midfielder,[351] and as a false 9 throughout his career.[352]\n\nA prolific goalscorer in his prime at Manchester United, Rooney was a powerful striker of the ball and an accurate finisher, capable of scoring both inside and outside the penalty area, as well as from volleys.[353][354] His ball striking ability saw him score from inside his own half for Manchester United, Everton, and D.C. United.[355] He was praised for his work-rate and stamina by players, managers and the media, and was highly regarded for his dedication and willingness to press opponents when possession had been lost in order to win back the ball and start attacking plays.[353][338] While not known to be particularly prolific from free kicks, he also often took set pieces[356][357][358] and penalties throughout his career,[359][360] although his record from the spot was somewhat inconsistent.[361]\n\nDue to his precocious displays as a teenager, Wayne Rooney was given the nicknames \"Wazza\" (a reference to former England international Paul \"Gazza\" Gascoigne, who was also a gifted player troubled by off-field issues),[362] \"The Wonder Boy\", \"the new Pel\u00e9\", and \"the white Pel\u00e9\".[363][364] Rooney was a fast, agile player in his youth;[365] however, several injuries throughout his career, in addition to weight issues, affected his speed and mobility as his career progressed, which led to some in the game accusing him of not quite living up to his full potential.[366][367] He was warned about his fitness on numerous occasions by his manager Alex Ferguson, who said of Rooney, \"He is very stocky, he is going to have to train well all the time.\"[368] Former Manchester United fitness coach Mick Clegg, stated, \"Wayne didn't see the importance of the gym really. He'd say 'I'm here to play football.\"[369] Rooney was criticised for his behaviour and aggression on the pitch at times, which led him to pick up unnecessary bookings.[353][362]\n\nFormerly the all-time leading goalscorer for the England national team, Rooney is viewed as one of England's greatest players.[370] In 2017, Gareth Southgate said: \"You've got very good players and then there are top players. In my time in the England setup, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and Rooney just had that little bit more than all the others. And we are talking high\u2011level people there, players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and David Beckham.\"[371]\n\nIn addition to Everton, Rooney also supports Celtic.[372] He is also a supporter of the Leeds Rhinos rugby league club.[373] Rooney, originally a boxer, still pursues the sport recreationally for stress relief.[374] A friend of boxer Ricky Hatton, in 2007 he carried one of Hatton's belts into the ring in his world light-welterweight title fight against Jos\u00e9 Luis Castillo in Las Vegas.[375] The decision of Hatton (a Manchester City fan) to have a Manchester United striker carry the belt prompted threats of a boycott among the many Manchester City supporters who made up Hatton's fanbase.[375] Hatton responded, \"Nobody hates United more than me. Just because I don't support his team doesn't mean I can't admire what he has done.\"[375] Rooney has a number of tattoos, including one of a Celtic cross on his arm.[376]\n\nRooney met his wife, Coleen (n\u00e9e McLoughlin), while both were at secondary school.[377] They married on 12 June 2008 after six years of dating.[378] He has a tattoo of the words \"Just Enough Education to Perform\", the title of an album by his favourite band, the Stereophonics; Coleen arranged for the group to play at their wedding reception.[379] The wedding ran into some controversy with the Catholic Church. The couple held a religious ceremony at the Abbey of Cervara, a converted monastery near Genoa, despite being warned by the local bishop's office against the plan. The bishop's office told the Rooneys that La Cervara is deconsecrated and not suitable for a wedding. It suggested a different church, five miles away. Nevertheless, the couple ignored the advice and Father Edward Quinn, their local Catholic priest from Croxteth, presided over the ceremony.[380] Coleen's favourite pop band Westlife also sang at the wedding reception.[381]\n\nThe couple have four sons: Kai Wayne (born 2 November 2009),[382] Klay Anthony (born 21 May 2013),[383] Kit Joseph (born 24 January 2016),[384] and Cass Mac (born 15 February 2018).[385] Kai Rooney signed with Manchester United in 2020, becoming a second-generation player for the Red Devils.[386]\n\nIn 2004, Rooney admitted to soliciting prostitutes in Liverpool, while dating his then-girlfriend. \"I was young and stupid. It was at a time when I was very young and immature and before I had settled down with Coleen.\"[387] In April 2006, Rooney was awarded \u00a3100,000 in libel damages from tabloids The Sun and News of the World, who had claimed that he had assaulted Coleen in a nightclub. Rooney donated the money to charity.[388]\n\nRooney's younger brother, John Rooney, is also a professional footballer who plays for Oldham Athletic. Rooney's cousin, Tommy Rooney, is also a footballer.[389] Another cousin, Jake Rooney, is also a professional footballer for Derby County.[390]\n\nRooney has endorsement deals with Nike (he is the face of their T90 Laser IV boots[391]), Nokia,[392] Ford,[393][394] Asda,[395] and Coca-Cola.[396] He appeared on seven consecutive UK-version covers of Electronic Arts' FIFA video game series from FIFA 06 to FIFA 12.[397][398][399] His \"knockout\" goal celebration \u2013 a tongue in cheek celebration by Rooney inspired by getting knocked down by a teammate in his home \u2013 appears in FIFA 18.[400] He has featured in Nike commercials, including Write the Future directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in 2010 where he is knighted, and a tabloid shows his face carved into the Cliffs of Dover with the headline \"JUST ROO IT!\".[401] In October 2010, Rooney was dropped by Coca-Cola from an advertising campaign following issues surrounding his private life.[402] In 2012, Rooney's reported income of US$32.6\u00a0million listed him as the world's fifth highest-paid footballer, following Lionel Messi, David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Samuel Eto'o.[403]\n\nIn July 2011, jerseys with Rooney's name and number (Rooney, 10) were the best-selling sports product under the auspices of the Premier League \u2013 taking over top spot from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres (Torres, 9) and becoming the first United player to top the list since Cristiano Ronaldo's number 7 jersey in 2008.[404] During the 2009\u201310 season, Manchester United sold between 1.2\u00a0million and 1.5\u00a0million shirts and it is estimated that of that, Rooney's name was printed on several hundred thousand. The account is taken from official jerseys sales across the globe, not just in England.[404]\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Rooney signed the largest sports book deal in publishing history with HarperCollins,[405] who granted him a \u00a35\u00a0million advance plus royalties for a minimum of five books to be published over a 12-year period. The first, My Story So Far, an autobiography ghostwritten by Hunter Davies, was published after the 2006 World Cup.[406] The second publication, The Official Wayne Rooney Annual, was aimed at the teenage market and edited by football journalist Chris Hunt.[407] His third book, My Decade in the Premier League, was published in September 2012.[408]\n\nIn July 2006, Rooney's lawyers went to the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to gain ownership of the Internet domain names waynerooney.com and waynerooney.co.uk, both of which Welsh actor Huw Marshall registered in 2002.[409] Three months later, the WIPO awarded Rooney the rights to waynerooney.com.[410]\n\nIn October 2014, Rooney became the first Premier League footballer to reach 10\u00a0million followers on social networking site Twitter. That same month, Rooney was the fifth most-followed footballer (and sixth most-followed sportsperson) globally on Twitter. In terms of top UK Twitter individuals, Rooney ranked at number 9 in October 2014.[411]\n\nIn July 2002, while Rooney was with Everton, agent Paul Stretford encouraged Rooney and his parents to enter the player into an eight-year contract with Proactive Sports Management. However, Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time, while Stretford's transaction went unreported to the FA, and he was thus charged with improper conduct. Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney's earnings.[412]\n\nStretford's case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney, and on 9 July 2008, he was found guilty of \"making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police, and giving false and/or misleading testimony\".[412] In addition, the contract to which Stretford had signed Rooney was two years longer than the limit allowed by the FA. Stretford was fined \u00a3300,000 and given an 18-month ban as a football agent, a verdict he appealed.[412]\n\nStretford left Proactive in 2008 and took Rooney with him. Proactive later sued Rooney, claiming \u00a34.3\u00a0million in withheld commissions. In July 2010, Proactive was awarded \u00a390,000 as restitution.[413]\n\nOn 1 September 2006, then-Everton manager David Moyes sued Rooney for libel after the tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail published excerpts from Rooney's 2006 autobiography that accused the manager of leaking Rooney's reasons for leaving the club to the press.[414] The case was settled out of court for \u00a3500,000 on 3 June 2008, and Rooney apologised to Moyes for \"false claims\" he had made in the book regarding the matter.[415]\n\nHelen Wood claims Rooney paid \u00a31,000 for a threesome with her and Jennifer Thompson in a Manchester hotel while his wife was five months pregnant.[416] It was reported his solicitors unsuccessfully tried to fight the allegations when they first surfaced in early August 2010.[417][418]\n\nOn 1 September 2017, Rooney was arrested in Wilmslow by Cheshire police after being caught driving over the prescribed alcohol limit.[419][420] He appeared at Stockport Magistrates' Court on 18 September and pleaded guilty to drink driving.[421] Rooney was fined \u00a3170 by the court and banned from driving for two years, and was ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work as part of a twelve-month community order; Everton fined him two weeks' wages, which was in the region of \u00a3300,000.[421]\n\nOn 16 December 2018, Rooney was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport in Loudoun County, Virginia, charged with public intoxication and use of profanity in public. He was released without bail on a personal recognizance bond, then fined $25 plus $91 in costs without going to court.[422]\n\nManchester United\n\nEngland U17\n\nIndividual\n\nRecords\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney"}, {"id": 5, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/117/2333109/original/viacheslav-malafeev-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Vyacheslav Malafeev", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/viacheslav-malafeev/2333109", "desc": "Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Malafeev (Russian: \u0412\u044f\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0444\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432, IPA: [v\u02b2\u026at\u0255\u026a\u02c8slav \u0250l\u02b2\u026a\u02c8ksandr\u0259v\u02b2\u026at\u0255 m\u0259l\u0250\u02c8f\u02b2e\u026af]; born 4 March 1979) is a Russian football official and a former player who played as a goalkeeper.

In 2004, he was recognized as the best scorer of the AFC Asian Cup and received the Asian Footballer of the Year award in the same year. He announced his retirement at the end of the 2013\u201314 season and, on 11 April 2014, played the final game of his 18-year career.[8]\n\nKarimi's professional career began with Fath tehran, where he made his first-team debut in 1996 aged 18. He then played three seasons with Persepolis, winning the Iranian league twice and the Hazfi Cup once with the club. In July 2001, Karimi signed a two-year contract with UAE Pro League club Al-Ahli Dubai.[9] While an Al-Ahli player, Karimi won two cup titles, and was the top-goalscorer in the 2003\u201304 season, an impressive feat for a midfielder. After leaving the club in 2005 aged 26, Karimi made a long-awaited move to Europe to play for Bayern Munich. At the club he had relative success, winning both the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal in 2005\u201306 season. Later in his career, he rejoined former coach Felix Magath and won a second German Cup with Schalke 04. Karimi ended his playing career in Iran with Persepolis and Tractor Sazi, and with the latter won the Hazfi Cup in the final season of his career.\n\nIn international football, Karimi made his Iran debut on 13 October 1998, at the age of 19. He made 127 career appearances in total, appearing at five major tournaments including 1998 Asian Games, 2000, 2004, and 2007 Asian Cups and 2006 FIFA World Cup. Renowned for his on-the-ball skill, dribbling runs and playmaking ability, he was often referred to as the Asian Maradona[10]\u200f[11] and The Magician.[12] In the video introducing Iran's national football team in the 2018 World Cup, by FIFA, he was described as \"One of the top 2 players of Iran's football history\".[13] He is regarded as one of the greatest Asian footballers of all time.[14]\u200f[15] In 2017, AFC named Karimi as \"one of the icons of Asian football history\".[14]\n\nKarimi is known as one of the most popular athletes in the history of Iran. In April 2015, he was recognized as Iran's most popular football player (from 1991 to 2015) in a poll by Navad television program.[16]\n\nKarimi started his professional career with second division side Fath Football Club in 1997 where training was conducted on the streets with a plastic ball.\n\nIn 1998, Karimi joined Persepolis football club, which won the domestic double in 1999 and the championship again in 2000. He attended a trial with Perugia Calcio, but the transfer was aborted when Perugia deemed the transfer fee too high.[17] There was also reportedly an offer from Spain's Atl\u00e9tico Madrid who were willing to pay Karimi \u00a34.3 million in a four-year contract, but Karimi opted for United Arab Emirates side Al-Ahli because he wanted to stay close to home.[18][19]\n\nKarimi signed with Al Ahli in the United Arab Emirates in 2001, for a reported salary of $1.3 million for two years.[20] In that season, Al-Ahli managed to win its first trophy, when they became the Winners of the President Cup in 2001\u201302 season.\n\nHe scored a league-high 14 goals for Al Ahli in 2004.[18] In June 2020, he was named the best foreign player in the UAE League as well.[21]\n\nOn 3 May 2005, Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich's website announced that as its first new player for the 2005\u201306 season, it signed Karimi with a one-year contract, as the third Iranian player of this team, after Ali Daei (1998\u201399) and Vahid Hashemian (2004\u201305).[22][23] After the friendly match between Iran and Germany in October 2004, Karimi was noticed by the Bayern Munich club. He received the best score in kicker magazine after Jens Lehmann.[24]\n\nKarimi entered the field in the second half of the first week of the Bundesliga against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.[25] In the second week's 5\u20132 victory against Bayer Leverkusen, he was recognized as the second best player of the match by scoring a goal and providing an assist.[26] Six weeks into the league, Karimi scored his second goal assist in the Bundesliga, setting the stage for a 1\u20130 win against Eintracht Frankfurt and was recognized as the man of the match.[27] In week 16 of the Bundesliga, he provided his third assist against Kaiserslautern.[28] At the end of the half-season of the Bundesliga, which was accompanied by Bayern's 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund, Karimi scored again.[29][30] He was also recognized as Bayern Munich's best player by scoring 2.5 points from kicker magazine in the 22nd Bundesliga match, which ended with a 1\u20131 draw against Hannover.[31]\n\nKarimi made his 25th appearance for Bayern on 4 March 2006 against Hamburg, which resulted in an automatic 12-month extension to his one-year contract that expired on 30 June 2007. But Karimi was injured in the same game, and missed all Bayern Munich matches until the end of the 2005-2006 season.[32]\n\nHe played 3 times in the UEFA Champions League[33] before getting injured, scoring in his first game against Rapid Vienna.[34] By scoring against Rapid Vienna,[35] Karimi became the only Iranian Bayern Munich player to score in the UEFA Champions League.[33]\u200f[36]\u200f[37] Before the injury, Karimi played in 20 Bundesliga games, two DFB-Pokal games, one DFL-Ligapokal game and three UEFA Champions League games.[33]\n\nKarimi's average scores in the Bundesliga and the UEFA Champions League in the 2005\u201306 season are the best among the three Iranian players in the kicker magazine.[33]\u200f[36]\u200f[37]\n\nKarimi, who was still suffering from the injury of the previous season, was injured again before the start of the 2006-2007 season and missed the opening games of the season. By the end of the 2006\u201307 season, he played a total of 16 games (13 Bundesliga games - two UEFA Champions League games and one DFL-Ligapokal game).[38]\n\nIn the 32nd week of the Bundesliga, Karimi became the foundation for Bayern's 1\u20131 draw against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach by sending a goal assist.[39] In week 34 of the Bundesliga, he played his last game for Bayern in a 5\u20132 win against Mainz[38] and scored for the last time in Bayern Munich. In this competition after Mehmet Scholl; Karimi was recognized as the second best player of Bayern together with Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107 by scoring 2.5 from kicker magazine.[40]\n\nIn two seasons in Bayern Munich, Karimi played 42 games[41] (33 Bundesliga games, 5 UEFA Champions League games, 2 DFB-Pokal games and 2  DFL-Ligapokal games) and became the record holder for the most number of games among the three Iranian players of this team. Karimi ended his career in Bayern Munich by scoring four goals and sending four assists.[41] In 2017, the Transfermarkt website named Karimi among the best players who joined Bayern Munich from 1998 to 2017 as a free agent (a player who is eligible to sign a contract with any team and whose contract has expired with his previous team) and performed well. In this team have been placed.[42]\n\n\"My first year at Bayern, a pleasure to play with this legend Ali Karimi. He is the best ever from Iran,\"\n\nLukas Podolski, Ali Karimi's teammate in Bayern Munich / 2020[43]\u200f[44]\n\nAfter Karimi's position in support of the 2022 Iranian protests following the death of Mahsa Amini,[45] FC Bayern Munich announced on 5 November 2022 that \"due to concerns regarding the health condition of Ali Karimi and other Iranian players of Bayern Munich, we have long since been in touch with the German ambassador to Tehran. The club is aware of the current critical situation in Iran and is ready to provide any assistance in this matter\".[46]\n\nOn 3 July 2007, Karimi announced that he had signed a two-year deal with Qatar Sports Club. Karimi was believed to have signed a contract worth around \u00a33.2 million, with a clause allowing him to return to Europe at any time.[47]\n\nOn 13 July 2008, Karimi signed a two-year contract with Al-Sailiya that is said to be worth around \u00a34.7 million.[48]\n\nPersepolis' then chairman, Dariush Mostafavi, reached an agreement with Karimi after a one-hour-long telephone conversation. Persepolis had to pay Al-Sailiyah to release Karimi from his contract. Mostafavi claimed the release fee was around US$310,000. Karimi joined Persepolis on a loan,[49] and signed with Persepolis on a one-year contract on 6 September 2008.[citation needed]\n\nKarimi scored his first goal since his return to Persepolis in the Tehran derby. With Esteghlal leading 1\u20130, Karimi equalized for Persepolis two minutes from time.[50] On 9 October 2008, Karimi scored a hat trick against Abumoslem but could not prevent Persepolis losing 4\u20133.[51]\n\nHowever, Karimi's contract was not extended, reportedly because of a strained relationship with Persepolis chief executive Abbas Ansarifard.[citation needed] While Ansarifard claimed that the club offered Karimi a contract but he did not show up, Karimi claimed that Persepolis kept him waiting for four weeks for nothing.[citation needed]\n\nKarimi joined newly promoted Steel Azin on 29 July 2009 on a one-year deal. He was reportedly to be paid US$400,000 for the season.[52]\n\nAfter joining Steel Azin, Karimi scored for four consecutive matches at the start of the season. On 14 August 2009, he scored the second goal in Steel Azin's 4\u20133 win over Saba.[citation needed] He scored a brace against Shahin in Steel Azin's 2\u20131 victory.[53] On 4 December 2009, Karimi converted a penalty in the 52nd minute against Pas FC to score his 11th goal of the season.[citation needed] On 6 March 2010, during his team's match against Saipa, Karimi was sent off for pushing Majid Ayoubi after Ayoubi had fouled him.[54]\n\nIn January 2010, it was reported that Al-Ahli made an offer of US$500,000 to sign Karimi on a loan deal until the end of the 2009\u201310 season, which was rejected by Steel Azin.[55]\n\nKarimi was sacked by the club in August 2010 for failure to observe the requirement to fast during Ramadan, but was reinstated a few days later after paying a fine. The player maintained that he had not shown disrespect to Islam.[56]\n\nKarimi signed a five-month deal for Schalke on 31 January 2011 upon passing a medical examination.[57][58] He made his first appearance for the German club on 5 April 2011, coming on for Ra\u00fal in the second half in a Champions League quarter final match against Inter Milan before coming on as substitute against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the German Bundesliga in his second and final match for Schalke. He won the German cup for the second time before the end of his contract.\n\nOn 15 June 2011, Persepolis chairman Habib Kashani announced that they reached an agreement with Karimi and he played for Persepolis in the 2011\u201312 Persian Gulf Cup and the 2011\u201312 Hazfi Cup.[59] This was the second time that Karimi returned to his native club, Persepolis. Karimi was also appointed as Club captain. He made his debut in a match against Malavan and scored his first goal in the season for Persepolis in a match against Shahrdari Tabriz. He extended his contract with Persepolis for another season on 18 June 2012. He was injured a few times during the season and was not able to perform very well and at the end of the season he announced his retirement from football.\n\nOn 13 June 2013, Karimi returned from retirement and joined Tractor Sazi signing a one-year contract with Tractor Sazi. He made his first appearance for Tractor Sazi in Iran Pro League against former club Persepolis. Karimi scored his first goal in the Iran Pro League in Tractor's 4\u20132 win over Zob Ahan. He helped Tractor to win the season's Hazfi Cup, his first title in Iranian football after his return from European Football.\n\nOn 20 July 2014, Karimi announced his retirement through publishing a letter on his YouTube account.[60][61] At the time, Karimi was aged 35 and played professional football for 18 years.\n\nKarimi made his debut for Iran national team in October 1998 in a match against Kuwait.[62] That same year, he won the Gold Medal with Iran at the 1998 Asian Games. Karimi scored one of Iran's two goals in the final against Kuwait.\n\nHe was also one of Iran's main players in its 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. In 2001, after losing to Bahrain and drawing with Thailand, Iran finished second in their qualifying group and had to play a home-and-away play-off with the Republic of Ireland for a spot at the 2002 World Cup. Karimi started as an attacking midfielder in the first game in Dublin, and used his acceleration on the break and his dribbling to attack Ireland's defence. However, he was also off target on a number of occasions, and Iran lost the match 2\u20130. They won the return leg 1\u20130 but missed out on the final.[63]\n\nAt the 2004 Asian Cup, Karimi scored five goals that made him joint top scorer. Iran finished third in the overall tournament, behind Japan and China. In the quarter final, Karimi scored a hat trick in Iran's 4\u20133 win over South Korea.[63] Karimi was given the prestigious Asian Player of the Year award in 2004, joining his fellow Iranians, Mahdavikia in 2003, Ali Daei in 1999, and Khodadad Azizi in 1996.[64] He also won the 2004 West Asian Football Federation Championship with Team Melli.\n\nHis performance in the Iran\u2013Germany friendly game for Bam victims held in Azadi Stadium in Tehran in October 2004 was said to be the reason behind Bayern's interest in the player.\n\nComing off a serious ankle injury, Karimi had a poor World Cup finals at Germany 2006.[65] He was unable to exert much influence on proceedings as the Iranians lost 3\u20131 to Mexico and 2\u20130 to Portugal. He was substituted in the 65th minute of the Portugal game and kicked the team's sports bags by the dugout. Iran's then manager Branko Ivankovic said he may drop Karimi in the upcoming game due to disciplinary reasons.[66] Karimi did not play in the 1\u20131 draw against Angola, but Ivankovic attributed Karimi's omission to his refusal to play because of an injury.[67]\n\nKarimi played in the 2007 Asian Cup. In May 2008, Karimi was banned from playing in the national team after he made criticisms towards the IRIFF in the Ardebil training ground,[68] but was reinstated in the national squad after intervention from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.[69]\n\nIn October 2008, Karimi retired from Team Melli. Ali Daei, the then Iran football coach, said Karimi will never be called up again.[70] In April 2009, Karimi announced that he was ready again to serve his country, if he was to be picked by Team Melli coach, Afshin Ghotbi.\n\nHe played in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification for Iran and on 10 June 2009, Karimi scored in a 1\u20130 victory over U.A.E. to keep Iran's 2010 World Cup qualifying hopes alive. On 17 June 2009, he played in Iran's 1\u20131 draw with South Korea, a result that eliminated Iran from the 2010 World Cup finals. During the match, a number of Iranian players, including Karimi, wore green wristbands, which were interpreted to be a show of support for Iranian opposition leader Hossein Mousavi, who accused the Iranian government of vote rigging the election on 12 June. Western media reported after the game that the players who wore the green wristbands had been banned from the team for life, while a newspaper in Iran reported that the players concerned had retired.[71] On 24 June 2009, FIFA wrote to Iran's football federation asking for clarification on the situation. The Iranian football federation replied that no disciplinary action had been taken against any player.[72] On 3 March 2010, he returned for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Thailand.[73]\n\nHe was invited to the national football team again by Carlos Queiroz in 2011 to play in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification and played for the team until his retirement in 2013. Queiroz later announced that Karimi is one of his best players during his coaching times. He is currently the third most capped player and the third highest scorer of Iran.\n\nKarimi's most famous football feature is his dribbling skills.[24] In 2003, World Soccer described him as a player with \"hypnotic movements and ball work\".[17] In 2004, kicker magazine called Karimi the \"Maradona of Asia\" in a report: \"He shoots well with both feet, changes direction very quickly and is a player who makes the opposing team dizzy.\"[11]\n\n\"Ali Karimi made us dizzy with his technique in the friendly match of 2004 (Iran 0 - Germany 2)\"\n\nPer Mertesacker's memory of the friendly match between Iran and Germany/2004[74]\n\nDuring the coaching of Branko Ivankovic, when the Iran national team usually played with a 4-2-3-1 formation, Karimi played mostly in the attacking midfield position. FIFA magazine described Karimi as a professional playmaker in the April 2006 issue.[75]\n\nAccording to FIFA in 2009, Karimi's \"stunning dribbles\" are one of the characteristics of Karimi's game, and because of this, he is known as \"Magician\".[12]\n\nIn a report in 2017, AFC called Karimi the \"Maradona of Asia\" and introduced him as \"one of the Icons of Asian football history\". In the continuation of this report, \"magical dribbling skills\" and \"a knack for the unpredictable\" are mentioned as characteristics of Karimi's game.[14]\n\nOn 25 September 2014, Karimi was named as the assistant coach by Carlos Queiroz in the Iranian national team.[76] However, he stepped down from his role shortly before the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. Later in June 2017, he was appointed Naft Tehran manager, but has not signed a contract with the team and left the team before the start of the league. However, Karimi was resigned with Naft in September. On 1 January 2018, he became the head coach of Sepidrood while Sepidrood was in bottom two but he kept this team in the Persian Gulf Pro League.\n\nAli Karimi married Sahar Davari in 1999, at the age of 21. The couple have a daughter named Hima and two sons named Hawsh and Hirsa.[77]\n\nKarimi publicly supported the Mahsa Amini protests against the government of Iran in late 2022. He posted on Instagram that not even holy water could \"wash away this disgrace\" of Amini's death.[78] In addition to his criticism of the government, he used his platform of 14+ million followers to advise Iranians on how to bypass Internet censorship in their country.[79] Based in Dubai, he was charged in absentia by Iran with \"encouraging riots\",[80] and his house in Lavasan was seized by the Iranian state.[79]\n\nOn 21 December 2022, after Karimi's meeting with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, Steinmeier emphasized his support for the Iranian protesters.[81]\n\nOn January 18, 2023, Karimi publicly tweeted his support for exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi to assume a role as representative of the Iranian people pending a national referendum.[82]\n\nPersepolis\n\nAl-Ahli\n\nBayern Munich\n\nSchalke 04\n\nTractor Sazi\n\nIran\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Karimi"}, {"id": 7, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/22/429386/original/alex-mcleish-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Alex McLeish", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/alex-mcleish/429386", "desc": "Alexander McLeish (born 21 January 1959) is a Scottish football player and coach.

McLeish spent ten months as manager of the Scotland national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the 2008 UEFA European championship. He then resigned this post in November 2007 to become manager of Birmingham City, who were in the Premier League at the time. Though Birmingham were relegated at the end of the season, McLeish guided them back to the Premier League in 2009. Birmingham then won the 2011 Football League Cup Final, but were relegated again from the Premier League at the end of the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nFollowing this relegation he resigned his post at Birmingham to become manager at their city rivals, Aston Villa. This made him the first manager to move directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa, and only the second manager after Ron Saunders to manage both clubs. Having only narrowly avoided relegation in the 2011\u201312 Premier League season, his contract was terminated by Villa at the end of his first season. McLeish was appointed manager of Championship club Nottingham Forest in December 2012, but left after 40 days by mutual consent.[5] He managed Belgian Pro League club Genk in the 2014\u201315 season, and Zamalek of the Egyptian Premier League in 2016. He then had a second stint as Scotland national team manager.\n\nIn recognition of his distinguished service to Scottish sport, in 2008 McLeish was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen.[6]\n\nMcLeish was born in Duke Street Hospital, Glasgow to parents Alex, a shipyard worker, and Jean.[7] He has younger siblings Angela and Ian. After living in the Parkhead and Kinning Park districts of the city, the family moved to Barrhead, Renfrewshire soon after McLeish had reached school age. He attended Springhill Primary, Barrhead High School \u2013 where he was one year below future Aberdeen and Scotland teammate Peter Weir \u2013 and John Neilson High School in Paisley.[7]\n\nAs a juvenile he played for Barrhead Youth Club, alongside Weir, and Glasgow United as well as training for a short period with Hamilton Accies. After a local cup final with Glasgow United in 1976 which was watched by a delegation from Aberdeen, including then manager Ally MacLeod, McLeish signed for the Pittodrie club the following day.[7]\n\nMcLeish spent the majority of his first two seasons at Aberdeen in the reserves and also had a loan spell at local Junior side Lewis United.[8] He made his competitive debut under Billy McNeill in a New Year fixture against Dundee United on 2 January 1978.[7] His first major final appearance was under the management of Alex Ferguson as a substitute in a 2\u20131 defeat to Rangers in the 1978\u201379 League Cup and most of his appearances during the 1970s were as a midfielder, with Willie Garner and Doug Rougvie preferred in defence.[8] However McLeish eventually made the centre-back position his own, and over the next seven seasons he enjoyed great success, winning eight domestic and two European trophies. Highlights included scoring in a 4\u20131 victory over Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup Final on his 200th Dons appearance, and a vital goal against Bayern Munich during the campaign leading to the European Cup Winners' Cup win over Real Madrid in 1983.[9][10]\n\nDuring this period, McLeish formed a formidable defensive triumvirate with Willie Miller and Jim Leighton for both club and country.[11] Even after he had won his first Scotland cap, McLeish's father asked then Aberdeen boss Alex Ferguson to persuade him to continue training as an accountant. When Ferguson left in 1986 to go to Manchester United, he tried to get McLeish to sign, but it did not work out; he also had talks with Tottenham Hotspur. A testimonial match was arranged for McLeish in December 1988, with the club's 'Gothenburg' (Cup Winners' Cup) squad taking on an 'International legends' team.[12][13] He won the Scottish player of the year in 1990,[9] after a season in which Aberdeen won both domestic cups.\n\nHe became captain of Aberdeen after the retirement of Willie Miller. His 692 competitive appearances for the club ranks as the second-most in its history (100 behind Miller, but almost 100 more than Bobby Clark).\n\nMcLeish is Scotland's third most capped player, having gained 77 international caps between 1980 and 1993.[14] He was first capped for the Scotland under-21 team while still a reserve player at Aberdeen by his former club manager Ally MacLeod, eventually gaining six caps at that level. His full international debut came on 26 March 1980 against Portugal, manager Jock Stein playing him in midfield alongside Archie Gemmill and Graeme Souness.[7] He played in three World Cups with Scotland, in 1982, 1986 and 1990.[9] He is a member of the Scottish Football Hall of Fame, the Scotland national football team roll of honour[14] and Scottish Television's fan poll Scotland's Greatest Team.[15] On the occasion of his 50th cap, against Luxembourg in 1987, McLeish was appointed team captain for the game.[7] His final cap came on 17 February 1993 in a 3\u20130 win over Malta at Hampden Park during the 1994 World Cup qualifiers.[16]\n\nAfter his successful playing career he quickly went into football management with Motherwell in 1994, one year before he retired as a player.[9] His first season at Motherwell saw him take the Lanarkshire club to second in the Premier Division behind Walter Smith's Rangers.[9] However, he failed to build on this success and the next two seasons were spent in relegation battles. He resigned as manager to take over at Hibernian in 1998.[9]\n\nMcLeish took over a struggling Hibernian side, which was relegated from the Scottish Premier Division in 1998 despite a slight upturn in fortunes under McLeish. He then guided the Edinburgh team back to the Scottish Premier League at the first attempt by winning the First Division championship.[9]\n\nHibernian consolidated in their first season back in the top division, finishing mid-table and reaching the Scottish Cup semi-final.[9] In the 2000\u201301 season, Hibs started very strongly. Eventually they had to settle for third place and a Scottish Cup final appearance.[9] This performance attracted the attention of bigger clubs, including West Ham United and Rangers.\n\nMcLeish attracted players such as Russell Latapy and former French international Franck Sauz\u00e9e to Hibs. He also helped develop young striker Kenny Miller, who would later go on to play for Scotland.\n\nDuring this period McLeish worked towards and was awarded a UEFA Pro Licence.[17][18]\n\nHis work at Hibs was noticed, and he was linked with several moves to England, before he was appointed as Rangers manager in December 2001[19] after outgoing Rangers manager Dick Advocaat recommended McLeish to chairman David Murray.[20]\n\nMcLeish was an instant success at Rangers, winning both the Scottish Cup[21] and Scottish League Cup[22] in his first season, but the big prize of the league title was essentially lost before his arrival. His second season saw him go one better when he won the domestic treble, with the help of players such as Ronald de Boer and Barry Ferguson.[23]\n\nRangers' worsening financial state saw many of his top players leave in the summer of 2003. Celtic won the league comfortably in season 2003\u201304, and Rangers failed to win any trophies.[24] McLeish was consequently put under pressure from fans after his poor signings and a record run of seven consecutive Old Firm derby losses to Celtic.[25]\n\nThe high-profile Bosman signings of Jean-Alain Boumsong and Dado Pr\u0161o in the close season of 2004\u201305 gave Rangers renewed hope of regaining the title from Celtic's grasp.[26] McLeish's team won the 2005 league title on a dramatic last day, an outcome that had looked highly unlikely after Rangers fell five points behind leaders Celtic with just four games remaining.[27]\n\nAfter this unexpected success, McLeish and his Rangers team headed into the 2005\u201306 SPL campaign as favourites to retain the championship. McLeish made a number of signings, including Julien Rodriguez and Ian Murray, despite having little money to spend. After a reasonable start to the season, including a win over Celtic,[28] Rangers suffered a series of poor results between September and November. This period included a club record of 10 games without a win. However the tenth match of this run, a 1\u20131 draw with Inter Milan in the Champions League, took Rangers into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time.[29]\n\nDespite the poor domestic form, McLeish guided Rangers to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they were defeated on the away goals rule by Villarreal.[30] They became the first Scottish team to progress this far in the European Cup since 1993, and the first Scottish team to progress through a European group stage.[29] In December, chairman David Murray publicly announced his support for McLeish.[31] Rangers then went on a good run of results in December and January.\n\nThis run of good results came to a sudden halt when they were defeated 3\u20130 by Hibernian in the Scottish Cup,[32] prompting protests outside Ibrox against both McLeish and David Murray.[33] On 9 February 2006, it was announced by chairman David Murray that McLeish would be standing down as manager at the end of that season.[34]\n\nIt was later announced that he would be succeeded by former Olympique Lyonnais manager Paul Le Guen. Rangers beat Hearts 2\u20130 at Ibrox Stadium in his final match as manager.[35]\n\nMcLeish said after leaving Rangers that he would not manage another Scottish club, because he felt that he had achieved everything in the Scottish game.[36] He was linked in the media with a number of managerial positions in England while he worked as a television pundit for the BBC and Setanta Sports.\n\nMcLeish took charge of the Scotland national team on 29 January 2007.[37] His assistants in the job were Roy Aitken and Andy Watson.\nMcLeish's first game in charge of the national team was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match, a 2\u20131 victory against Georgia on 24 March 2007 at Hampden Park.[38] His second game was an away fixture against Italy on 28 March 2007 which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat.[39]\n\nMcLeish's Scotland side then went on to defeat the Faroe Islands away in June,[40] Lithuania at home in September[41] before recording a historic victory in Paris four days later by defeating France 1\u20130 in the Parc des Princes.[42] James McFadden's 64th-minute strike from 30 yards was enough to earn Scotland the win and returned them to the top of Group B with three games to play. This result has been hailed as one of the Scotland national team's greatest victories.[43] Scotland's next success was at home to Ukraine, winning 3\u20131 at Hampden on 13 October. McLeish suffered his second defeat as manager, away in Georgia on 17 October. This result left Scotland facing a decider against the World Champions, Italy. Scotland lost the game 2\u20131, McLeish's last, and Italy qualified for the finals.\n\nPremier League club Birmingham City's approach to the SFA for permission to speak to McLeish about their managerial vacancy was refused,[44]\nbut on his return on 27 November 2007 from attending the draw for 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification in South Africa, he resigned his post as manager of Scotland[45] and was announced as Birmingham's new manager the following day. His assistants with Scotland, Roy Aitken and Andy Watson, were to accompany him. McLeish said he wanted to return to working with players on a daily basis and had \"always harboured a desire\" to manage in the Premier League.[46]\n\nHe enjoyed a positive managerial debut with Birmingham, winning 3\u20132 away to Tottenham Hotspur.[47] In the January 2008 transfer window, McLeish strengthened Birmingham's squad, buying David Murphy and James McFadden and signing Argentina under-20 international Mauro Z\u00e1rate on loan, while generating funds by allowing fringe players to leave.[48] He was unable to save Birmingham from relegation, despite the team recording an impressive 4\u20131 victory over Blackburn Rovers on the last day of the season.[49]\n\nMcLeish changed the club's backroom staff and training procedures, appointed David Watson as goalkeeping coach, and overhauled the scouting setup, bringing in Paul Montgomery \u2013 the scout who recommended a relatively unknown Didier Drogba to West Ham United \u2013 to oversee player recruitment.[50]\n\nOn the final day of the 2008\u201309 season, McLeish secured Birmingham's return to the top flight of English football at the first attempt with a 2\u20131 away victory over Reading.[51] By mid-January 2010, he had guided them to a 12-game unbeaten run, a club record in the top division,[52] set a Premier League record by selecting the same starting eleven for nine consecutive games,[53] and been named Premier League Manager of the Month for December 2009, the first Birmingham manager to receive the award.[54] By the end of the season McLeish had led Birmingham to ninth place, their highest finish for more than 50 years.[55]\n\nFollowing Birmingham's success during the 2009\u201310 season, McLeish agreed a new three-year deal with the club in September 2010.[56]\nIn February 2011, McLeish led Birmingham to victory in the League Cup, defeating favourites Arsenal 2\u20131 in the final at Wembley in what he described as \"relatively speaking,\u00a0... [his] greatest achievement\".[57]\nHowever, a poor run of form followed the League Cup win, and Birmingham were relegated to the Championship on the last day of the 2010\u201311 season.[58][59] The directors confirmed that McLeish would keep his job, and would be expected to return the club to the Premier League at the first opportunity.[60] McLeish however opted to quit Birmingham City on 12 June 2011 by email.[61]\n\nOn 17 June 2011, Aston Villa appointed McLeish as manager, just five days after leaving their local rivals Birmingham City.[62] There was much controversy surrounding his appointment as Birmingham City claimed McLeish was still under contract and filed a complaint against Aston Villa to the Premier League while Villa claimed McLeish was a free agent.[63] Aston Villa fans protested outside Villa Park and anti-McLeish graffiti had to be removed from outside Villa's training ground.[64] McLeish made out of favour Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given his first signing,[65] and then recruited winger Charles N'Zogbia.[66] McLeish's first competitive game as Villa manager ended in a 0\u20130 draw with Fulham at Craven Cottage.[67] He gained his first Premier League win as manager of Villa in a 3\u20131 win over Blackburn Rovers. Following victory over Blackburn, Villa drew their next four Premier League games until winning against Wigan 2\u20130.[68] Aston Villa finally ended their unbeaten start with a 4\u20131 defeat away at Manchester City. McLeish's side secured a surprise win over Chelsea just before signing LA Galaxy striker Robbie Keane on loan.[69] Keane helped to secure Villa a crucial win against rivals Wolves in a 3\u20132 victory. McLeish led the 2011\u201312 Villa team to 16th place in the Premier League, avoiding relegation by two points, and set an unwanted club record of only four home wins.[70] McLeish's contract was terminated on 14 May, the day after the season ended. The reasons cited for his termination were the poor results and style of play used throughout his term as manager.[71]\n\nMcLeish was appointed manager of Football League Championship club Nottingham Forest on 27 December 2012.[72] His first game in charge was on 29 December 2012, a 2\u20132 draw against Crystal Palace at the City Ground, with Billy Sharp scoring an injury-time equaliser for Nottingham Forest.[73] McLeish earned his first win as Nottingham Forest manager on 12 January 2013, a 2\u20131 victory against Peterborough at home.[74] McLeish took charge of his only East Midlands derby against Derby County on 19 January 2013, drawing 1\u20131 at Pride Park.[75]\n\nOn 2 February 2013, after a 2\u20131 defeat to former club Birmingham City on his first return to St Andrew's, he refused to commit his future to Nottingham Forest and claimed he was unhappy. This came after the Nottingham Forest board pulled out of a deal to sign George Boyd on the final day of the January transfer window.[76] On 5 February 2013, he left the club by mutual consent.[77]\n\nMcLeish stated in November 2013 that he would like to re-enter football management in some capacity, in England, Scotland or abroad.[78] In August 2014, he was appointed manager of Belgian club Genk.[79] McLeish made his managerial debut on 30 August, in which Genk drew Oostende 1\u20131 away.[80] It was reported in March 2015 that McLeish would leave Genk at the end of the 2014\u201315 Belgian Pro League season, as the club had failed to qualify for the Championship play-offs, although they did reach Europa League play-offs.[81]\n\nMcLeish was appointed manager of Egyptian Premier League club Zamalek on 28 February 2016.[82] After a series of poor performances from the team, he was sacked on 2 May with ten matches of the season remaining.[83]\n\nMcLeish was reappointed Scotland manager on 16 February 2018, on a two-year contract.[84] Scotland won their 2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League group under McLeish, but he was sacked on 18 April 2019 following a 3\u20130 defeat by Kazakhstan.[85]\n\nMcLeish had a cameo appearance in the Laurel and Hardy biopic Stan & Ollie, after a chance meeting with director and Aberdeen FC fan Jon S. Baird on a flight. In the film, McLeish can be briefly seen reading a newspaper in the lobby of the Savoy Hotel behind Steve Coogan.[86][87]\n\nDuring the 2014 Scottish independence referendum McLeish was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.[88]\n\nAberdeen\n\nIndividual\n\nHibernian\n\nRangers\n\nBirmingham City\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_McLeish"}, {"id": 8, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/79/1572535/original/michael-ballack-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Michael Ballack", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/michael-ballack/1572535", "desc": "Michael Ballack (German pronunciation: [\u02c8m\u026a\u00e7a\u02d0\u0294e\u02d0l \u02c8balak]; born 26 September 1976) is a German retired footballer.

He is among the top goal scorers in the history of the Germany national team. Ballack wore the number 13 shirt for every team he has played for, except  1. FC Kaiserslautern. He was selected by Pel\u00e9 as one of FIFA's 100 Greatest Living Players, and as the UEFA Club Midfielder of the Year in 2002. He won the German Footballer of the Year award three times \u2013 in 2002, 2003 and 2005. Ballack was known for his passing range, powerful shot, physical strength and commanding presence in midfield.[3][4]\n\nBallack began his career as a youth at enterprise sports community BSG Motor \"Fritz Heckert\" Karl-Marx-Stadt in 1983. He then joined the youth department of football club FC Karl-Marx-Stadt.[5] Ballack made his debut for Germany's under-21 side on 26 March 1996. Although the team were relegated in his first season, his performances in the Regionalliga the following season led to a transfer to 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 1997. He won the Bundesliga in his first season at the club, his first major honour. He became a first team regular in 1998\u201399 season and also earned his first senior national cap for Germany. He moved to Bayer Leverkusen for \u20ac4.1\u00a0million in 1999. The 2001\u201302 season saw him win a slew of runners-up medals: Bayer Leverkusen finished second in the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, UEFA Champions League and Germany lost to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup Final.\n\nA \u20ac12.9\u00a0million move to Bayern Munich led to further honours: the team won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2003, 2005 and 2006. Ballack had become a prolific goalscorer from midfield, scoring 58 goals for Bayern between 2002 and 2006. He joined Premier League club Chelsea in mid-2006 and won English honours in his first season at the club. Injury ruled him out of much of 2007, but he returned the following season to help Chelsea reach their first ever Champions League final. He also went on to win the FA Cup again in 2009 and then once more as part of a league and cup double in 2010.\n\nInternationally, Ballack has played in the UEFA European Football Championship in 2000, 2004 and 2008, and the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and 2006. J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann appointed him captain of the national team in 2004. Ballack scored consecutive game-winning goals in the quarter-final and semi-final to help his country to the 2002 World Cup final and led his team to the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup and the Euro 2008 final.\n\nBallack was born on 26 September 1976 in G\u00f6rlitz,[6] a town in Bezirk Dresden, East Germany (now Saxony, Germany). He is the only child of Stephan Ballack, an engineer, and his wife Karin, a secretary. The family moved to Chemnitz (then called Karl-Marx-Stadt) when Ballack was very young and it was there that he started to play football. He first began playing football for sports community.\n\nBallack's parents sent him to train with sports community BSG Motor \"Fritz Heckert\" Karl-Marx-Stadt at the age of seven. Ballack was praised by coach Steffen H\u00e4nisch. H\u00e4nisch was particularly impressed  by the well-developed technique for Ballack's age and his ability to shoot with both feet. Ballack was then allowed to attend the elite Children and Youth Sports School (KSJ) \"Emil Wallner\" in Karl-Marx-Stadt.[7] He then joined the larger and more promoted football club FC Karl-Marx-Stadt (renamed Chemnitzer FC in 1990) in 1988. The father of Ballack had played second-division football himself in Germany. \n\nIn 1995, Ballack earned his first professional contract, thanks to his performances in the role of central midfielder. He was dubbed the \"Little Kaiser\", in reference to Franz Beckenbauer, who was nicknamed \"Der Kaiser\". His professional debut came on 4 August 1995, on the first day of the new 2. Bundesliga season. Chemnitz lost the game 2\u20131, against VfB Leipzig.[8] At the end of the season, during which Ballack made 15 appearances, Chemnitz were relegated to the multi-tiered, regional third division.[5] The following season, Ballack became a regular first-team player as Chemnitz missed out on an immediate return to the Bundesliga. He did not miss a game and scored ten goals for the \"Sky Blues\". It was not enough for Chemnitz to be promoted, but in the summer of 1997, coach Otto Rehhagel of just-promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern signed Ballack at their return to top flight football.[6]\n\nIt was during the seventh match of the 1997\u201398 Bundesliga season, away to Karlsruhe, that Rehhagel decided to give Ballack his first Bundesliga appearance, substituting him onto the field for the final five minutes of the encounter.[9] On 28 March 1998, Ballack made his first-team debut-start against Bayer Leverkusen.[10]\n\nBallack made 16 appearances for his new team during the season as the club became the first-ever newly promoted team to lift the Bundesliga title.[6] In the following season, Ballack became both a regular member of the team (he made 30 appearances, scoring 4 goals in the league) and one of the side's leading players. Kaiserslautern reached the quarter finals of the Champions League, but were eliminated by Bayern Munich.[11]\n\nOn 1 July 1999, Ballack moved to Bayer Leverkusen at age 22 for a transfer fee of \u20ac4.1\u00a0million.\n\nIt was at Bayer Leverkusen that Ballack made his breakthrough. Coaches Christoph Daum and Klaus Toppm\u00f6ller granted him an attacking role in the midfield. Ballack was instrumental to the success of Leverkusen, scoring 27 goals in the league[5] and nine in Europe over the course of his three seasons at the BayArena.\n\nIn 2000, Bayer Leverkusen needed only a draw against minnows SpVgg Unterhaching to win the Bundesliga title, but an own goal by Ballack helped send the team to a crushing 0\u20132 defeat,[12] while Bayern Munich clinched the title with a 3\u20131 victory over Werder Bremen.[13] The 2001\u201302 season was a disappointing one for Bayer Leverkusen. In the Bundesliga, the team surrendered a five-point lead at the top of the table over the last three games of the season to finish second behind Borussia Dortmund; lost the UEFA Champions League final 2\u20131 to Real Madrid; and lost the DFB-Pokal final 4\u20132 to Schalke 04. These three runner-up finishes were dubbed a \"Treble Horror\": Bayer Leverkusen was dubbed \"Bayer Neverkusen\" in English, while the German nickname became Vizekusen.[6] Ballack and Leverkusen teammates Bernd Schneider, Carsten Ramelow and Oliver Neuville were also beaten finalists with Germany in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, although Ballack was suspended for the final itself. Ballack finished with 17 league goals and his performance over the season led to him being voted into the UEFA.com users' Team of 2002 as well as being named German Footballer of the Year.\n\nIn spite of Real Madrid's interest, Ballack decided to sign with Bayern Munich in a \u20ac12.9\u00a0million deal in 2002 after his impressive performances in the World Cup. In his first season with the club, Bayern won the Bundesliga with 75 points as well as the DFB-Pokal, with Ballack scoring twice and defeating former club 1. FC Kaiserslautern in the latter's final.[14] In his second season, however, Bayern lost both their Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal crowns to Werder Bremen.\n\nIn his third season with the Bavarians, Ballack enjoyed success in the 2004\u201305 season as Bayern Munich completed another double. New coach Felix Magath stated he was the only automatic starter in their midfield.[15] In four seasons at Bayern, Ballack won three Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal doubles, scoring 44 goals in 107 Bundesliga matches.[16] Between 1998 and 2005, Ballack scored 61 goals in total in the domestic league.[5]\n\nBallack's critics, however, noted his frequent \"choking\" in important Champions League matches. This resulted in open public criticism from club general manager Uli Hoene\u00df, communications director Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and club president Franz Beckenbauer, all former Bayern players. Beckenbauer later went as far as to accuse Ballack of \"saving his strength\" for prospective employers after Ballack turned in an average performance in the 2006 DFB-Pokal final against Eintracht Frankfurt.[17]\n\nBallack agreed to join English Premier League club Chelsea on a free transfer on 15 May 2006.[18] During his last season with Bayern, there were rumours of interest from Manchester United, Real Madrid, Internazionale and Milan,[19] but Ballack instead chose to go to Stamford Bridge. Shortly after arriving at Chelsea, Ballack stated that he hoped to end his career at Chelsea.[20]\n\nBallack's debut for Chelsea came on 31 July 2006, during a practice match at UCLA's intramural football pitch. Chelsea presented him to the media the following day where the club also gave him his favoured number 13 shirt, worn throughout his career. Upon doing so, William Gallas, who previously wore the number 13 shirt for Chelsea, was given the number 3 shirt. This move created animosity between Gallas and the club as Gallas felt that he was underappreciated.[21] On 27 August 2006, Ballack made his Premier League debut for Chelsea against Blackburn Rovers. On 12 September, he scored his first goal for the club on his Champions League debut against Werder Bremen.\n\nHe received the first straight red card of his career in Chelsea's 1\u20130 win over Liverpool on 17 September 2006, after being judged to have stamped on Mohamed Sissoko's leg.[22] Ballack scored his first Premier League goal on 21 October 2006 against Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge with a header. His first FA Cup goal came in the 109th minute in the semi-final against Blackburn on 15 April 2007. This goal resulted in Chelsea progressing into the FA Cup final. He scored eight goals in all competitions for the club in the 2006\u201307 season, including a free-kick against Everton at Goodison Park, as well as a half-volley against Porto which sent Chelsea through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Throughout his first season at Chelsea, Ballack was criticised for his lethargic performances \u2013 for playing as though he had \"a huge cigar in his mouth\".[23]\n\nOn 29 April 2007, Chelsea released a statement on their official website, informing fans that Ballack had undergone ankle surgery in Munich.[24] As a result, Ballack did not play in the FA Cup final against Manchester United, which Chelsea won 1\u20130 through Didier Drogba's extra time goal. This was Ballack's second trophy this season, his first being the League Cup, the final of which he started.\n\nDespite persistent rumours in the summer 2007 transfer window,[citation needed] Ballack denied that he wanted to leave[citation needed] and no such move materialised. Chelsea left Ballack out of their Champions League squad for the 2007\u201308 group stage as they realised that his injury would prevent him from playing any useful part and preferred to select the fully fit Steve Sidwell. The German international had an ankle operation in the summer and Chelsea could not take the risk of him not regaining full fitness before the end of the group stage. Thus, Ballack could not play in the Champions League before the knockout stages began in February.[25] The club was only able to select 23 out of a possible 25 players for their Champions League squad due to the new UEFA regulations on \"association-trained players\" and \"club-trained players\". Due to this regulation, Chelsea were also unable to select young player Scott Sinclair and could only pick 23 players as their only \"club-trained player\" was John Terry. For this reason, it was deemed unwise to gamble on Ballack being fit at some point.[26]\n\nBallack made his return to the side in Chelsea's 2\u20130 League Cup win over Liverpool on 19 December 2007. Ballack tallied an assist late in the game to striker Andriy Shevchenko. On 26 December 2007, Ballack made his Premier League return in a thrilling game against Aston Villa which ended 4\u20134. He came on for Frank Lampard in the 26th minute after the latter had picked up a thigh injury. In first-half stoppage time, he won a penalty after being brought down in the box by Zat Knight, which Andriy Shevchenko converted. In the 88th minute, with the score tied at 3\u20133, Ballack stepped up to take a free-kick, which he buried into the bottom left corner of the goal, but the match ended in a 4\u20134 draw.\n\nBallack captained the Chelsea team in the absence of captain John Terry and vice-captain Frank Lampard in a 2\u20131 win over Newcastle United on 29 December 2007. Ballack then played his 50th game in a Chelsea shirt in a 2\u20131 win against Fulham in which he scored the winning goal for Chelsea. He also scored the only goal that won the match for Chelsea against Reading to extend the blues' winning streak to a record of nine. And, on 5 March 2007, he scored again, this time against Olympiacos in the Champions League round of 16 in a 3\u20130 win. He scored the winning goal in the 2\u20130 win in the second leg of the quarter-finals against Fenerbah\u00e7e, a victory that secured Chelsea a place in the semi-finals.\n\nBallack continued to score vital goals and, on 26 April 2008, he scored a header and a penalty to give Chelsea a 2\u20131 win over Manchester United. He was named Man of The Match for his performance. It brought the two teams level in the race for the Premier League title only two matchdays before the end of the season.\n\nThe season ended on a low note for Ballack as Chelsea finished runners-up in the League Cup, Premier League and Champions League. This completed another treble horror for Ballack and his club. On 29 June 2008, Germany, captained by Ballack, lost to Spain 1\u20130 in the final of UEFA Euro 2008. This became the second season in Ballack's career after 2002 that he was runner-up for four major trophies.\n\nThe 2008\u201309 season started well for Ballack, as he set up Joe Cole to score the first goal in a 4\u20130 win over Portsmouth in the first game of the season. Ballack was injured shortly after missing the games against Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Ballack's return from injury has been a lift for Chelsea as he set up Deco to score a scissor kick in a 2\u20130 win against Bolton Wanderers. Ballack's first goal of the '09 season came against Southend United in their FA Cup replay, a match which Chelsea went on to win 4\u20131. Ballack's first Premier League goal of the 2008\u201309 season came on 11 April 2009 in a match against Bolton, ending 4\u20133 for Chelsea. He came on as a second-half substitute as Chelsea won the 2009 FA Cup final. On 2 June 2009, Ballack signed a one-year contract extension with Chelsea.[27]\n\nIn Chelsea's second game of the season, away at Sunderland, Ballack scored his first goal of the 2009\u201310 campaign in their 3\u20131 win. Ballack also scored against Burnley in a 3\u20130 win. Ballack made his first Champions League appearance for the season against Porto. On 20 September 2009, he scored his third league goal, against Tottenham. On 17 January 2010, he scored his fourth league goal and third assist in a 7\u20132 win against Sunderland. In Chelsea's fifth round FA Cup tie against Cardiff City, Ballack scored the goal which put the Blues back in front; Chelsea ultimately won 4\u20131.\n\nBallack was sent off in Chelsea's 4\u20132 defeat against Manchester City on 27 February 2010.[28] Chelsea went on to win the 2009\u201310 Premier League, Ballack's first league title in England.[29] He also started as Chelsea were victorious against Portsmouth in the 2010 FA Cup final, however he would come off injured shortly before half-time after a tackle by Kevin-Prince Boateng. As a result of the injury, Ballack was not able to participate in the 2010 World Cup.[6][30]\n\nOn 9 June 2010, it was announced that Ballack, along with teammates Joe Cole and Juliano Belletti, would leave Chelsea on a free transfer after his contract was not renewed.[31] It was reported that while manager Carlo Ancelotti wanted to retain Ballack, club owner Roman Abramovich was only willing to offer a one-year deal due to Ballack's age.[30] As of December 2012, Ballack had the lowest loss record of any player with more than 100 appearances in the Premier League, losing just 10 of his 105 appearances.[32]\n\nOn 25 June 2010, Ballack signed a two-year contract with former club Bayer Leverkusen.[33] On 19 August 2010, he scored the first goal for Leverkusen in a 3\u20130 win against Tavriya Simferopol in the UEFA Europa League qualifiers. On 6 October 2010, it was announced that Ballack would not play again in 2010 at the club or international level due to a shin injury sustained 11 September 2010 in a Bundesliga match against Hannover 96.\n\nOn 20 February 2011, Ballack made his return from injury, coming on as a substitute for Simon Rolfes against VfB Stuttgart; Leverkusen won the match 4\u20132. Ballack scored his second Europa League goal against Metalist Kharkiv, a match Leverkusen won 2\u20130 and the two-legged tie 6\u20130 on aggregate to progress to the round of 16.[34] Ballack played the full 90 minutes against Schalke 04, assisting Eren Derdiyok's goal in an eventual 2\u20130 victory.[35]\n\nBallack announced his retirement on 2 October 2012.[36][37] He had been in talks with Major League Soccer's Montreal Impact and A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers.[36]\n\nOn 5 June 2013, Ballack played a farewell match at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena. The match was won by a World XI 4\u20133 against the \"Friends of Ballack\", with Ballack scoring his second hat-trick in his career. First he scored two goals with \"Friends of Ballack\" in the first half and scored his third goal and the winner in the second half for the World XI. Participants in the match included former teammates and friends Lothar Matth\u00e4us, Didier Drogba, Miroslav Klose, Andriy Shevchenko, Phillip Lahm, Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107, Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Essien, Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, Ricardo Carvalho, Dietmar Hamann, Florent Malouda, Carsten Jancker, Torsten Frings, Jens Lehmann, Christian W\u00f6rns, Mehdi Mahdavikia and Per Mertesacker, as well as Formula 1 racing driver Michael Schumacher. The teams were coached by Ballack's former Chelsea coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and his former national team coach Rudi V\u00f6ller.[38]\n\nOn 26 March 1996, Ballack debuted for the Germany national under-21 team against Denmark, shortly after signing for Chemnitzer FC. In all, he played 19 matches for this side, scoring four goals. Then, following his move to 1. FC Kaiserslautern, senior team head coach Berti Vogts called him up to the squad.\n\nBallack's first senior Germany appearance, however, did not come until 28 April 1999, when he came on as a substitute for Dietmar Hamann in a match against Scotland.[39]\n\nBallack only played 63 minutes at UEFA Euro 2000. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he scored in matches against the United States and South Korea during the knockout rounds as Germany reached the final. However, he was booked for a tactical foul during the semi-final match against South Korea and was suspended for the final, which Germany went on to lose 2\u20130 to Brazil. He was included in the World Cup All Star Team. Ballack missing the final ultimately led to a lasting revision of the yellow card amnesty rule in order \"to give the best players a chance to play in the final\".[40] Following Euro 2004, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann replaced Rudi V\u00f6ller at the helm of the national team and Ballack took over from Oliver Kahn as captain. He scored three goals \u2014 all penalties \u2014 in the 2005 Confederations Cup, in which Germany were eliminated by Brazil in the semifinals.[41]\n\nIn the 2006 World Cup, he was unable to start in Germany's first game against Costa Rica due to a calf strain, but appeared in the following five matches. Germany were eliminated in the semi-finals, but they managed to clinch third place in a match against Portugal. He was named Man of the Match in the games against Ecuador and Argentina,[42] and was included in FIFA's World Cup All Star Team for a second consecutive time. After the tournmanent, Klinsmann stood down as national team head coach and was succeeded by assistant Joachim L\u00f6w.\n\nBallack started and captained Germany in their first game of Euro 2008 against Poland.[43] He proved to be an influential figure in the midfield as Germany came back from a shock defeat to Croatia to make it to the final, scoring a free kick against Austria to secure Germany a 1\u20130 win and a place in the quarter-finals.[44] In the quarter-finals, he scored a header against Portugal to make the score 3\u20131 in their 3\u20132 win after an assist by Bastian Schweinsteiger's 60th minute free-kick, helping Germany to advance to the semi-finals. Germany went on to beat Turkey 3\u20132 in the semifinals. Prior to the final, Ballack sustained a calf injury but eventually overcame it in time. Germany, however, ended up losing 1\u20130 to Spain. Nevertheless, he was named in the Squad of the Tournament.[45]\n\nBallack scored four goals in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, but missed the 2010 World Cup after suffering an ankle injury from a foul by Portsmouth's Kevin-Prince Boateng in the 2009-10 FA Cup final.[46] Ballack did travel to South Africa to provide moral support for the national team but he departed after Philipp Lahm, who was appointed team captain due to Ballack's injury, commented after the quarter-finals that he would not relinquish the captaincy back to Ballack. Team manager Oliver Bierhoff criticized Lahm's comments and clarified the situation, saying, \"Philipp Lahm is the World Cup captain and Michael Ballack is still the captain.\"[47]\n\nGermany played strongly in the tournament despite Ballack's absence, including a 4\u20131 win over England and a 4\u20130 win over Argentina en route to finishing third, thanks to emerging midfield talents such as Sami Khedira, Thomas M\u00fcller, and Mesut \u00d6zil.[48] Former German captain Lothar Matth\u00e4us suggested that Ballack's absence had allowed these young players to blossom.[49]\n\nSince the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Ballack had not been called up for any international matches. It was reported that Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w was waiting for Ballack to retire from international football after the 2010 World Cup, however Ballack refused to give up despite a rash of injuries suffered in 2010\u201311 with Bayer Leverkusen.[50] On 16 June 2011, it was announced that Ballack would no longer be a part of the national team. The German Football Association (DFB) offered him two friendlies to reach 100 matches for Germany, which he refused, accusing L\u00f6w of disrespecting him ever since his injury dating back to March 2010 and calling the invitation to compete in another two games for Germany a \"farce\".[51][52]\n\nBallack organized a farewell game by himself and invited Jogi L\u00f6w and Philipp Lahm. The teams on the pit were named Worldplayers vs. Ballack and Friends. Lahm played for 90 minutes. In attendance were Boris Becker, Michael Schumacher, Lothar Matth\u00e4us and Rudi V\u00f6ller.[53]\n\nBallack is considered to be one of the best and versatile midfielders of his generation;[54] he played in several midfield positions during his career, and was noted for his powerful shot with both feet.[3] Due to his tall frame, he was also known for his ability in the air, which made him a goal threat on set pieces.[55]\n\nOn a technical level, he was a commanding, physically strong and aggressive player, with excellent passing range, who moved the ball efficiently.[3] The technicality and intelligence of his game was extremely high. He started his football career as a sweeper,[56] but when he moved to Leverkusen in 1999, then-coach Christoph Daum moved him to midfield. He adapted to a deeper role during his spell at Chelsea.\n\nIn 2011, Ballack's international coach at the time, Joachim L\u00f6w, praised him, describing him as a player who \"exudes authority and calm on the pitch\".[57]\n\nBallack's surname is of Sorbian origin.[58] He was the only child of father Stephan, an engineer who played third-division football, and mother Karin, a secretary and swimmer.[59]\n\nOn 14 July 2008, Ballack married his long-time girlfriend Simone Lambe.[60] The couple had three children together: Louis (born 2001), Emilio (2002\u20132021), and Jordi (born 2005).[61] The couple divorced in 2012. He dated Natacha Tannous from 2015 to 2019.[62]\n\nDuring Euro 2012, the 2014 World Cup, and Euro 2016, Ballack worked as a studio analyst for ESPN, often alongside Alexi Lalas.[63]\n\nHis son, Emilio, died in a quad bike crash on 5 August 2021 at the age of 18.[64]\n\n1.

He was chairman of the AFL Commission (football's governing body) from 2007 to 2017.\n\nFitzpatrick was raised in Perth and began his football career with Subiaco in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). A ruckman, he played 97 games for the club between 1970 and 1974, playing in a premiership team in 1973 and winning the club's best and fairest award in his last two seasons. Fitzpatrick transferred to the Victorian Football League (VFL) for the 1975 season and represented Carlton until his retirement at the end of the 1983 season. He played in premierships in 1979, 1981, and 1982, and captained the club from 1980 to 1983. Fitzpatrick also represented both Western Australia and Victoria in interstate matches.\n\nA graduate of the University of Western Australia, Fitzpatrick interrupted his football career to study at St. John's College, Oxford, on a Rhodes Scholarship. After retiring from football he worked for the Victorian Treasury Department, and later worked in investment banking and funds management. Outside his commercial interests, Fitzpatrick served on the board of the Carlton Football Club from 1989 to 1995, and as chairman of the Australian Sports Commission from 1994 to 1997. \n\nFitzpatrick was born in Hastings, Victoria, but moved to Perth, Western Australia, at a young age.[1] He attended Churchlands Senior High School from 1966 to 1970 (including as head boy in his last year),[2] and went on to study at the University of Western Australia, graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1975.[3]\n\nFitzpatrick made his senior debut for Subiaco during the 1970 WANFL season, aged 17. He was 191 centimetres (6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) tall and 96 kilograms (212\u00a0lb) at his peak, and played as a ruckman.[4] During the 1973 season, Fitzpatrick represented Subiaco at the Championship of Australia, played in the grand final victory over West Perth (the club's first premiership since 1924), and was awarded the Outridge Medal as the club's best and fairest player. He won a second Outridge Medal in 1974, in both years finishing just ahead of Peter Featherby.[5] In total, Fitzpatrick played 97 games in his five seasons at Subiaco, kicking 77 goals.[4]\n\nHaving been targeted by Victorian recruiters for several years, Fitzpatrick transferred to Carlton for the 1975 VFL season. He played in all 24 of his team's matches and kicked 27 goals, including five against Collingwood in just his second game.[6] He finished equal eleventh in the Brownlow Medal, polling eleven votes.[7] After the end of the season, Fitzpatrick moved to England to study at St. John's College, Oxford, having been named Western Australia's 1975 Rhodes Scholar. He returned to Australia during the 1976 English summer and managed twelve further games for Carlton, but in 1977 did not play at all. After graduating from Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, Fitzpatrick resumed his football midway through the 1978 season, although he had time for only two games that year.[1]\n\nDuring the 1979 season, Fitzpatrick played every match for Carlton and kicked 36 goals, including four each in games against Geelong and Hawthorn.[6] He recorded 13 disposals, five marks, and 18 hit-outs in the grand final victory over Collingwood,[8] and at the end of the season was awarded the Robert Reynolds Trophy as Carlton's best and fairest player. Prior to the 1980 season, Fitzpatrick was appointed club captain in place of Peter Jones, who retired from playing in order to become head coach. The club lost consecutive finals in 1980, but subsequently won two premierships in two years, something they had not done since 1914/1915. Fitzpatrick was runner-up to Bruce Doull in the 1981 Norm Smith Medal and kicked two goals in the 1982 Grand Final. He missed several matches due to injury in 1983, and announced his retirement at the end of the season in order to concentrate on his business career.[9]\n\nFitzpatrick made his state debut for Western Australia at the 1972 Perth Carnival, aged 19, as a reserve for Bob Beecroft against Tasmania. He played his first full matches the following season, against Victoria at VFL Park and against South Australia at Subiaco Oval. He also played two state games in 1974, one of which was a narrow seven-point loss to Victoria in which he kicked two goals. After moving to the VFL in 1975, Fitzpatrick's appearances for Western Australia became less frequent. He returned to the state team for the 1979 Perth State of Origin Carnival (after five years' absence), and made an additional five appearances over the next three years.[10] In total, he played eleven matches for Western Australia between 1972 and 1982, kicking seven goals.[11] Fitzpatrick was also eligible to represent Victoria in some matches where state of origin rules had not yet been fully implemented. He played two interstate games for Victoria,[4] including one as captain in 1982.[12]\n\nAt the end of the 1983 season Fitzpatrick retired from football and began working as an adviser in the John Cain government's Victorian Treasury Department. His career then took him to New York where he worked for international investment banks Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston.\n\nIn 1994, he set up Hastings Funds Management, a successful superannuations funds company of which 51 per cent was sold to the Westpac in 2002.[13]\n\nPositions held were:\n\nIn 1996, Fitzpatrick bought a vineyard in Victoria's Yarra Valley, which he named 'Squitchy Lane' (after Squitchey Lane in Oxford, where he lived as a student and first became interested in wine).[16]\n\nFitzpatrick was appointed to the AFL Commission in 2003, and in 2007 replaced Ron Evans as its chairman. He retired from the position of chairman in April 2017 and was replaced by Richard Goyder.[17]\n\nHe was criticised for not being quick enough to condemn booing of Sydney Swans player Adam Goodes.[18]\n\nFitzpatrick was named in the Teams of the Century for both Subiaco and Carlton, including as captain of Subiaco.[4] He was an inaugural inductee into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2004.[19] In 2011, the University of Western Australia awarded Fitzpatrick an honorary degree, as Doctor of Letters.[3]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Fitzpatrick_(footballer)"}, {"id": 10, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/79/1575712/original/1575712-photo-u11?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Michael Owen", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/michael-owen/1575712", "desc": "Michael James Owen (born 14 December 1979) is an English former footballer who played as a striker for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City, as well as for the England national team.

Since retiring from football in 2013, he has become a racehorse breeder and owner and regularly features as a sports pundit and commentator.[4]\n\nThe son of former footballer Terry Owen, Owen was born in Chester and began his senior career at Liverpool in 1996. Displaying rapid pace and composed finishing, he progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his Premier League debut in May 1997, becoming the club's youngest goalscorer, at 17\u00a0years, 143\u00a0days.[5] In his first full season in the Premier League, Owen finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals, sharing the Premier League Golden Boot. He repeated this the following year and was Liverpool's top goal-scorer from 1997 to 2004, gaining his name as a proven goal-scorer despite suffering from a recurring hamstring injury. In 2001, Liverpool won a cup treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup (with Owen scoring two late goals in the final) and Football League Cup, and Owen was the recipient of the Ballon d'Or. He went on to score 118 goals in 216 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool, and 158 goals in 297 total appearances. Regarded as one of the greatest Liverpool players, Owen came 14th in the \"100 Players Who Shook The Kop\", an official Liverpool fan poll.[6] In 2004, Owen was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[7]\n\nAfter Liverpool had fallen behind their title rivals under G\u00e9rard Houllier's final two seasons, Owen opted not to renew his contract and then moved to Real Madrid for \u00a38\u00a0million in the summer of 2004. There he was frequently used as a substitute. He scored 13 goals in La Liga before returning to England the following season where he joined Newcastle United for \u00a316.8\u00a0million. This was after Owen's disappointment that Real had rejected a bid from Liverpool to re-sign him.[8][9] After a promising start to the 2005\u201306 season, injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return, he became team captain and was the team's top scorer for the 2007\u201308 season. Newcastle were relegated in the 2008\u201309 season and, in a surprise move, Owen moved to Manchester United as a free agent. He spent three years at Old Trafford before joining Stoke City in September 2012. Owen is one of ten players to have scored 150 or more goals in the Premier League.[10] He is also the youngest player to have reached 100 goals in the Premier League.[11] On 19 March 2013, Owen announced his retirement from playing at the end of the 2012\u201313 season.\n\nInternationally, Owen first played for the senior England team in 1998, becoming England's youngest player and youngest goalscorer at the time. His performance at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which included a goal against Argentina in which he ran from the halfway line, brought him to national and international prominence, making him one of the most sought after players in world football.[5] He went on to score in UEFA Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. He is the only player to have scored in four consecutive major tournaments for England. He played at the 2006 World Cup, but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from. Occasionally playing as captain, he is England's 11th-most-capped player and has scored a former national record (since overtaken by Wayne Rooney) of 26 competitive goals, with 40 in total from 89 appearances, most recently in 2008.[12]\n\nOwen was born in Chester, Cheshire, the fourth child of Jeanette and Terry Owen.[13] His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. Owen was introduced to football at the age of seven by his father who soon saw Michael as the most promising athlete in the family.[13] A boyhood Everton fan,[14] Owen attended Rector Drew Primary School in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales and by the age of ten, some of the nation's leading scouts were monitoring his progress.[15]\n\nAt eight, Owen was selected for the Deeside Area Primary School's Under-11 team. At nine, he was captain and at ten he had smashed Ian Rush's 20-year record for the same team by scoring 97 goals in a single season, improving on Rush's record by 25 goals.[16][17] Owen also broke Gary Speed's appearance record having played in all three seasons for the 11-year-olds since he was eight.[17] Owen turned out for the youth team of Mold Alexandra,[13] playing with the under-10s at the age of eight after a local physical education teacher, Howard Roberts, persuaded the league to allow an under-age player.[13] Owen scored on his debut for Mold Alexandra,[16] a 2\u20130 victory over local rivals Bagillt.[16] He went on to score 34 goals in 24 games in his first season with Mold Alexandra.[18] After leaving Deeside, Owen attended Hawarden High School, where he also played for the school team.[15]\n\nAt age 12, when Owen started attending secondary school, he became eligible to sign a schoolboy contract with a club. The first major club to spot him playing for Deeside was Liverpool. Brian Kidd came down from Manchester United and there was also interest from Chelsea and Arsenal. But Steve Heighway, the Liverpool youth development officer, wrote to Owen personally. Terry Owen stated: \"[Heighway] wrote us a smashing letter and it was love at first sight for Michael, he was impressed from day one.\"[17] Owen subsequently signed with the Liverpool youth team. The club then persuaded Owen to attend the FA's School of Excellence at Lilleshall in Shropshire at age 14. Owen was soon playing for England teams from under-15 upwards, breaking several scoring records with 28 goals in 20 games for the England u-15s and u-16s.[17] Owen also scored prolifically as he rose rapidly through the Anfield youth ranks.[19] Throughout this time, Owen had continued his studies and achieved ten GCSEs.[20] Despite the academic success,[20] Owen was adamant his future was a professional football career with Liverpool.[20]\n\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, Owen played for Liverpool's youth team even though he was still at Lilleshall. Most of the players were 18, but Owen was only 16.[17] He scored a hat-trick against FA Youth Cup holders Manchester United in the quarter-finals, scoring the winner in extra time.[17] Owen subsequently scored another hat-trick in a 4\u20132 win in the first leg of the semi against Crystal Palace. Liverpool were 3\u20130 down after only 50 minutes in the second leg,[17] but with Owen taking control of the match and scoring twice, the team ran out as 7\u20135 winners.[17] Liverpool faced West Ham United in the final, played over two legs as well. West Ham had not lost in 24 consecutive games,[17] and had future England stars Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard.[17] Owen missed the first leg at Upton Park as he was on tour duty with the England under-16 team in the European youth championship in Austria.[17] He returned for the second-leg where Liverpool had fallen behind early but Owen equalised with his eleventh goal in five cup matches and Liverpool won the match 2\u20131.[17] It was the first time Liverpool had won the FA Youth Cup in the club's history and Owen was widely considered the star of the FA Cup campaign.[17][19]\n\nOwen celebrated his 17th birthday by signing a professional contract with Liverpool. He was handed a place in Roy Evans' senior squad, with Steve Heighway stating that, \"[Owen] is ready for whatever you throw at him; nothing fazes Michael Owen. He's ready. If the manager wants a recommendation from me, Michael gets it.\"[21] Owen also declared his aim was \"a first-team place in the next year or so\".[17] Karl-Heinz Riedle, who prior to joining Liverpool in the summer of 1997 had never heard of Owen, declared, \"It's unbelievable when you see him play to realise that he's only 17,\" he said. \"He's such a good player, so very quick and for his age he has excellent vision and awareness. He's a great player already and in one or two years he will become a very great player.\"[17] Owen was rated as \"the best attacker of his age in the country\" in January 1997.[21] Ted Powell, the championship-winning coach of the England under-18 side, declared Owen to be the best of a generation of young players that included Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Robbie Fowler.[22]\n\nOn 6 May 1997, Owen scored on his Liverpool debut against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.[23] Liverpool were league title challengers to Manchester United but their failure to beat Wimbledon in the penultimate game of the league season handed the championship to United. The Liverpool Echo wrote, \"[Only] Michael Owen could emerge with any credit from a performance that mocked Anfield's rich traditions.\"[23] Owen, who had come on as a substitute in the second half, \"[breathed] new life into the Reds' championship corpse,\" and \"began [Liverpool's] best spell of the night\",[23] but was ultimately not able to salvage a win.[23] The Liverpool Echo stated, \"It was a debut marked in the grand manner.\"[23]\n\nOwen replaced the injured Robbie Fowler as Liverpool's first choice striker in 1997\u201398. He won the Premier League Golden Boot and was awarded the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Owen also finished in third place in the PFA Player of the Year voting behind Dennis Bergkamp and Tony Adams.[24] Owen recorded many personal feats during the season and helped Liverpool challenge for the league championship, but ultimately a run of bad form in February saw the club bowing out of the title race.[25] The Liverpool Echo wrote that, \"[Owen] has become Liverpool's most precious performer and, quite simply, their saviour.\"[25] Owen signed a five-year contract with Liverpool worth \u00a32.5\u00a0million during the season.[17] His \u00a310,000-a-week deal made him the highest-paid teenager in the history of British football.[17] Owen was runner-up to Zinedine Zidane in the World Player of the Year award, also finishing in fourth position in the FIFA World Player of the Year and European Player of the Year international awards.\n\nOwen retained the Premier League Golden Boot in 1998\u201399 despite incurring a hamstring injury against Leeds United that prematurely brought his season to an end on 12 April. With his pace identified as his greatest strength, Liverpool's game had revolved around feeding him with through passes and long balls. Owen constantly moved from static positions to full speed in a matter of split seconds. ESPN wrote, \"It [would] eventually [prove] too much for [Owen's] hamstring to handle.[18] Liverpool failed to challenge for the league title that season despite Owen's brilliant form. The club had appointed a new manager in G\u00e9rard Houllier and were transitioning out of the Spice Boys era. Owen ended the 1998\u201399 season as runners-up to Nicolas Anelka in the PFA Young Player of the Year award.[26]\n\nOwen returned to action after almost five months of layoff during the 1999\u20132000 season.[17] He played intermittently throughout the season and ended up ceding the Golden Boot to Kevin Phillips.[27] He had completed only six full games by January and, during a frustrating spell punctuated by recurring breakdowns,[27] had managed to stay the 90 minutes only three times since mid-October. Owen injured his hamstring once again while playing against Middlesbrough in January. He remained out of action for well over a month and later received treatment from German doctor Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt.[28] The persistent hamstring problems ended up robbing Liverpool of Owen for a third of a season in which a lack of goals eventually cost them a place in the Champions League.[28]\n\nOwen helped Liverpool to a treble in 2000\u201301, as the team won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup to end a six-year trophy drought.[29] Owen was the recipient of the European Player of the Year award in recognition of his performances that season.[30] He became the first English winner of the European Footballer of the Year award since Kevin Keegan was given the honour in 1979. Owen scored both Liverpool goals late in the 2001 FA Cup Final to turn around what had appeared to be a certain defeat for Liverpool at the hands of Arsenal.[31][32]\n\nLiverpool and Owen challenged for the league championship during the 2001\u201302 season.[33][34] The team eventually finished runners-up to Arsenal, with Owen playing a key part in the campaign.[33] On 29 December 2001, Owen scored his 100th goal for Liverpool during the season against West Ham United.[35] He also led them to success in the Charity Shield and the UEFA Super Cup during the start of the season in 2001. Liverpool thus became the first English team to win five trophies in one calendar year.[17] Owen signed a four-year contract worth \u00a370,000-a-week with Liverpool during the season, making him one of the highest earners in the English Premiership.[36]\n\nReal Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez started as early as in March 2002 to pursue Owen.[17] P\u00e9rez declared his intentions to make Owen the next Gal\u00e1ctico, stating that \"the best players must play for Real Madrid\".[17] Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier laughed off any apparent interest, saying, \"They might be able to afford Ronaldo but they cannot afford Michael Owen. For that kind of money they could only buy his left foot but he is not going anywhere. Michael is Liverpool through and through and he is staying with me.\"[17]\n\nOwen continued with strong performances in the 2002\u201303 season which saw Liverpool top the league table and remain unbeaten for several months.[37][38] However, a run of disastrous results starting from November and culminating in January saw the team bow out of the title race. Chelsea pipped Liverpool to the fourth and final Champions League spot on the final day of the season.[39][40] Owen was also controversially overlooked for the PFA Player of the Year award during the season.[38] He had continued establishing personal records with Liverpool and had scored his 100th Premier League goal on 26 April against West Bromwich Albion.[41] Success in the League Cup also meant that Liverpool had ended up with a trophy for a third consecutive season. Owen had scored in the League Cup Final against Manchester United to clinch the trophy for Liverpool.[17]\n\nLiverpool's failure to qualify for the Champions League led to speculation about Owen's long-term future.[42] Transfer speculation had continued linking him to Real Madrid and Barcelona.[43][44] Owen was quoted as saying, \"I really have to be playing in the Champions League and that is something [Liverpool] have to remedy.\"[45] Owen would later refute the quote, stating, \"Some of the words I never even said and the rest were taken completely out of context.\"[46]\n\nHoullier moved to re-shape the Liverpool squad in 2003 to reassure Owen.[42] He stated, \"We want to win the title. This is our vision at Liverpool \u2013 and we want to win it with Michael in our team.\" Michael is a genuine world-class player. He has had a great season and I think he will be even better next season.\"[42] Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce was quoted as saying, \"Stop Michael Owen scoring and you are 50 per cent towards getting a result at Anfield,\" while Owen had admitted to being frustrated at the lack of support play from his teammates.[47][48]\n\nAfter a shaky start to the 2003\u201304 season,[49] Liverpool emerged as title contenders once more, with Owen leading the charge.[49] Owen, however, would suffer an ankle injury while playing against Arsenal on 3 October and consequently went through \"three months of injury nightmare\".[50] Owen only played intermittently over the following months, suffering from niggling ankle and hamstring injuries, while Liverpool's season fell apart.[50] After a goal drought lasting nine games and three months, Owen returned to fitness and scoring form with a goal against Manchester City on 11 February.[51] Owen helped reignite Liverpool's hunt for fourth spot,[52] scoring his 150th goal for Liverpool in the subsequent match against Portsmouth on 15 February,[53] and although suffering from further injuries,[54] ultimately led Liverpool to the fourth and final Champions League spot.[55][56]\n\nFollowing G\u00e9rard Houllier's sacking as Liverpool manager, speculation about Owen's departure from the club began. During the first few Champions League games at the start of the 2004\u201305 season, Owen sat on the bench to avoid being cup-tied for the Champions League, something that would have meant he would be unable to play in European competitions for any other club that season. Since 1998, Owen had been Liverpool's top scorer every season until he left the club.[57] Real Madrid signed him for a fee of \u00a38\u00a0million on 13 August 2004, with midfielder Antonio N\u00fa\u00f1ez moving in the other direction as a make-weight.[58]\n\nFollowing their successful bid, Owen was presented with the number 11 shirt by Real Madrid. Owen joined the club during its Gal\u00e1cticos era, and played alongside Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ra\u00fal, Lu\u00eds Figo, Zinedine Zidane and his England teammate David Beckham.\n\nOwen had a slow start to his Madrid career. He was often confined to the bench and drew criticism from fans and the Spanish press for his lack of form. A successful return to action with the England squad in October 2004 seemed to revive his morale, however, and in the first following match, he scored his first goal for the club, the winner in a 1\u20130 Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv.[59] A few days later, he scored his first La Liga goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Valencia.[60] The scoring spree continued, as he found the back of the net in three of the next four matches to make it five goals in seven matches.\n\nOn 10 April 2005, Owen scored Real Madrid's fourth goal in a 4\u20132 El Cl\u00e1sico win over Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium.[61]\n\nOwen ended the 2004\u201305 season with 13 goals in La Liga, with the season's highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played. Following Madrid's signing of two high-profile Brazilian forwards, Robinho and J\u00falio Baptista, in the summer of 2005, the speculation arose that Owen would return to the Premier League. During his time at Real Madrid, Owen scored 16 goals from 45 games, 26 of which were starts.[62]\n\nOn 24 August 2005, Newcastle United announced that they had agreed to a club record fee[63] of \u00a316.8\u00a0million to obtain Owen, although they still had to negotiate with the player's advisers. Liverpool and local rivals Everton entered the fray, but were unwilling to match Madrid's asking price. As the 2006 World Cup was less than a year away, Owen wanted to get more playing time to secure his position as the first-choice striker in the England squad and joined Newcastle amid rumours that he had inserted an escape clause valued at \u00a312\u00a0million.[64] On 31 August 2005, Owen signed a four-year contract to play for Newcastle, despite initial press speculation that he would rather have returned to Liverpool.[65] Some 20,000 fans were present at Newcastle's home ground of St James' Park for Owen's official unveiling as a Newcastle player.[66][67] Several days after signing, he suffered a thigh-injury in pre-season, which ruled him out for the start of the 2005\u201306 season. He scored his first goal for the club on his second appearance, the second goal in a 3\u20130 away win at Blackburn Rovers on 18 September, Newcastle's first win of the season. Owen scored his first hat-trick for Newcastle in the 4\u20132 away win over West Ham United on 17 December.[68] It was also a \"perfect hat trick\", with one goal scored with each of his left foot, right foot and head.\n\nOn 31 December 2005, Owen broke a metatarsal bone in his foot in a match against Tottenham Hotspur. He underwent surgery to place a pin in the bone, to help speed the healing process. He was expected to be out of action until late March,[69] but the healing process did not go as hoped and on 24 March he underwent a second, minor operation. Owen then stated that he should be fit for the final few weeks of the season with Newcastle.[70] His return to action finally came against Birmingham City on 29 April when he came off the substitutes' bench in the 62nd minute. After the match, Owen stated that he was \"not 100% happy\" with his foot.[71] He underwent a further X-ray and made himself unavailable for Newcastle's final game of the season.\n\nA damaged anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee, sustained in the first minute of the group match against Sweden at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, kept Owen out of regular football for nearly a year, until April 2007. The seriousness of Owen's injury at the World Cup inflamed the so-called \"club-versus-country\" row in England, centring on the liability of the world governing body FIFA and The Football Association (FA) for the cost of injuries to players incurred while on international duty.[72] Newcastle were aggrieved at the length of time Owen would now be out of action in forthcoming Premier League and Cup competitions as a result of the World Cup injury, particularly as he had been out for the half-season prior to the World Cup. Under the existing insurance arrangements between club and country, FIFA and the FA had been paying \u00a350,000 of Owen's \u00a3110,000 weekly wages since he suffered the injury, totalling approximately \u00a32\u00a0million for the time he was out of action.[73] By September 2006, Newcastle were threatening to sue the FA for further compensation, for a reported figure of \u00a320\u00a0million.[74] The Owen case was a high-profile follow-up to an already ongoing legal claim for compensation from FIFA over an injury incurred by Abdelmajid Oulmers on international duty.[72]\n\nNewcastle's compensation claim included the \u00a310\u00a0million cost of buying Owen's replacement, Obafemi Martins, \u00a36.2\u00a0million towards Owen's salary costs while injured, the possibility of long-term damage to Owen's fitness and ability, the loss of league position and cup competition progress, depreciation of Owen's four-year contract, and the cost of medical treatment for Owen.[73][75] In February 2007, FIFA made Newcastle a \"final offer\" of \u00a31\u00a0million.[75] By April 2007, Newcastle were threatening to take out an injunction to stop the FA from picking Owen for England games.[76] The club finally reached a compromise settlement figure with FIFA and the FA; FIFA indicated that the settlement was between \u00a36\u00a0million and \u00a37\u00a0million. The club, stating that Owen's wages had \"now been paid in full\", stated the overall compensation achieved totalled \u00a310\u00a0million.[73] Resulting from the Owen compensation claim, the FA doubled their future insurance coverage of England players to \u00a3100,000, and FIFA introduced a compensation fund for injuries sustained at World Cups.[72]\n\nOwen began light training on 12 February 2007, when pictures on the club's official website highlighted Owen running and carrying out minor exercises.[77] He made his comeback from injury on 10 April 2007 in a 4\u20131 behind-closed-doors friendly against Gretna, scoring after ten minutes and then setting up fellow striker Shola Ameobi before coming off an hour later.[78] Owen then started his first game for Newcastle in over a year, a 1\u20130 loss against Reading on 30 April 2007. He played the full 90 minutes, having a goal disallowed for offside.[79]\nOwen was stretchered off an hour into Newcastle's game with Watford on 13 May 2007, suffering concussion after colliding with teammate Matty Pattison.[80]\n\nOn 9 May 2007, Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd reacted angrily to reports that Owen could move on to another club at the end of the 2006\u201307 season due to a release clause in his contract. A report in The Times newspaper suggested Owen could be available for less than \u00a310\u00a0million and could be a target for the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Despite these reports, Shepherd warned Owen \"to show some loyalty\" and warned him that \"none of the big four clubs want him\".[81] In a video posted on YouTube, however, a group of Liverpool fans asked Shepherd if they could re-sign Owen, he responded by saying that he would \"carry Owen back to Liverpool\" himself.[82] Shepherd also stated his dislike of Owen's agent but praised Owen as a \"good lad\".[83] This led many to believe that Owen would exercise his right to leave if the \u00a39\u00a0million valuation was matched.[82] On 10 June 2007, Owen's new manager at Newcastle, Sam Allardyce, confirmed the existence of the release clause in Owen's contract and said he feared that the club would be powerless to prevent Owen from leaving.[84] On 12 July 2007, however, Owen committed his immediate future to Newcastle, stating, \"I believe that these can be good times to be at Newcastle, which is why I am more than happy to be here.\"[85]\n\nOn 17 July 2007, he scored for Newcastle in a pre-season friendly against Hartlepool United.[86] Several days later, Owen picked up a thigh injury in training.[87] Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce said that Owen was likely to miss the start of the forthcoming Premier League season due to the injury which \"doesn't look as encouraging as we first thought\".[88] Owen made his comeback from injury in a club friendly on 13 August 2007 and declared himself available for Newcastle's next match, against Aston Villa, as well as England's forthcoming international matches.[89] On 29 August 2007, Owen scored his first competitive goal for Newcastle since December 2005 when he scored in the League Cup against Barnsley.[90] Three days later, he scored in the league with a late winner against Wigan Athletic.[91]\n\nIn late September 2007, after an encouraging start to the season playing for both Newcastle and England, it was reported that he would urgently require an operation for a double hernia and would likely be out of action for at least a month.[92] In his first match back from the hernia operation, he scored a late goal coming off the substitutes bench to clinch victory for Newcastle over Everton.[93]\n\nIn November 2007, Owen suffered a thigh strain while on international duty, ruling him out for six weeks. This reignited the \"club or country\" row, with then Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce voicing his disappointment that Owen was risked in a low-key friendly game against Austria.[94]\n\nAfter over three months without a goal, Owen scored the first goal of the second Kevin Keegan era in a 4\u20131 FA Cup third round replay win over Stoke City on 16 January 2008, although Keegan was only a spectator in the stands for this game. Owen was awarded the captaincy by Keegan on 19 January 2008. He scored his first league goal of 2008 on 3 February. Owen's goal in the 2\u20130 defeat of Fulham on 22 March 2008, which marked Newcastle's first win under Keegan's second spell as manager, also marked the first time in his Newcastle career that Owen had scored more goals for Newcastle than against them.[95] By 5 April 2008, after his and the team's early season poor form, Owen had scored six goals in the previous six matches, with Newcastle registering four wins and two draws, lifting Newcastle into mid-table after earlier relegation fears. In the final game of the season, Owen scored in a 3\u20131 loss at Everton, finishing with 11 goals in total, putting him in equal 13th position for Premier League goals for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nOwen missed all of the pre-season matches and training of the 2008\u201309 season due to a bout of mumps, which also kept him out of the international friendlies with the USA and Trinidad and Tobago in May 2008. He also suffered a calf strain during the summer months which kept him out of the opening game of the season against Manchester United at Old Trafford, a game which Newcastle drew 1\u20131. He made his return in the second game of the season against Bolton Wanderers on 23 August 2008, coming on in the 53rd minute for the injured Obafemi Martins. He scored the winning header in the 71st minute, with the game finishing 1\u20130. Three days later, he was named on the bench in a League Cup match away to Coventry City, he came on as a substitute and scored the winner in extra time in a 2\u20133 victory. In the 2008\u201309 season, he featured more consistently than in prior seasons, scoring four goals in twelve league appearances.\n\nUnder the transfer rules, with the 2008\u201309 season being the final year of his contract with Newcastle, Owen would have been allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with other clubs during January. On 22 December 2008, Owen rejected a new contract offer from Newcastle, but stated that he would not be seeking a move in the January transfer window and instead intended to postpone talks over his contract situation until the end of the season.[96][97] With speculation over his future continuing in the second half of the season, Owen received \"substantial damages\" in June in the High Court in London and a public apology following a story on 15 May in the Daily Express alleging that due to a lack of interest from Premier League clubs, Owen's career was effectively finished and he intended to retire.[98][99]\n\nAfter a disastrous season in general for the club, which culminated in Owen's former Newcastle and England teammate Alan Shearer being brought in as a temporary manager for the final eight games of the season, on the final day of the season on 24 May 2009, Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League for the first time in 15 years. On 14 June, it was reported that Owen's management company Wasserman Media Group had sent out a 34-page brochure advertising Owen to several potential clubs.[100] On 22 June, Owen confirmed he would not be re-signing for Newcastle, in preference for a move to a Premier League club, or another top-flight foreign club.[97] It was reported that Owen would not begin negotiations with any other club until after 30 June when, on expiry of his contract, he would become eligible for a free transfer.[97]\n\nIn September 2019, Owen stated that he regretted his move to Newcastle and that he had hoped for a return to Liverpool.[101]\n\nOn 3 July 2009, it was announced that Owen had signed a two-year deal with Manchester United, arch rivals of Liverpool.[102] A surprise move, Owen said that the approach from manager Alex Ferguson was \"out of the blue\". He signed a pay-as-you-play deal[102] and was handed the number 7 shirt vacated by the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. The shirt had previously been worn by many of United's other illustrious players over the years, including Johnny Berry, George Best, Steve Coppell, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[103]\n\nOwen scored his first goal for United on his debut, scoring an 84th-minute winner after coming on as a substitute in a pre-season friendly against a Malaysian XI;[104] he followed this up by scoring three more goals in United's pre-season games.[105][106] Owen made his league debut for United when he came on as a substitute against Birmingham City on 16 August in a 1\u20130 win,[107] and scored his first competitive goal in a Manchester United shirt against Wigan Athletic on 22 August in a 5\u20130 away win.[108] On 20 September, Owen scored his first goal at Old Trafford, in the sixth minute of stoppage time against local rivals Manchester City to give United a 4\u20133 derby win. This meant that Owen had now scored in his fourth derby, after scoring in the Merseyside derby, El Cl\u00e1sico and the Tyne\u2013Wear derby in previous years.[109] Owen struggled to recall the moments immediately after the goal, and said that it ranked as one of his most important.[110]\n\nOn 27 October, Owen scored a goal in the 2\u20130 away win against Barnsley to qualify United past the fourth round of the League Cup. On 3 November, Owen scored his first Champions League goal for Manchester United, as he grabbed United's first in the 3\u20133 draw against CSKA Moscow.[111] Owen's seemingly slim chances of earning a place in Fabio Capello's England squad for the 2010 World Cup finals in 2010 received a boost when on 8 December 2009, Owen scored his first hat-trick for Manchester United in a 3\u20131 away win against VfL Wolfsburg in the Champions League, his first hat-trick since 2005.[112] On 28 February 2010, Owen scored United's first goal in their 2\u20131 victory over Aston Villa in the 2010 League Cup final, but had to be substituted after pulling up on 42 minutes. Originally thought to be a minor injury, on 5 March it was announced Owen required surgery on his hamstring, ruling him out for the rest of the season.[113]\n\nOwen scored his first goal for United back from injury in a 7\u20131 pre-season victory against a League of Ireland XI on 4 August 2010 at the newly built Aviva Stadium.[114] On 22 September 2010, Owen scored twice during a 5\u20132 away win over Scunthorpe United in the third round of the League Cup, his first goals of the season.[115] Four days later, Owen scored his first league goal of the season, United's second equaliser with his first touch in a 2\u20132 away draw against Bolton Wanderers.[116] Owen's first goal of 2011 came in United's 2\u20131 FA Cup victory over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium on 29 January.[117] On 25 February, United manager Alex Ferguson said that Owen was a key part of his squad for the rest of the season. However, he suffered a groin injury and missed his team's next four games. His return match was on 19 March when he returned to the bench for United's game against Bolton.\n\nBy the time of United's penultimate game of the season, he had reached the number of league appearances required for a title winner's medal \u2013 his first in 15 seasons as a professional.[118] The game, on 14 May 2011, only required United to draw with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park to win the title, and a 1\u20131 draw secured it for them. Owen was an unused substitute in the game.[119] Owen scored United's final goal in their last league game of the season, at home to Blackpool, in which the Red Devils won 4\u20132.[120]\n\nOwen was an unused substitute in Man United's Champions League final defeat to Barcelona, marking the end of his season. He signed a one-year extension to his contract on 1 June 2011.[121]\n\nOwen started his first game of the season in the third round of the League Cup against Leeds United. He scored two goals in the first half, helping United to progress to the fourth round with a 3\u20130 win. His first goal came after he advanced to the box and scuffed a shot into the corner of the net. The second goal came on the half-hour mark, when he met Mame Biram Diouf's cross with instant control, before firing a right foot shot into the top.[122] Owen started his second game of the season in the fourth round of the League Cup, against League Two club Aldershot Town. He scored the second goal of the 3\u20130 win. Dimitar Berbatov completed a run down the right flank before pulling the ball back into the box, with Owen scoring past Ross Worner.[123]\n\nOwen started in United's home Champions League group stage match against O\u021belul Gala\u021bi on 2 November, however he was substituted early in the first half when he pulled up with a thigh injury; this was his last appearance for the team. In February 2012, Owen started light training with the Manchester United squad. From April 2012, Owen started full training but was not yet ready for first team games. On 13 May 2012, Owen was named as a substitute against Sunderland in United's final fixture, but he was not brought on.\n\nOn 17 May 2012, Owen announced on Twitter that Manchester United would not be offering him a new deal, ending his three-year association with the club.\n\nOn 4 September 2012, Owen joined Stoke City on a one-year contract.[124] He was handed the number 10 shirt from the departed Ricardo Fuller and made his debut in a 1\u20131 draw against Manchester City on 15 September.[125] The start to his time at Stoke was hampered by a hamstring injury.[126] Owen scored his first and only goal for Stoke on 19 January 2013 in a 3\u20131 defeat at Swansea City, his first goal since 25 October 2011. In doing so, he became only the seventh player to reach 150 Premier League goals.[127]\n\nOn 19 March 2013, Owen announced that he would retire from playing at the end of the 2012\u201313 season.[128] He was restricted to just eight Premier League appearances for Stoke, all coming from the substitutes bench, including in his final appearance on 19 May 2013 against Southampton, where he received a standing ovation from both sets of supporters.[129][130]\n\n\"He is in the top four of our greatest finishers, along with Jimmy Greaves, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer. Some might say he is at the top of that list. He was a baby-faced assassin. His finishing was amazing for a young man.\"\n\nGlenn Hoddle[131]\n\nOwen was capped 89 times for England and scored 40 goals. He is sixth in the list of all-time top scorers for the England team, behind Harry Kane (54), Wayne Rooney (53), Bobby Charlton (49), Gary Lineker (48) and Jimmy Greaves (44). He is also England's second-highest goalscorer in competitive international matches, behind Rooney.[132] His 89 caps also place him as England's eleventh most capped player.\n\nOwen played for England at the 1998, 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups and the 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships. He scored goals in all but one of these tournaments, making him the only player ever to have scored in four major tournaments for England.[133]\n\nOwen had a highly successful record at Youth level, playing for the England under-20 team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship and scoring three goals in four games. He played once for the England under-21 team, scoring in a win over Greece at Carrow Road.\n\nHe made his debut for the England senior team in a 2\u20130 friendly loss to Chile on 11 February 1998. This made Owen the youngest player to represent England in the 20th century at 18 years and 59 days of age.[134]\n\nOwen's youthful enthusiasm, pace and talent made him a popular player across the country,[135] and many fans were keen for him to be selected for the 1998 World Cup in France. In a pre-World Cup friendly against Morocco, Owen scored his first goal for England.[136] The goal also made him the youngest ever player to have scored for England,[137] until his record was surpassed by Wayne Rooney in 2003.\n\n\"For me [Michael Owen was] the only good thing to come out of the \u201998 World Cup. Speed, cunning, balls. \" \u2014 Diego Maradona on Owen\u2019s performance in the 1998 World Cup.[138]\n\nOwen was selected for the World Cup squad by manager Glenn Hoddle, becoming England's youngest ever player at a World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the opening match against Tunisia. In the following match, a 2\u20131 defeat to Romania, Owen again appeared as a substitute. His equalising goal made him England's youngest ever goalscorer in the tournament at the age of 18 years and 190 days. In stoppage time, he hit the post with a long range shot, almost salvaging a point from the game.[139] Because of his impact against Romania, Hoddle selected Owen in the starting line-up for England's decisive group match against Colombia. England won the match and Owen retained his place for the second round match against Argentina.\n\nAfter Argentina had taken a sixth-minute lead, Owen was fouled in the penalty area by Roberto Ayala and Alan Shearer equalised with the penalty kick. In the 16th minute, Owen gave England a 2\u20131 lead with a sensational individual goal. After beating defenders Ayala and Jos\u00e9 Chamot, he struck the ball past goalkeeper Carlos Roa from just outside the penalty box. In 2013, the goal was voted as the third-greatest in England's history.[140] England eventually drew the match and went out of the tournament on penalties, with Owen successfully converting his kick.[141] At the end of the year, he won a public vote to be elected winner of the prestigious BBC Sports Personality of the Year title.[142]\n\nOwen started the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying phase as a regular in the England starting line-up. However, injury problems meant he missed much of the campaign as England struggled, with Hoddle being replaced by Kevin Keegan. On 4 September 1999, he scored his first goal at Wembley Stadium in a 6\u20130 win over Luxembourg.[143]\n\nAt the finals, Owen scored once in three matches, as England were knocked out at the group stage.\n\nAfter Alan Shearer's retirement, Owen took over as England's senior striker[144] under new manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. He scored six times during 2002 World Cup qualifying, including a hat-trick against Germany at Munich's Olympiastadion, as England won the qualifying group. His performances saw him named European Footballer of the Year for 2001.[145]\n\n\"You know that if he is on the pitch, there is always the chance to win until the last second of the game. There are so many good memories of Michael and my relationship with him as coach, but it must be scoring three goals against Germany away. I never thought about that, but I wonder now how many players have scored three goals in Germany away? That can't be many.\"\n\nSven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson[131]\n\nIn April 2002, he was named as England's captain for a friendly match against Paraguay in place of the injured regular captain David Beckham. Owen was the youngest England captain since Bobby Moore in 1963,[146] and in the following few seasons regularly deputised for Beckham as Eriksson's vice-captain.\n\nAt the 2002 World Cup finals, Owen failed to score during the group stage. However, he was fouled for England's match winning penalty kick in the 1\u20130 win over Argentina. Owen scored in England's second round match against Denmark and then gave England an early lead in the 2\u20131 quarter-final defeat against Brazil.\n\nOwen scored five times in qualification for Euro 2004.\n\nAt the tournament proper, Owen again failed to score during the group stage. He then scored in the third minute of the quarter-final with Portugal, becoming the first England player to score in four consecutive major tournaments.[147] England went on to lose on penalties after a 2\u20132 draw.\n\nIn qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Owen scored five goals.\n\nIn May 2005, he scored his second international hat-trick in a friendly match against Colombia at Giants Stadium.[148] In another pre-World Cup friendly, Owen scored two late goals to give England a 3\u20132 win over rivals Argentina in November 2005.[149]\n\nOwen made his debut for the England B-team in a friendly against Belarus on 25 May 2006, as part of his return to match fitness ahead of the 2006 World Cup. He captained England B in this game, playing for 61\u00a0minutes before being substituted.[150]\n\nOwen started England's first two games of the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago, but did not manage to score. After playing only 51 seconds of his third appearance of the tournament, and 80th cap, in the final group game against Sweden, Owen badly twisted his right knee and was forced to leave the match on a stretcher.[151] A scan of the injury on 21 June confirmed that Owen had torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee, and was sent home, no longer able to play in the tournament.[152] In March 2009, Owen admitted that all injuries he was sustaining were relating back to his injury in the 2006 World Cup tournament, and that he should not have returned prematurely from injury to participate in the competition.[153]\n\nOwen underwent successful reconstruction surgery, carried out by Richard Steadman, on 6 September 2006.[154] The injury sidelined him until April 2007, meaning he missed England's first six matches in qualifying for Euro 2008. He returned for the England B game against Albania,[155] and was named in the full squad for the first England match at the new Wembley Stadium against Brazil and the Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia,[156] with Owen stating \"I feel sharp and, if given the chance, I feel confident when in front of goal.\"[157] He played in both matches and scored against Estonia, breaking Gary Lineker's record for most goals in competitive internationals for England.[158]\n\nOn 12 September 2007, Owen scored twice for England in a 3\u20130 win over Russia, becoming the first player to score international goals at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums.[159] These were to be Owen's final goals for England.[160]\n\nAfter England failed to qualify for Euro 2008, manager Steve McClaren was replaced by Fabio Capello. Owen made only one appearance under Capello, as a substitute in a friendly against France in March 2008.[161]\n\nIn his prime, Owen was highly regarded for his great pace,[162] opportunism[163] and agility,[164] as well as his technical ability and his eye for goal,[163][164] which enabled him to be considered one of the greatest English and Premier League strikers of his generation.[165] A prolific goalscorer, Owen was a powerful and accurate finisher,[164][166] who was also effective with his head, despite his lack of height.[164][166][167][168] He was also capable of linking up with and creating chances for teammates due to his short passing ability and vision.[164][166] Despite, or even due to, his precocious talent in his youth,[164] Owen faced many injuries throughout his career, which in later years affected his pace, fitness, mobility and the overall consistency of his performances.[169]\n\nOwen met Louise Bonsall at primary school in 1984.[170] The couple bought Lower Soughton Manor in Flintshire, North Wales, where they keep his cars and her horses. They were engaged on 14 February 2004, and married on 24 June 2005,[171] at the Carden Park Hotel in Chester, Cheshire. The couple had initially planned to get married at their home, but changed plans when they were informed that if a licence was granted for a marriage ceremony the venue must be made available for other weddings for three years,[170] so opted to marry in a register office in informal clothing and have a lavish reception the next day in the grounds of their home.\n\nTheir daughter, Gemma Rose, was born on 1 May 2003.[172] On 6 February 2006, they had a son named James Michael. Their third child, a daughter, Emily May, was born on 29 October 2007.[173] Their fourth child Jessica was born on 26 February 2010.[174]\n\nAfter Owen returned to the UK to play for Newcastle, he travelled to a nearby BAE Systems facility on a daily basis in order to fly, by helicopter, to train with his club. However, there is now a helipad installed within the grounds of the house to accommodate Owen's Eurocopter Dauphin, with which he both travels and is training to become a pilot.[175] Owen was eventually banned from training to be a pilot by Newcastle United due to excessive insurance premiums.[176]\n\nOwen bought multiple houses on one street for his extended family in Ewloe, which is in an area close to where he used to live.[177][178]\n\nIn 2004, Owen's sister Karen was assaulted by two youths, who attempted to kidnap her. When she revealed that she was pregnant, they fled.[179]\n\nOwen owns several cars and a helicopter and enjoys horse racing and gambling. He owns many race horses, trained by Tom Dascombe.[180] He bred the horse Brown Panther which won a major race at Royal Ascot in 2011,[181] and the 2015 Dubai Gold Cup.[182] Owen was a brand ambassador for British bookmaker Colossus Bets.[183]\n\nOn 24 November 2017, Owen rode on Calder Prince at Ascot and finished second, beaten by Tom Chatfield-Roberts on Golden Wedding. He was one of 10 amateur riders to take part in the seven-furlong 'Prince's Countryside Fund Charity' contest, which was attended by HRH Prince Charles and HRH Duchess of Cornwall.[184]\n\nOwen starred in a series of adverts that charted his life and rise to fame.[185] In 2001, he was the advertising face of breakfast cereal \"Nestl\u00e9 Sporties\". He also appeared in several adverts for the washing powder Persil, in a contract worth \u00a31\u00a0million.[185] Owen was selected as one of the two cover athletes for Pro Evolution Soccer 2008.[186] He has been an ambassador of the Swiss watchmaker Tissot since 1998 and has a contract with car manufacturer Jaguar.[187][188]\n\nOwen also starred as himself in the children's television drama show Hero to Zero. In the programme, Owen would emerge from a full size poster of himself in Charlie Brice's room to offer advice in times of crisis.[189]\n\nOwen had indicated that he would like to become involved with Chester in some capacity when he retires, as it was his local team growing up and his father played for the old Chester side which went out of business in March 2010 and was reformed at a lower level.[190]\n\nIn January 2018, Owen participated in And They're Off! in aid of Sport Relief, winning the episode.[191]\n\nIn January 2022, Owen appeared on the third series of The Masked Singer as \"Doughnuts\". He was seventh to be unmasked.[192]\n\nIn May 2022, cryptocasino Punt announced Owen as their most recent global brand ambassador.[193] Following this, in June 2022 Owen was found to have breached UK laws regarding gambling advertising, as he had used his Twitter account to promote an unlicenced cryptocurrency casino to the British public. He was instructed by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to delete the promotions for the non-fungible token scheme, which breached rules about advertising cryptocurrency gambling products.[194]\n\nIn June 2022, his oldest daughter Gemma, now 19, took part in series 8 of ITV reality show Love Island where she finished in second place.[195][196]\n\nLiverpool[201]\n\nNewcastle United\n\nManchester United[201]\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen"}, {"id": 11, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/83/1659729/original/neil-lennon-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Neil Lennon", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/neil-lennon/1659729", "desc": "Neil Francis Lennon (born 25 June 1971) is a Northern Irish football coach and former player who is the manager of Scottish Premiership club Celtic.\nDuring his playing career he represented English clubs Manchester City, Crewe Alexandra and Leicester City.

Lennon moved to Celtic in 2000, where he made over 200 appearances and was appointed captain in 2005. Before retiring as a player, he returned to England and played for Nottingham Forest and Wycombe Wanderers. Lennon also earned 40 caps for the Northern Ireland national team over nine years, scoring two goals.\n\nLennon was appointed manager of former club Celtic in March 2010, initially in a caretaker capacity, following the departure of Tony Mowbray.[3][4][5] Lennon enjoyed significant success as Celtic manager, winning three Scottish league championships, two Scottish Cups, qualifying for the group stage of the Champions League twice and the knockout stages once, before leaving the club in May 2014. After an unsuccessful spell back in England with Bolton Wanderers, marred by the club's financial problems, Lennon returned to Scottish football in 2016 with Hibernian. He led them to promotion back to the Scottish Premiership in his first season as head coach, and European qualification in his second season, before leaving Hibernian in January 2019.\n\nLennon returned to Celtic in February 2019, initially on an interim basis for the rest of the 2018\u201319 season, and guided them to the league and Scottish Cup titles. His contract was renewed and he led Celtic to the Scottish league title again in 2019\u201320. He also led the team to a fourth consecutive domestic treble by also winning the League Cup and the Scottish Cup that season. Lennon left Celtic in February 2021, as the club had fallen far behind Rangers in the 2020\u201321 Scottish Premiership.\n\nLennon returned to football a year later, becoming the new manager of Cypriot club Omonia in March 2022.[6] Less than three months after arriving on the island, he led the club to win the Cypriot Cup, their first since 2012. He was sacked in October 2022 due to disappointing results in the domestic league.\n\nLennon was born in Lurgan, County Armagh[7] and attended St Michael's Grammar School in the town.[8] As a youngster he played gaelic football for the school and was also selected for the Armagh minor team.[9] He grew up supporting Celtic[10] and played football for the local Lurgan Celtic youth team.[11]\n\nLennon joined Glenavon, after reaching the final of the Milk Cup with Glenavon Select[11] and scored on his Irish League debut.[11] He then joined Manchester City as a trainee in 1987. He made one first team appearance during his time in Manchester, a league match on 30 April 1988 away against Birmingham City,[12] before signing for Crewe Alexandra on a free transfer in August 1990.[13] Lennon made his debut for Crewe on 18 September 1990 against Reading.[14] Despite missing the whole of season 1991\u201392 due to a back injury,[11] he became an established member of the side and impressed with his intelligent play and consistent performances.[14][15] Lennon's form saw him make his debut for Northern Ireland in 1994, and thus became the first Crewe Alexandra player in 60 years to win a full international cap.[16][17] In 5+1\u20442 years at Crewe, Lennon made 187 appearances for the club and scored 18 goals.[14]\n\nIn February 1996, Lennon signed for Leicester City for a fee of \u00a3750,000 (\u00a31,500,000 today).[18] In May 1996, Lennon played in the Leicester City side that defeated Crystal Palace 2\u20131 at Wembley in the Play-off Final to win promotion to the Premier League.[19] On 16 April 1997, Lennon picked up his first major winner's medal when Leicester won 1\u20130 against Middlesbrough in a replayed League Cup Final.[20] He played in a further two League Cup Finals during his time at Filbert Street, losing 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in March 1999[21] but winning 2\u20131 against Tranmere Rovers in February 2000.[22]\n\nAn on-field incident during a league match in 1998 against Newcastle United between Lennon and Alan Shearer resulted in the England international being charged with misconduct by the FA,[23] Television footage showed Shearer appearing to intentionally kick Lennon in the head following a challenge.[24] The referee of the game took no action against Shearer. Shearer apologised afterwards, but denied that the contact with Lennon was deliberate, and Lennon later gave evidence in Shearer's defence at the FA hearing which subsequently cleared the Newcastle and England striker of all charges.[25]\n\nAfter Martin O'Neill became the new manager of Celtic in June 2000, he made several attempts to sign Lennon. Finally after months of protracted negotiations with Leicester, on 6 December 2000 Lennon joined the club he supported as a boy for a fee of \u00a35.75 million (\u00a310,300,000 today).[26][27] That season saw Lennon pick-up three winner's medals as Celtic swept to a domestic treble, winning the Scottish Premier League, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup. The next four seasons at Celtic saw Lennon win a further two league championships and two Scottish Cups. He was also an integral part of the Celtic side that reached the UEFA Cup Final in 2003, losing 3-2 to Porto after extra time.[28]\n\nWhen Gordon Strachan took over from Martin O'Neill as Celtic manager in the summer of 2005, he made Lennon Celtic captain. In January 2006 when his former club Leicester City sacked Craig Levein, Lennon was linked with a return to the Midlands side in a player-manager role. He went on record saying he was flattered but wanted to captain Celtic to the Scottish Premier League title.[29]\n\nAlthough he was also linked with a move to Crystal Palace in a player-manager role in the summer of 2006,[30] on 23 June 2006, Celtic announced he had signed a new one-year contract. Sunderland manager Roy Keane made an attempt to sign Lennon prior to the closure of the August 2006 transfer window, but his approach for the player was rejected by Celtic. On 25 April 2007, Lennon announced he would be leaving Celtic, and in his last game for the club on 26 May 2007, he captained the team to victory in the Scottish Cup Final against Dunfermline Athletic. Celtic's 1\u20130 win clinched the League and Cup Double.[31]\n\nLennon joined League One club Nottingham Forest on a one-year contract with an option for a second year on 12 June 2007.[32] He made his debut captaining the side in a 0\u20130 draw at home to AFC Bournemouth.[33] He missed a week's training with Forest in November 2007, because of family reasons in Scotland,[34] and lost his place in the team as a consequence.[35]\n\nLennon joined Wycombe Wanderers of League Two on a free transfer on 31 January 2008, managed by his former Celtic midfield partner Paul Lambert.[35] He left on 3 April to take up a coaching role with Celtic.[36]\n\nLennon made his international debut for Northern Ireland on 11 June 1994 when he come on as a substitute in a friendly against Mexico in Miami.[14] He had to wait nearly a year for his next cap when he played against Chile in another friendly.[14] Lennon made his first competitive appearance three months later on 3 September 1995 in a European Championship qualifier away against Portugal. After that, Lennon became a fixture in the international side although Northern Ireland were unsuccessful in their attempts to qualify for the finals of major tournaments.\n\nLennon decided to retire from international football in August 2002 upon receiving a death threat before a Northern Ireland match against Cyprus. The threats came after his alleged claim that he wanted to play for a team representing a United Ireland.[37] The threat was allegedly made by the Loyalist Volunteer Force, although the organisation later denied this.[38][39]\n\nLennon was capped 40 times by Northern Ireland,[7] scoring two goals. He also captained the team on several occasions.[citation needed]\n\nScores and results list Northern Ireland's goal tally first\n\nLennon was linked with the vacant manager's job at Hibernian after the resignation of John Collins,[43] but the job was given to Mixu Paatelainen. Lennon's first coaching appointment was as first team coach with Celtic in 2008.[44] After the appointment of Tony Mowbray as Celtic manager, Lennon took charge of the Celtic reserve team.[45]\n\nCeltic won the Jock Stein Friendship Cup match on penalties in his first match.[46] With no reserve league, the team played a series of friendlies in Ireland against the first teams of Cork City, Drogheda United, Shamrock Rovers, and Cliftonville, losing only once.[47] They played several times in England against Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Chelsea, Huddersfield Town, Newcastle United\nand Sunderland.[47]\n\nFollowing Mowbray's departure from Celtic on 25 March 2010, Lennon was appointed caretaker manager for the remainder of the 2009\u201310 season.[48] He appointed former teammate Johan Mj\u00e4llby as his assistant. Celtic won all of their remaining league games under Lennon, including wins over Kilmarnock,[49] Hibernian,[50] and Rangers,[51] but lost 2\u20130 to First Division side Ross County in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.[52] In the aftermath of that defeat, Lennon spoke frankly about the Celtic players and their performances over the course of the season. He said that they had lacked \"hunger and desire\" and that whether he was installed as manager or not, he would be recommending a significant clear-out of players to the board.[53][54]\n\nLennon was appointed manager of Celtic on a full-time basis on 9 June 2010.[3][55] He retained Mj\u00e4llby as his assistant, as well as former Celtic teammate Alan Thompson and former Leicester City teammate Garry Parker as first-team coaches[56]\n\n\nHe made considerable changes to the Celtic team for the 2010\u201311 season. He sold Aiden McGeady for a then Scottish record \u00a39.5 million along with captain Stephen McManus[57] and goalkeeper Artur Boruc.[58] 13 other players also left the club, this gave Lennon enough funds to re-build for the new season. Lennon then went on to sign several talented, young, cheap, relatively unknown players, from smaller leagues around the world;[59] striker Gary Hooper arrived from English side Scunthorpe,[60][61] Israeli international Beram Kayal was signed,[62][63] and Honduran left-back Emilio Izaguirre also signed on.[59][64] Lennon also signed several experienced players on free transfers. Charlie Mulgrew,[65][66] Joe Ledley,[67][68][69] and Daniel Majstorovi\u0107[70] all went into the first team. In addition to these Lennon also signed five other players, including Fraser Forster[71][72] on loan from Newcastle who became first choice 'keeper and helped set a new SPL record for most clean sheets.[73] \nOn 28 July, in his first competitive game as full-time manager, Celtic lost 3\u20130 away to Braga in the UEFA Champions League.[74] Celtic won their first eight league matches under Lennon, although controversy erupted in their 2\u20131 win away at Dundee United on 17 October 2010. Celtic were awarded a penalty kick in the second half, but the decision was then rescinded by referee Dougie McDonald. McDonald explained after the match that he over-ruled the penalty award on the advice of the assistant referee. Lennon reluctantly accepted McDonald's explanation, commenting \"I suppose you have to put it down to another honest mistake by the referee.\"[75] It was, however, later revealed that McDonald had lied in his explanation over the penalty award and the referee subsequently resigned several weeks later having received a warning from the Scottish Football Association after failing to properly explain his overturning of the penalty award.[76] Further referring controversy ensued the following week when Celtic lost their unbeaten run in the league, losing 3\u20131 at home against Rangers. The Ibrox club's third goal came as a result of penalty awarded when Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot fell to the ground under a challenge from Celtic's Daniel Majstorovi\u0107. Broadfoot appeared to have dived, and television footage showed that the referee had his back to the play when the challenge occurred, only turning in time to see Broadfoot fall to the ground.[77] Lennon stated afterwards that he felt the referee \"got a couple of decisions wrong\", and added regarding the penalty, \"I'm not sure that he saw it so I don't know why he's given it. He's got a lot of questions to answer\".[77] In November, Lennon led Celtic to a 9\u20130 win over Aberdeen, a record win in the Scottish Premier League and Aberdeen's heaviest ever defeat.[78] Celtic lost their next game 2\u20130 away against Hearts, with Celtic's Joe Ledley sent off for the first time in his career for a \"strong\" challenge on Ian Black. Celtic were later denied a penalty award in the second half, and shortly afterwards Lennon was sent to the stand by the referee. Lennon defended Ledley after the match, describing referee Craig Thomson's decision as \"ridiculous\".[79][80] Lennon was later given a six match touchline ban for excessive misconduct as a result of the incident in the Hearts' game, although it was later reduced to four matches after appeal.[81] He was given another four match touchline ban by the SFA following an altercation with Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist after a Scottish Cup match in March 2011.[82]\n\nLennon led Celtic to the final of the League Cup in March 2011, but they lost 2\u20131 to Rangers after extra time.[83] They remained in contention for the SPL title until the final day of the 2010\u201311 season, when they won 4\u20130 at home to Motherwell, but finished a point behind Rangers.[84] He won his first silverware as a manager when Celtic beat Motherwell 3\u20130 in the Scottish Cup Final a week later.[85]\n\nAfter rallying from a poor start to season 2011\u201312, Lennon won the SPL Manager of the Month award for November 2011.[86] The club went on to win the 2011\u201312 Scottish Premier League and Lennon was made SFWA Manager of the Year.[87] Lennon then guided Celtic through two qualification rounds to reach the group stage of the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League, where Celtic beat Barcelona one day after the club's 125th birthday.[88] Celtic qualified out of their group to the knock-out stages of the Champions League.[89] Celtic were comfortably beaten on aggregate by Juventus in the last 16 round, but both Celtic and Lennon were still praised for their overall Champions League campaign.[90][91] On 21 April 2013, Celtic retained the Premier League title. Lennon finished the season by leading Celtic to a League and Cup double with a 3\u20130 win over Hibernian in the Scottish Cup Final.[92]\n\nCeltic qualified for the group stages of the Champions League again the following season,[93] but had a dismal campaign; winning only once with a 2\u20131 home win over Ajax,[94] and slumping to a 6\u20131 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match.[95] They fared little better in the domestic cup competitions; losing 1-0 to Morton in their first game in the Scottish League Cup,[96] and losing 2-1 to Aberdeen in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup.[97] The League campaign was much more impressive through; undefeated until February and losing only twice in all over the course of the season in which they scored 102 goals on the way to their third successive League title.[98] On 22 May 2014, Lennon announced that he was leaving Celtic after four years as manager. \"I have parted company with Celtic,\" he said in a brief statement, adding \"The club are in a very strong position and I wish the fans and the club all the very best for the future.\"[99]\n\nLennon was announced as the new manager of Bolton Wanderers on 12 October 2014, signing a four-year contract.[100] He won his first game in charge 1\u20130 against Birmingham City at St Andrew's stadium, although he was sent to the stands in the 81st minute after an altercation with referee Mark Hayward caused by Lennon leaving his technical area before Craig Davies's penalty was saved.[101] Lennon's first three months in charge saw Bolton rise ten places from bottom of the league up to fourteenth; a spell that included an eight match unbeaten run and four consecutive clean sheets.[102][103] Bolton reached the fourth round of the FA Cup and took Liverpool to a replay before conceding a last minute goal to lose 2\u20131 and go out.[104] Things didn't go well for Lennon thereafter, with Bolton winning only one of their last 11 games of the season,[105] and Barry Bannan and Neil Danns being suspended by Lennon for off-field indiscipline.[106] Bolton did however succeed in avoiding relegation, finishing 18th in the league.[107]\n\nBolton struggled at the start of the following season, and by October 2015 were lying bottom of the table with only one win in their first eleven league games.[108] Lennon maintained confidence in his ability to improve Bolton's fortunes, stating \"I didn't realise quite how tough it was going to be but I have got faith in my own ability and I believe we'll turn things around.\"[108] By the end of November 2015, Bolton had gone on a run of twelve games without a win, and remained bottom of the Championship.[109] At this time, the club announced that their squad had not been paid this month \"due to a short-term funding issue\" in a statement which came hours before their 1\u20131 draw with Brentford. In that game, Bolton striker Gary Madine was seen on television mouthing an insult towards Lennon, although the manager played down the incident afterwards, stating \"I don't know what he said. He's a Geordie, I can't understand him! It was probably reciprocated!\"[110] Bolton continued to struggle and, with the club at the bottom of the table, Lennon left by \"mutual consent\" on 15 March 2016.[111]\n\nLennon was appointed head coach of Scottish Championship club Hibernian in June 2016.[112][113] He led the \"Hibees\" to the Scottish Championship title and promotion back to the Scottish Premiership (after a three-season absence) in his first season.[114] In September 2017, Lennon and Hibs agreed to extend his contract to the end of the 2019\u201320 season.[115] Hibs finished fourth in the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership and qualified for the Europa League.[116]\n\nOn 25 January 2019, Lennon was suspended by Hibernian following an exchange with other club employees.[117] On 30 January, it was announced that he and assistant coach Garry Parker had left the club by mutual consent. A club statement said that \"neither Neil nor Garry has been guilty of any misconduct or wrongdoing and no disciplinary process has been commenced. The suspension, put in place to allow an internal review, was lifted by the club as part of this agreement.\"[118]\n\nOn 26 February 2019, Lennon was appointed manager of Celtic for a second time, taking over until the end of the campaign following Brendan Rodgers' mid-season departure for Leicester City.[119] Having helped the club achieve an unprecedented third domestic treble (\"treble treble\"), Lennon was appointed permanent manager for a second time at the end of the season.[120] The 2019\u201320 season saw very similar success, even following the suspension of professional football as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The season was later curtailed and the title awarded to Celtic, who were thirteen points clear at the time of suspension, equalling the national record of nine consecutive championships set by Celtic in the 1970s and matched by Rangers in the 1990s. In addition to the league, they were once again victorious in the League and Scottish cups, giving the club their fourth consecutive domestic treble.\n\nFollowing a positive start to the 2020\u201321 campaign, Lennon came under significant criticism after the club underwent a poor run of results that began with a 2\u20130 Old Firm home loss to Rangers on 17 October; this was followed by failure to qualify for the Champions League group stage, elimination from the Europa League in the group stage and elimination from the League Cup in the second round, ending the possibility of a fifth consecutive treble. As calls were made for Lennon to be sacked and fans began to protest outside Celtic Park following their elimination from the League Cup, the board of directors released a statement on 7 December in which they voiced full support of Lennon and his back room staff.[121] After a brief turnaround in results, Celtic lost the second Old Firm game of the season on 2 January, and calls were once again made for Lennon to be removed from his position as hopes of a historic tenth title faded.\n\nLennon was also criticised for taking the squad on a training trip to Dubai in January, during which two players contracted COVID-19;[122] health protocols meant that 13 players and three coaches, including Lennon, had to be quarantined for 10 days after they returned.[122] They consequently missed league matches with Hibernian and Livingston, both of which were drawn.[122] There were more fan protests after a home defeat by St Mirren, the first time the Paisley club had won at Celtic Park since 1990.[123][124] Despite previously stating that he would not resign, Lennon left the club on 24 February 2021 following a 1\u20130 defeat to Ross County, which left Celtic 18 points behind Rangers in the title race.[125]\n\nOn 8 March 2022, Lennon was appointed head coach of Cypriot First Division side Omonia on a two-and-a-half year deal, replacing former Rangers defender Henning Berg.[126] On 25 May, Lennon led the club to their first trophy under his leadership, as they defeated Ethnikos Achna on penalties to win the Cypriot Cup; during extra time, Lennon received a red card and was ordered to leave the touchline by the referee.[127]\n\nAhead of the 2022\u201323 season, Lennon recruited players who he had managed at former clubs, including Adam Matthews and Gary Hooper (Celtic) and Brandon Barker (Hibernian).[128][129][130] After defeat in the Cypriot Super Cup to Apollon Limassol,[131] Lennon's Omonia team shocked Belgian side Gent 4\u20130 on aggregate to qualify for the UEFA Europa League group stage.[132] Despite respectable showings against Manchester United and Real Sociedad in the group stage, Lennon was sacked on 18 October 2022 due to disappointing results in the domestic league, including losses to newly-promoted sides Akritas Chlorakas and Nea Salamis.[133][134]\n\nLennon has spoken about having suffered from depression since 2000.[135]\n\nIn January 2011, Lennon reached an out of court settlement with the Bank of Ireland after a company of which he was a director defaulted on a \u20ac3.7 million loan.[136]\n\nWhile a young player at Crewe, Lennon was a friend of Andy Woodward and Steve Walters, both of whom were victims of sexual abuse by coach Barry Bennell. After Bennell's 2018 conviction, Lennon spoke of his regret at not being aware of the abuse at the time.[137]\n\nHe is a supporter of his home-town team Lurgan Celtic.[138]\n\nCrewe Alexandra\n\nLeicester City\n\nCeltic\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nIndividual\n\nCeltic\n\nHibernian\n\nOmonia\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Lennon"}, {"id": 12, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/51/1014076/original/francesco-totti-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Francesco Totti", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/francesco-totti/1014076", "desc": "Francesco Totti  (Italian pronunciation: [fran\u02c8t\u0283esko \u02c8t\u0254tti]; born 27 September 1976) is an Italian former professional footballer who played for Roma and the Italy national team.

He is often referred to as Er Bimbo de Oro (The Golden Boy), L'Ottavo Re di Roma (The Eighth King of Rome), Er Pupone (The Big Baby), and Il Capitano (The Captain) by the Italian sports media. A creative offensive playmaker who could play as an attacking midfielder and as a forward (second striker, lone striker, or winger), renowned for his vision, technique, and goalscoring ability, Totti is considered to be one of the best players of his generation.[7]\n\nTotti spent his entire career at Roma, winning a Serie A title, two Coppa Italia titles, and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. He is the second-highest scorer of all time in Italian league history with 250 goals, and is the sixth-highest scoring Italian in all competitions with 316 goals.[8] Totti is the top goalscorer and the most capped player in Roma's history, holds the record for the most goals scored in Serie A while playing for a single club, and also holds the record for the youngest club captain in the history of Serie A. In November 2014, Totti extended his record as the oldest goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history, aged 38 years and 59 days.\n\nA 2006 FIFA World Cup winner and UEFA Euro 2000 finalist with Italy, Totti was selected in the All-Star team for both tournaments; he also represented his country at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. In 2007, Totti announced his international retirement due to recurring physical problems[9] and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma.[10]\n\nTotti won a record eleven Oscar del Calcio awards from the Italian Footballers' Association: five Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Goal of the Year awards, one Serie A Goalscorer of the Year award, and one Serie A Young Footballer of the Year award. He also won the 2007 European Golden Shoe and the 2010 Golden Foot. Totti was selected in the European Sports Media team of the season three times.  In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world's greatest living players as selected by Pel\u00e9, as part of FIFA's centenary celebrations.[11] In 2011, Totti was recognised by IFFHS as the most popular footballer in Europe.[12] In 2015, France Football rated him as one of the ten-best footballers in the world who are over age 36.[13] Following his retirement in 2017, Totti was awarded the Player's Career Award and the UEFA President's Award.\n\nTotti was born in Rome to parents Lorenzo and Fiorella Totti. He was raised in the Porta Metronia neighbourhood.[14] As a youngster he idolised ex-Roma captain Giuseppe Giannini,[15] and regularly played football with older boys.[16] Totti began to play youth team football in 1984, with Fortitudo, later joining Trastevere and Lodigiani. After he came to the attention of scouts, his mother refused a lucrative offer from Milan in order to keep him in his home town. Although his youth club initially had come to an agreement to sell Totti to the Lazio youth side, one of Roma's youth coaches, Gildo Giannini, persuaded his parents to let him join the Roma youth squad in 1989.[14]\n\nAfter three years in the youth team, Totti made his first appearance for Roma's senior side in Serie A at the age of 16, when coach Vujadin Bo\u0161kov called him up in the 2\u20130 away victory against Brescia on 28 March 1993.[17] In the following season under Carlo Mazzone, Totti began to play more regularly as a second striker,[18] and scored his first goal on 4 September 1994 in a 1\u20131 draw against Foggia.[16][19] By 1995, Totti had become a regular in Roma's starting line-up and scored 16 goals during the next three seasons, while creating several more, as his talent was praised by his manager Mazzone.[18][20]\n\nFollowing Mazzone's sacking in the summer of 1996 and the departure of Giannini, Totti was expected to play a more prominent role, after several promising seasons; however, the team underperformed during the 1996\u201397 season, while Totti struggled to gain playing time under new manager Carlos Bianchi, and was even set to leave for Sampdoria on loan in January 1997. Roma's chairman at the time however, Franco Sensi, impeded the transfer, leading to further tensions with the manager, who eventually parted ways with the club.[16][21]\n\nTotti's years under Zden\u011bk Zeman represented a period of both physical and mental maturation as a player. From a technical and tactical standpoint, he proved to be compatible on the left wing in the rigid formations of the Bohemian coach, as his new role gave him more space to take on defenders in one on one situations, and cut into the centre to shoot on goal with his stronger foot;[16][18] he also became physically more powerful, fit, hard-working, and complete.[22] He displayed a greater responsibility for the team, and was presented with the number 10 jersey.[16][23] His first season under Zeman started well, with Totti taking advantage of a 4\u20133\u20133 formation and making his breakthrough with the club.[24] He finished the league season reaching double figures in goals scored for the first time in his career;[21] including a goal in the club's 2\u20130 away win against Napoli on 22 February 1998,[25] Totti scored 13 goals in Serie A in total,[26] and contributed to Roma's fourth place league finish that year.[27] Although he was not called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup by Italy manager Cesare Maldini,[28] his consistent performances, creativity and goalscoring throughout the course of the previous Serie A season saw him being awarded the Guerin d'Oro for the 1997\u201398 season, given to him for having achieved the highest average rating of any Serie A player.[29] The following season, he began to gain recognition as a club symbol and as a leader,[16] and on 31 October 1998, Totti became the official team captain, and the youngest Serie A club captain ever at the age of 22, inheriting the armband from Aldair.[30] On 29 November 1998, Totti scored the equalising goal in a 3\u20133 draw against cross-city rivals Lazio; this was his first ever goal in the Rome Derby.[16][31] Overall, he scored 30 goals and provided 26 assists during Zeman's two-year managerial stint.[16] For his performances, he was named the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year for the 1998\u201399 season.[1]\n\nIn June 1999, Roma's then-president Franco Sensi sacked Zeman and signed Fabio Capello as a replacement, with the aim of winning the league title.[32] By the 2000\u201301 campaign under the new coach, Roma were building a competitive team around Totti, who was by now being utilised as a creative attacking midfielder by Capello in a 3\u20134\u20131\u20132 formation, due to his passing skills and playmaking abilities.[33][34][35] Totti scored in a 2\u20130 home win over Bologna on his season debut on 1 October 2000.[36] On 10 December, Totti scored the match-winning goal in a 2\u20131 home win against Udinese with a powerful left-footed volley to help Roma to their fifth home win of the season.[37] He continued his goalscoring form by scoring against Napoli at home in a 3\u20130 victory on 28 January 2001, as Roma finished the first half of the league season in first place.[38][39] Totti continued to play an important role in keeping the club at the top of the table throughout the remainder of the season, gaining a comfortable lead over rivals Juventus.[40] On 17 June 2001, at the Stadio Olimpico, Roma beat Parma 3\u20131, with their three main attackers, Totti, Vincenzo Montella and Gabriel Batistuta scoring one goal each, as Roma were crowned champions of Italy for the third time in their history.[41] Totti finished the league season with 13 goals, equalling what was at the time his personal goalscoring record in a single Serie A season.[16]\n\nOn 19 August 2001, Totti won his first Supercoppa Italiana, scoring and assisting in the 3\u20130 win against Fiorentina.[42] Totti was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for both 2000 and 2001,[43][44] and won the Serie A Footballer of the Year Award for the first time in his career in 2000.[29] He received his first Ballon d'Or nomination in 2000, finishing 14th in voting, and fifth the following year.[45] Due to his performances and leadership, Totti had established himself as a hero to the Roma fans, who were also able to identify with his background as a Roma native and lifelong supporter.[16]\n\nOver the following seasons, Totti played in a free role as either a forward or second striker in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation, often alongside either Batistuta or the newly acquired youngster Antonio Cassano.[18] He scored his first hat-trick in Serie A, in a 3\u20132 away win over Brescia on 30 September 2002.[46] Totti also scored the only goal in Roma's decisive 1\u20130 victory at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium against Real Madrid on 30 October 2002; this was the first time in 35 years that an Italian team had won a match in Madrid.[47] He continued his goalscoring exploits against Valencia, scoring two goals in Roma's 3\u20130 win.[48] Despite this, Roma only finished third in their Champions League group, and in eighth position in Serie A,[49] although they managed to reach the 2003 Coppa Italia final. In the final against Milan, Totti scored three times from free kicks over both legs (one goal at home and two at the San Siro), but Roma lost out to Milan 6\u20133 on aggregate.[50] In 2003, Totti won his second Serie A Footballer of the Year Award.[29]\n\nIn the 2003\u201304 season, Totti played a key role as Roma finished runner-up to Milan in the Scudetto race.[51] Throughout the league season, he scored 20 goals, his best haul in Serie A up to that point, which allowed him to win his second Guerin d'Oro as the player with the best average rating in Serie A throughout the season.[29] Moreover, the Roma captain notably scored trademark chipped goals on two occasions throughout the season, against Brescia and Empoli.[52]\n\nDespite Roma's disappointing 2004\u201305 season, which saw the departure of a number of players and several managerial changes,[53][54] Totti maintained consistent form by scoring 12 goals in Serie A,[2] and 15 in all competitions, among which was his 100th Serie A goal from a free kick in a 3\u20133 draw against Internazionale, on 3 October 2004.[55] Two months later, on 19 December, he became Roma's all-time leading scorer in Serie A after netting his 107th career league goal against Parma, breaking the record previously held by Roberto Pruzzo.[56] Although Roma finished the league season in eighth place,[57] Totti helped the team reach the 2005 Coppa Italia final; however Roma lost to Inter.[58]\n\nRoma's new coach for the 2005\u201306 season, Luciano Spalletti, went with a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation, deploying Totti in a newer, more offensive role as a lone striker.[18] Despite his new attacking role, Totti usually dropped deep to pick up the ball in midfield rather than operating in the penalty area, thus creating space for the attacking midfielders and wingers to making offensive runs; the resulting system was later described as a 4\u20136\u20130, while Totti's particular attacking role was dubbed the \"false 9\".[16][59] In this new position, Totti continued to score frequently, managing 15 goals in 24 league matches. In the spring of 2005, he renewed his contract until 2010, with an annual salary of \u20ac5.4\u00a0million.[60] On 19 February 2006, he suffered a fracture of his left fibula and ligament damage during a match against Empoli after being fouled by Richard Vanigli.[61] Totti was at risk of missing the 2006 World Cup, but returned to the side on 11 May 2006 as a substitute in Roma's 3\u20131 Coppa Italia final defeat to Inter.[62] A metal plate had been attached to his ankle during surgery, but doctors decided not to operate again and remove it following Totti's return, concurring that the plate would not affect his game.[63] He was given off-label treatments of teriparatide to speed-up his fracture recovery.[64]\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season was a personal high for Totti as he scored 26 goals in Serie A, as well as another six between the Champions League (scoring three times in the group stage and once in the round of 16 tie against Lyon) and the Coppa Italia, in addition to 15 assists in 50 games across all competitions.[16] Despite their elimination from the Champions League by Manchester United in the quarter-finals, and a second-place finish in the league, Roma won the Coppa Italia final against league champions Inter with a 6\u20132 victory at home (Totti scored the opening goal after 50 seconds) and a 2\u20131 defeat at the San Siro in Milan.[16][65] Totti finished the season as Serie A top scorer with 26 goals,[66] and on 17 June, he also received the ESM European Golden Shoe award as the top European goalscorer of the season.[67] Despite being the highest active goalscorer in Serie A, he was not among the finalists for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year[68] due to his absence from the national team, although he was nominated for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, finishing tenth in the voting.[69]\n\nOn 19 August 2007, Totti contributed to Roma's 1\u20130 victory over Inter in the 2007 Supercoppa Italiana, winning a penalty which was subsequently converted by Daniele De Rossi.[70] Totti scored his 200th goal for Roma in a 4\u20130 victory against Torino in the Coppa Italia, on 16 January 2008.[71] He was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for the fifth time in his career on 28 January.[44] The following month, on 24 February, he reached 386 appearances in Serie A with Roma in a match against Fiorentina, equalling the club appearance record previously held by Giacomo Losi, Roma's captain in the 1960s. He broke the record on 27 February, in the club's following league match against Inter.[72][73] On 9 March, he reached his 500th overall appearance for Roma, scoring the second goal of the match from a penalty kick in a 2\u20130 away win over Napoli.[74] Totti suffered a season-ending injury to his right knee during a 1\u20131 draw with Livorno on 19 April. Tests revealed a tear of his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) that required surgery, ruling him out for four months.[75] Roma won their ninth Coppa Italia with a 2\u20131 victory over Inter on 24 May; although Totti did not play the match, he was still allowed to lift the cup as the team's captain.[76][77] With this win, Totti became the most successful captain in the club's history, with five titles and ten runners-up medals.[78]\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, Totti recovered from the previous injury, and took part in the 2008 Supercoppa Italiana final on 24 August 2008; following a 2\u20132 draw with Inter after extra-time, Totti missed his penalty in the resulting shootout, which allowed Javier Zanetti to win the match for Inter with the following spot-kick.[79] On 8 November 2008, he made his 400th appearance in Serie A, in a 1\u20131 away draw against Bologna, scoring the opening goal of the match.[80] Later that month, he went on to help his team beat Lazio in the Rome derby, assisting J\u00falio Baptista's match-winning goal.[81] Totti's run of good form continued as he provided assists for Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107 and scored a lobbed goal in a 3\u20130 win in a league game against Lecce on 23 November,[82] while he netted a free kick in a 3\u20131 away win against CFR Cluj in the Champions League later that week, on 27 November.[83] He also scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win against Bordeaux on 10 December, which ensured Roma's passage to the round of 16 of the competition as group winners.[84] On 19 April 2009, Totti scored his 175th Serie A goal in a 3\u20132 home win over Lecce, overtaking Amedeo Amadei as Roma's all-time highest goalscorer; with the goal, Totti also became one of the top-ten goalscorers in Serie A history.[85]\n\nRoma's difficult start to the 2008\u201309 season and continued struggles at the start of the 2009\u201310 season saw Spalletti resign after his four-year reign and he was replaced by Claudio Ranieri.[86] Totti performed well in the inaugural UEFA Europa League; he scored two hat-tricks in the competition that season, first in a 7\u20131 away win against Gent in the third qualifying round[87] and then another in the same scoreline against MFK Ko\u0161ice at the Stadio Olimpico in the play-off round.[88] In Serie A, he also scored three goals against Bari on 22 November 2009, seven years on from his last hat-trick in Serie A.[89][90][91] Eight days later, Totti confirmed he had signed a new five-year playing contract which would see him at the club until 2014, after which he stated he would become a club director for a further five years.[92][93] Roma offered him an annual salary of \u20ac8.9\u00a0million for 2009\u201310 and \u20ac8.6\u00a0million a year for the next four seasons.[94]\n\nWith a 24-match unbeaten run in Serie A, Roma became the only challengers to Inter in the last three rounds for the league title that season,[95] ultimately finishing runners-up after the final game.[96] Despite suffering several injury problems,[97] he surpassed former prolific strikers such as Gabriel Batistuta,[98] Giuseppe Signori,[99] and Kurt Hamrin,[100] putting him in sixth place in the all-time Serie A scoring records.[101] Totti also played in the Coppa Italia final against Inter on 5 May 2010, but received a red card in the closing minutes of the second half for kicking Mario Balotelli; Roma lost the match 0\u20131, thus failing to bring home a record tenth Coppa Italia title.[102]\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Roma suffered yet another defeat to Inter in the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana,[103] continuing their \"traditional\" early struggles, which Totti partly blamed on Ranieri's defensive mindset and failure to develop a consistent set of tactics.[104][105][106] On a personal level, Totti won the Golden Foot award,[107] but Ranieri's lack of faith in him due to his age meant that the captain would spend a lot of time on the substitute's bench in favour of younger forwards, such as Marco Borriello, Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107 and J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez.[108][109] His limited playing time, which included a controversial 91st minute substitution in a 2\u20131 away loss against Sampdoria,[110] resulted in several clashes with Ranieri, and saw him fall out of form, scoring only three league goals in 21 appearances;[111] as a result of his limited appearances, despondence and strenuous relationship with the manager, rumours even circulated in the media that Totti was considering leaving Roma.[112] Following Roma's 4\u20133 loss against Genoa on 20 February 2011, Ranieri resigned as manager, with Totti's former teammate Vincenzo Montella appointed as caretaker coach.[113]\n\nMontella reverted to Spalletti's 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 system and Totti appeared to recapture his best form, finding the net more frequently towards the end of the season.[114][115] On 3 March, Totti was voted the best active Italian player in a poll conducted by La Gazzetta dello Sport; 100 Italian personalities including footballers, politicians and celebrities took part in the vote. On 13 March 2011, he scored two goals against Lazio which gave Roma their fifth consecutive victory in the Rome Derby.[116] The following match, on 20 March, Totti became the sixth player in Serie A history to score 200 goals, finding the target twice in a 2\u20132 draw against Fiorentina to total 201 league goals.[117] On 1 May, Totti scored a brace against Bari to equal and subsequently overtake Roberto Baggio as the fifth-highest goalscorer in Serie A with his 205th and 206th career league goals, putting him behind only Silvio Piola, Gunnar Nordahl, Giuseppe Meazza and Jos\u00e9 Altafini.[118] Totti ended the 2010\u201311 Serie A campaign with 15 goals\u00a0\u2013 with twelve of his goals coming in Roma's last 13 league fixtures.[115]\n\nAt the end of the season, Roma underwent a change of ownership, with the former club owner Rosella Sensi being replaced by an American consortium led by Thomas DiBenedetto.[119] Under the new management, the club did not offer a permanent contract to Montella, which led to him leaving to coach another Serie A side, Catania.[120] The Roma management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B side, in a bid to emulate Barcelona's football style.[121]\n\nThe 2011\u201312 season saw Totti initially receive few starts under Roma's new manager Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued.[122] Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 in the second half of a match against Atalanta, which kept him out of action until 20 November;[123] he returned to the pitch against Lecce, when he came off the bench in the 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2\u20131.[124]\n\nIn mid-December, as Totti began regaining form post-injury, he started playing more regularly, often in a creative role as an attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1\u20131 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match.[125] He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3\u20131 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011,[126] and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium.[127] Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.[16][128][129][130]\n\nOn 8 January 2012, Totti scored his first goals of the season in a 2\u20130 win against Chievo, converting one penalty in the first half and another in the second.[131] He went on to score two goals in a 5\u20131 win against Cesena which allowed Totti to set a new record, as his second goal of the match brought his tally to 211 league goals\u00a0\u2013 the most any player has ever scored for a single club in Serie A.[132] Despite his inability to find the back of the net as the second half of the season began, he continued to perform well, as he notably assisted Juan's goal from a corner in Roma's 4\u20130 win over Inter on 5 February.[133] On 12 April, Totti scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3\u20131 victory over Udinese.[134] He scored again in a 2\u20131 loss against Fiorentina on 25 April,[135] and two weeks later, on his 500th match in Serie A, he scored two goals in a 2\u20132 draw against Catania at the Stadio Olimpico.[136]\n\nAfter Luis Enrique decided to resign due to an unsuccessful season in which Roma failed to qualify for European football for the first time in 15 years, the club decided to appoint their former manager Zden\u011bk Zeman, with whom Totti would once again be reunited. Zeman tried to play Totti in a free role as a left forward or winger in his preferred 4\u20133\u20133 tactical line-up.[137] Although this was a similar role to that which he had played during Zeman's previous spell 13 years before, Totti's freedom also enabled him to drop deep into the midfield to press opponents and pick up the ball, as well as attacking on the left wing.[138] On 2 September, Totti provided 2 assists for Alessandro Florenzi and Dani Osvaldo in Roma's 3\u20131 win over Inter at the San Siro. After the match, he received praise from the media due to his performance, even as he approached his 36th birthday.[139] On 21 October, Totti surpassed both Giuseppe Meazza and Jos\u00e9 Altafini's joint-record after scoring the first of Roma's goals in a 4\u20132 away win at Genoa, becoming the third-highest scorer in Serie A history with 217 goals.[140] On 8 December, Totti scored two goals, his fifth and sixth of the season, in a 4\u20132 home victory against Fiorentina.[141]\n\nFollowing the club's negative performances, Zeman was sacked and replaced by the club's technique coach Aurelio Andreazzoli in early February 2013.[142][143] Under his new manager, Totti scored a goal against Juventus on 16 February, with a powerful strike, as Roma shocked the league leaders in a 1\u20130 win.[144] On 3 March, he scored his 225th goal against Genoa to become Serie A's joint second-top scorer \u2013 alongside Gunnar Nordahl \u2013 as Roma cruised to a 3\u20131 victory.[145] Totti finally broke Nordahl's record by scoring against Parma on 18 March, increasing his Serie A tally to 226 goals.[146] On 8 April, with a goal from a penalty kick in the 1\u20131 draw against Lazio, he became the joint top scorer of all time in Serie A in the Rome Derby with nine goals, putting him on par with Dino da Costa and Marco Delvecchio.[147] Totti finished the 2012\u201313 Serie A season with 12 goals and 12 assists from 34 appearances.[148] Totti also reached the 2013 Coppa Italia final with Roma, but lost the match 0\u20131 on 26 May to cross-city rivals Lazio.[149]\n\nWith the arrival of Roma's new coach Rudi Garcia in the summer of 2013, Totti was once again deployed as a false 9, while also functioning as a supporting forward, or as winger on the left on occasion.[16] On 20 September 2013, Roma announced that Totti had signed a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2016, past his 39th birthday.[150] He scored his first goal of the 2013\u201314 season on 16 September, against Parma in a 3\u20131 victory.[151] He followed up the goal with two strikes in Roma's 3\u20130 away victory over Inter, helping the team maintain a 100% record after seven games.[152] On 20 November, he received the \"Captain of Captains\" award by the association Editutto and Baker Tilly Revisa.[153]\n\nOn 14 February, Totti was sidelined for about a month after sustaining a bruised right buttock.[154] He returned to the pitch on 17 March against Udinese, scoring the first goal of the match as he helped his team to a 3\u20132 win.[155] Eight days later, Totti celebrated 700 overall appearances with Roma against Torino.[156] On 2 April, he scored his 20th career goal against Parma (a personal record against any side) in a 4\u20132 victory.[157] He finished the season with eight goals and ten assists, ending the year as the top assist provider of the 2013\u201314 Serie A season.[158]\n\nPrior to the start of the 2014\u201315 season, Totti had been one of the star players of Roma's pre-season friendlies.[159]\nOn 30 September 2014, three days after his 38th birthday, Totti scored Roma's equaliser in a Champions League group stage draw at Manchester City, thus becoming the oldest scorer in the UEFA Champions League history;[160] it was also Totti's 300th professional career goal.[161][162] On 25 October, Totti scored the opening goal from a free kick in a 1\u20131 draw against CSKA Moscow, extending his record of oldest goalscorer in the history of the competition to 38 years and 59 days.[163]\n\nOn 11 January 2015, Totti scored two goals against local rivals Lazio, making him the joint all-time top scorer in the Rome Derby in official club competitions, alongside Dino Da Costa, with 11 goals, as well as the Serie A top scorer in the Rome Derby.[164][165] On 9 May, Totti scored from a penalty in a 2\u20131 away defeat to Milan, equalling Roberto Baggio for the record of the most goals scored in Serie A from penalties (68).[166][167] On 31 May, in the final match-day of the 2014\u201315 season, he scored his 299th goal for Roma in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Palermo.[168] Totti finished the season as Roma's leading scorer with ten goals in all competitions, the seventh time in which he had been the team's top scorer.[169]\n\nOn his second league appearance of the 2015\u201316 Serie A season, Totti scored his 300th career club goal in all competitions with Roma in a 2\u20132 home draw with Sassuolo, on 20 September 2015.[170] On 26 September 2015, the day before his 39th birthday, he sustained an injury, straining his right hip flexor in a 5\u20131 win over Carpi, ruling him out for three months.[171] He returned to the pitch as a substitute in a 1\u20131 home draw against Milan, on 9 January 2016,[172] equalling Gianluca Pagliuca as the third all-time highest appearance holder in Serie A history, with 592 appearances.[173]\n\nOn 21 February 2016, Totti publicly criticised returning manager \u2013 and Rudi Garcia's replacement \u2013 Luciano Spalletti in the media for his lack of playing time since his return from injury. He was subsequently dropped for Roma's 5\u20130 win over Palermo, with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and in the media,[174] while rumours once again began to circulate that Totti would be leaving the club once his contract had expired at the end of the season, as a result of his limited appearances and clashes with Spalletti.[175] On 8 March, Totti came on as a substitute for Stephan El Shaarawy in the return leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid, and was given a standing ovation by the fans at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in Madrid; Roma lost the match 2\u20130, however, and were eliminated from the competition following a 4\u20130 aggregate loss.[176] On 20 April, he came off the bench in the 86th minute, one goal down to Torino at home to rescue the team with a brace; one in the 87th minute and a penalty in the 89th minute to win the match 3\u20132.[177] With his 69th goal in Serie A from the penalty spot, he overtook Roberto Baggio as the outright top scorer of penalties in Serie A history.[178] Totti's double also made him the oldest player in Serie A history to score two goals in a single league match, at the age of 39 years, 6 months and 23 days, breaking Silvio Piola's previous record of 39 years, 4 months and 2 days, which he had managed with Novara on 1 February 1953, after scoring a brace against his former team Lazio.[179]\n\nOn 2 May, Totti came off the bench and scored from a free kick to help Roma to come from behind and achieve a 3\u20132 away win over Genoa; this was his 21st goal from a free kick in Serie A, which put him alongside Baggio as the joint all-time fourth-highest scorer of free kicks in Serie A history, behind only Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo, and Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107. Totti came off the bench in each of the past five Serie A games and contributed four goals and an assist.[180][181] On 8 May, Totti came off the bench to set up Roma's final goal in a 3\u20130 home win over Chievo in his 600th Serie A appearance, becoming the third player ever to reach this milestone.[182][183] Overall, Totti only made 13 league appearances throughout the season but scored four goals in the final six matches as a substitute.[184] On 7 June, he renewed his contract for another year, stating that he would be retiring at the end of the 2016\u201317 season;[184][185] he also revealed he had signed a six-year contract as Roma's technical director once the season ends.[186]\n\nOn his first appearance of the 2016\u201317 season against Sampdoria on 11 September, Totti equalled Paolo Maldini's record of playing in 25 Serie A seasons. With Roma trailing 2\u20131 at half time, Totti came off the bench and assisted Edin D\u017eeko's temporary equaliser, later also scoring the match-winning goal from a penalty in injury time to secure a 3\u20132 home win in Serie A; Totti's goal meant that he had managed to score at least once in each of the past 23 consecutive seasons of his career.[187] On 25 September, he scored his 250th Serie A goal from the penalty spot in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Torino, just two days before his 40th birthday.[188] On his first start two days after his 40th birthday, on 29 September, Totti was praised for his performance and longevity in a 4\u20130 home win over Astra Giurgiu in the Europa League; he played all 90 minutes of the match, providing two assists, while also being involved in a third goal.[189] On 20 October, Totti made his 100th appearance in UEFA club competitions, setting up two goals in a 3\u20133 home draw against Austria Wien in the Europa League.[190] In late October, he sustained a muscle injury to the flexor of his left thigh during a training session, which ruled him out indefinitely.[191] He returned to action as a substitute in a 3\u20132 home win over Pescara on 27 November.[192]\n\nOn 1 February 2017, Totti scored a decisive injury-time penalty in the 97th minute of a 2\u20131 home victory against Cesena in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals; the win enabled Roma to advance to the semi-finals of the tournament.[193] On 15 April, he came on as a substitute in a 1\u20131 home draw against Atalanta to make his 615th appearance in Serie A, equalling Javier Zanetti as the joint third highest appearance holder of all time in Serie A.[194]\n\nOn 28 May, Totti made his final appearance for Roma in a 3\u20132 home win against Genoa, coming on as a substitute for Mohamed Salah in the 54th minute and received a standing ovation from the fans.[195]\n\nTotti first came into international prominence while playing in FIFA and UEFA youth tournaments. With the Italy under-16 side, under manager Sergio Vatta, Totti reached the final of the 1993 UEFA European Under-16 Championship in Turkey; Italy were defeated 1\u20130 by Poland as Totti missed the final due to suspension.[196] Four months later, Totti played in 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan and scored Italy's goal in the tournament as the Azzurrini were eliminated in group stage.[197] Totti also scored in Italy's 4\u20131 defeat to Spain in the final of the UEFA Under-18 Championship, in July 1995.[198] He subsequently won the UEFA Under-21 Championship with Italy in 1996, under manager Cesare Maldini; in the final, he opened the scoring as the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw against Spain, although Italy were able to win the final on penalties.[199][200] The following year, he also played a key role in helping Italy to win a gold medal at the 1997 Mediterranean Games, on home soil, scoring twice throughout the tournament.[201][202] Due to his contribution in these tournaments, Totti was later included in the all-time Under-21 EURO dream team in 2015.[203]\n\n\nAfter starring with the Azzurrini in Italy's under-16, under-19, and under-21 sides, Totti earned his first senior cap for Italy under the recently appointed international manager Dino Zoff during a 2\u20130 Euro 2000 qualifying victory against Switzerland on 10 October 1998.[204] Totti scored his first goal for Italy on 26 April 2000 in a 2\u20130 friendly win over Portugal in Reggio Calabria.[205] He scored his first brace for Italy in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match in a 4\u20133 home win over Belarus, on 13 October 2004.[206] In total, Totti made 58 appearances for Italy between 1998 and 2006, scoring nine goals and making 24 assists.[10][207]\nItaly went to Euro 2000 with Totti in excellent form. Overall, he scored two goals and provided an assist during the tournament.[208] His first goal of the tournament came against co-host nation Belgium in the first round, as Totti headed in Demetrio Albertini's cross from a set-piece;[209] he was named man of the match for his performance.[210] His second goal of the tournament came against Romania in the quarter-finals, with an accurate strike following Stefano Fiore's assist.[211] In Italy's semi-final shootout victory over co-hosts the Netherlands, Totti's confidently chipped penalty was named as one of the \"magic moments\" of the tournament.[212][213] A few moments before taking the penalty, Totti whispered the famous sentence \"Mo je faccio er Cucchiaio\" (Roman dialect for \"Now I'm scoring with a Panenka\") to his teammate and friend Luigi Di Biagio.[214]\n\nThough Italy lost to reigning World Cup Champions France 2\u20131 in extra time in the final, Totti was named the man of the match, and he started the play which led to Marco Delvecchio's opening goal; Totti sent an unmarked Gianluca Pessotto down the right wing with a back-heel pass, allowing him space to cross the ball into the area, where it was put into the net by Delvecchio.[215][216] Later, during the second half of the match, Totti provided two scoring opportunities for Alessandro Del Piero, which the Juventus forward was unable to convert.[217] Totti was selected for the 22-man Team of the Tournament due to his performances throughout the European Championship.[218]\n\nAfter being handed the number 10 shirt and Italy's playmaking duties, much was expected of Totti in his debut World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni.[219] Despite a promising start at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea, as he set-up Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 2\u20130 opening win over Ecuador,[220] disappointment followed, with Totti failing to score or make a significant impact throughout the tournament. Despite helping to set up Vieri's goal in a disappointing and controversial 2\u20131 defeat to Croatia in Italy's second group match,[221] his lacklustre performances throughout the tournament were later criticised by the Italian media, in particular his failure to capitalise on several scoring chances in Italy's 1\u20131 draw against Mexico in their final group match, as Italy only narrowly qualified for the knockout stage.[222][223]\n\nDespite setting up Vieri's goal in Italy's second round defeat to co-hosts South Korea from a corner,[224] his performance was once again criticised,[225] in particular as he was sent off in extra time after being handed a controversial second yellow card by referee Byron Moreno for simulation.[226]\n\nAlthough he was once again expected to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004. He was subsequently banned until the semi-finals,[227] but never made it back to action and finished the competition scoreless due to Italy's elimination in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.[228]\n\nDespite injury troubles, Totti recovered in time to join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, despite a lack of match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to work even harder to overcome what could have been a career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).[229][230]\n\nTotti did recuperate in time and was eventually named to Lippi's final 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup.[231] Despite initial concerns over his match fitness, Totti was an important player in Marcello Lippi's team,[230][232][233] and played in all seven games for Italy,[234] including the victorious final against France, which Italy won on penalties, although he was substituted off in the 61st minute.[235] He played the entire time in Germany with metal plates and screws in his ankle that had yet to be removed following the surgery.[230][232][233] Throughout the tournament, he usually played as an attacking midfielder, in front of deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo, and behind strikers Luca Toni, Alberto Gilardino, Vincenzo Iaquinta, or Filippo Inzaghi; these players were supported defensively by Gennaro Gattuso, Simone Perrotta and Daniele De Rossi in midfield.[234] Totti finished the tournament with the joint-highest number of assists, along with Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme (4).[236] Totti set up Pirlo's goal from a short corner in Italy's opening 2\u20130 win against Ghana,[237][238] Marco Materazzi's goal from a corner in Italy's final group match, a 2\u20130 win against the Czech Republic,[239] and two goals in a 3\u20130 win against Ukraine in the quarter-finals: the opener by Gianluca Zambrotta, and one of Luca Toni's goals.[240] Totti also scored a goal via an injury-time penalty in Italy's 1\u20130 round of 16 win over Australia on 26 June,[241] and was involved in Del Piero's last-minute extra-time goal in the semi-final, which sealed a 2\u20130 victory for the Italians over hosts Germany, and a place in the World Cup final.[242] Throughout the competition, Totti completed 185 passes and took 19 shots;[234] in recognition of a successful tournament, he was selected for the 23-man All-Star Team.[243]\n\nTotti intended to retire from international football after the 2006 World Cup, but reneged on his decision and remained undecided on his future for over a year, not being called up in the meantime. He made his retirement official on 20 July 2007, at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 Serie A season, due to recurring physical problems[9] and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma.[10] Italy's coach at the time, Roberto Donadoni, attempted to get Totti to change his mind for the remaining Euro 2008 qualifiers but was not successful.[244]\n\nAfter Marcello Lippi's reappointment as the national team's manager following Euro 2008, Totti announced that he would play in the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa if he were to receive a call-up;[245] however, there was no official statement release from Totti or Lippi about a possible comeback.[246] For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon said one of the reasons for Italy's early exit was due to the lack of creative players like Totti in the team.[247]\n\nIn March 2013, Lippi's successor as Italy's coach, Cesare Prandelli, stated that he would consider Totti for the 2014 World Cup squad.[248][249] In October 2013, Prandelli said, \"Totti is in fantastic form. His condition right now does make you reflect. If the World Cup was around the corner, I would have no doubts and would absolutely call him up. But we will evaluate the player's condition one month prior to the World Cup.\"[250] However, at the time of the choice of the final 23-man Italian squad for the World Cup, the Italy coach excluded the Roma striker, preferring to focus the team around younger players.[251] Some in the media criticised the decision, such as former Brazilian international footballer Cafu, who had been Totti's teammate at Roma, who revealed that he would have liked to see Totti competing for Italy at the World Cup in Brazil, and that he preferred the Roma captain over Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.[252] Without Totti, Italy was eliminated in the first round for the second consecutive time, finishing third in their group.[253][254]\n\nIn May 2016, several injuries in the Italian squad, as well as a lack of attacking options and Totti's run of good form as a substitute for Roma, led some in the media to call for manager Antonio Conte to include Totti as a reserve in Italy's Euro 2016 squad; however, he was later left out of Conte's 30-man preliminary Italy squad for the final tournament.[255][256]\n\n\"A great player! What a phenomenon!\"\n\n\u2014 Lionel Messi comments on Totti after the 50th anniversary of the Joan Gamper trophy, between Barcelona and Roma.[257][258][259]\n\n\"Totti is an artist of football, a true Number 10.\"\n\n\u2014 Michel Platini, former French midfielder and former UEFA President.[260]\n\n\"Totti is immortal and he is a symbol of our sport. I only regret not having worked with him.\"\n\n\u2014 Carlo Ancelotti, former Italian midfielder and four time Champions League winning football manager.[261]\n\nOften referred to as Er Bimbo de Oro (The Golden Boy), L'Ottavo Re di Roma (The Eighth King of Rome), Er Pupone (The Big Baby), Il Capitano (The Captain), and Il Gladiatore (The Gladiator) by the Italian sports media,[262][263] Totti is considered to be one of the greatest Italian players of all time,[264][265][266][267][268] one of the best players of his generation,[269][270][271] and Roma's greatest ever player.[272] Totti is also regarded by some as Italy's greatest player ever.[266][267][268] Throughout his career, he played predominantly as a classic number 10, functioning either as an offensive-midfield playmaker or as a supporting or deep-lying forward behind the main striker;[273][274] only in the later years of his Roma career was he mainly employed as a lone striker.[275] An elegant, world-class, and technically gifted attacking midfielder with a good knowledge of the game, Totti was a tactically versatile player, capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and was also occasionally deployed as a winger or as a central midfielder under Zden\u011bk Zeman,[276][277] and most notably as a false 9 under Luciano Spalletti and Rudi Garcia.[59][275][278] Under Luis Enrique, he was also occasionally fielded in a more withdrawn creative role in midfield, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker.[279]\n\nWhile Totti was a prolific goalscorer, he was also renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, as well as his ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time.[280][281][282][283] Due to his movement and range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, unselfish and dynamic centre-forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian (which literally translates to \"manoeuvring centre-forward\").[8][275] Known for his work rate, longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.[16][22][284]\n\nThroughout his career, Totti utilised his balance, dribbling skills, and acceleration in order to get past opponents; despite being naturally right-footed, he possessed a powerful and accurate shot from both inside and outside the area with either foot,[268][273][280][282] and was also an accurate penalty kick[285] and free kick taker,[271][286] who was capable of striking the ball either with power or swerve from set pieces.[287] Totti also scored several goals from chipped shots throughout his career, and often used the technique on penalties, which was also known as the cucchiaio technique (or \"spoon\" in Italian);[288][289] one of the most famous instances in which Totti performed this type of penalty was in the victorious shootout of Italy's Euro 2000 semi-final match against the Netherlands.[288] One of his most famous lobbed goals, in which he dribbled past Inter's Marco Materazzi before chipping the ball over goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, was later named the best goal in Serie A of the 2005\u201306 season.[290] He scored another notable goal using this technique against Lazio in the 2002 Derby della Capitale, which ended in a 5\u20131 win for Roma.[291] The title of Totti's 2006 autobiography Tutto Totti: Mo je faccio er cucchiaio (English: All about Totti: I'm gonna chip him now) referenced this technique, as well as the statement made to his Italy teammates before his memorable Euro 2000 semi-final shootout penalty against the Netherlands.[212][288][292] Having served as Roma's captain for several years, Totti was praised for his leadership.[293]\n\nDespite his talent and ability, however, Totti drew criticism at times for his character and lack of discipline on the pitch, which occasionally caused him to commit bad fouls and receive unnecessary bookings; with eleven red cards, he has the joint-sixth highest number of sending offs in Serie A history.[294][295][296]\n\nTotti was known for his exuberant and humorous goal celebrations. One of his famous celebrations took place on 11 April 1999 in the second Derby della Capitale of the 1998\u201399 season, in which he scored during the final minutes of the game and celebrated by flashing a T-shirt under his jersey, which read \"Vi ho purgato ancora\" (\"I've purged you guys again\"), in reference to events at the previous derby against Lazio on 29 November 1998 when Totti helped Roma come back from 3\u20131 down with an assist to Eusebio Di Francesco for 3\u20132 and finally a goal of his own for 3\u20133.[297] Another derby goal against Lazio saw him take over a sideline camera and aim it at the Roma fans.[297]\n\nTotti has displayed numerous T-shirts with messages on them from under his jersey over the years, including two for his wife; \"6 Unica\" (\"You're One of a kind\") and \"6 Sempre Unica\" (\"You're Still the One\"),[297] and a political one \"Liberate Giuliana\" (\"Free Giuliana\") in honor of Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian journalist kidnapped in 2005 by insurgents in Iraq who was later freed. The most recent message was \"Scusate il Ritardo\" (\"Sorry for the delay\") which he flashed on 8 January 2012 as an apology to fans for his goalscoring drought after scoring his first goal of the season versus Chievo.[297]\n\nAs a tribute to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a childbirth scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and lying on his back while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the birth of his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children.[298][299] On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2\u20130 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.[300]\n\nOn 17 July 2017, Totti confirmed his retirement from professional football and announced that he had accepted an offer from his former team Roma to become a club director.[301] On 18 September, Totti began studying for a course in order to obtain his UEFA B coaching licence.[302] However, he withdrew from the course two weeks later, as he was unable to attend the course regularly due to his commitments as a director of Roma; his former teammate Simone Perrotta took his place.[303]\n\nOn 17 June 2019, he announced his resignations from his managerial role at AS Roma, in an hour-long press conference held at the Italian Olympic Committee headquarters where he publicly accused chairman James Pallotta and the management for not involving him enough into the club's decision making, up to the point of stating he would reconsider a comeback only under a different ownership. The events marked the end for his 30-year long formal association with the club.[304][305]\n\nTotti married Ilary Blasi, a former showgirl and a co-host of Italia 1's Le Iene, on 19 June 2005 at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Their wedding was aired on television with the proceeds being donated to charity. They had their first child, Cristian, on 6 November 2005. Their second child, a daughter named Chanel, was born on 13 May 2007. The couple has often been referred to as the \"Italian Beckhams\" and their private lives are often speculated upon in Italian magazines and tabloids.[306] On 10 March 2016, the couple had their third child, Isabel.[307] On 11 July 2022, it was announced that Totti and Blasi had separated.[308] Totti is a Roman Catholic.[16][309]\n\nTotti's brother Riccardo serves as his agent,[16][310] and manages many of his brand and business interests, under the name Number Ten, including the Francesco Totti Academy, a football training school, and the Totti Soccer School, a football camp for children with disabilities. Totti also owns a motorcycle racing team called Totti Top Sport.[311]\n\nOn 12 October 2020, Totti's father, Enzo, died at 76 years old due to COVID-19 amid its pandemic in Italy.[312]\n\nTotti became a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF in 2003,[313][314] and an ambassador for the FIFA/SOS Children's Villages in January 2006. As a fundraiser for a children's charity, he published two best-selling, self-effacing joke books containing jokes the locals often told about him and his teammates. Some of the jokes were filmed in short sketches featuring himself with good friends and national teammates Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Christian Vieri, Antonio Cassano, Marco Delvecchio, Alessandro Nesta and former national team coach Giovanni Trapattoni in a short show called La sai l'ultima di Totti. On 16 January 2008, he appeared as \"PaperTotti\" in the Disney comic series Topolino. The proceeds of the subscriptions were given to charity. The Roma captain's official testimonial was a fund raising match between singers and celebrities played on 12 May 2008 to help raise money for the construction of the Campus Produttivo della Legalit\u00e0 e della Solidariet\u00e0 (Productive Campus of Legality and Solidarity).[315]\n\nIn 2009, Totti helped launch a new campaign promoting Football Adopting Abandoned Children, which came about in collaboration with the Friends of Children and the Association of Italian Players. In the project, he adopted a team of around 11 young Kenyans to play football in Nairobi, and then to coach them along the way.[316] In 2015, Totti and several of his teammates took to the pitch for \"Tennis with Stars\" in the Foro Italico in Rome, an event to help disadvantaged children. Tennis players such as Novak Djokovic and Flavia Pennetta participated at the event.[317] On 27 September 2016, Totti celebrated his 40th birthday live on his new Facebook page,[318] at the Tor Crescenza castle in Rome.[319]\n\nTotti recorded a video message for a comatose hospital patient who awoke from her coma when his voice was played; Totti visited the patient in the hospital in September 2020.[320]\n\nIn 2002, Fiat principal executive Gianni Agnelli, a lifelong fan and ex-president of Juventus, chose Totti to publicize the launch of the new Stilo instead of a Juventus player.[321] Having been signed to sportswear company Nike, Totti featured in Nike's \"Secret Tournament\" advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, in the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan.[322] He appeared alongside Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Lu\u00eds Figo, Roberto Carlos and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\".[322][323]\n\nTotti has featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he starred on the cover of the Italian edition of FIFA 2002.[324] He also featured on the cover of Pro Evolution Soccer 4 along with Thierry Henry and Italian referee Pierluigi Collina.[325] Between 2005 and 2008, his sponsors changed to sportswear company Diadora and soft drink Pepsi Twist, with a commercial filmed in the camps of Trigoria by director Gabriele Muccino. Since May 2006, he has appeared in advertisements for telephone company Vodafone. In December 2006 Totti and his wife Ilary Blasi lent their voices to an Italian dubbing of an episode of the television series The Simpsons entitled \"Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play\", in which Totti voiced Buck Mitchell.[326]\nIn 2007, he appeared in the movie L'allenatore nel Pallone 2 in the role of a defense attorney. Since 2008, he has participated several times in the television program C'\u00e8 posta per te, in the second series of the Italian drama Cesaroni, in the reality show Grande Fratello 8 and in an episode of Paperissima. In September 2008, a collection of figurines dedicated to him appeared in newsstands in the Lazio region entitled \"Francesco Totti, the captain\".[327] In 2009, Totti sent a message of support to Iranian youths during the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests.[328][329] In February 2010, Totti was named an ambassador for online poker company Party Poker.[330]\n\nIn May 2010, Totti appeared alongside actor Russell Crowe in Rome to promote the special edition of the film Gladiator, celebrating the tenth year of the film's release.[331] In December 2014, two murals of Totti, sponsored by Nike, were created in Rome.[332][333] In 2014, the Swiss artist David Diehl painted Totti as one of 16 football icons most beloved by their fans.[334][335] In 2015, France Football rated him one of the ten best footballers in the world over the age of 36.[336] In 2015, Totti's famous selfie goal celebration was included amongst the goal celebrations available for FIFA 16 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2016; he also took a selfie in the official trailer of the video game on YouTube.[337][338] On 1 August 2017, a rocket carrying Totti's number 10 shirt from his final game with Roma against Genoa was launched into space from French Guiana.[339]\n\nIn 2020 he was the subject of My Name Is Francesco Totti (Mi chiamo Francesco Totti), a documentary film by Alex Infascelli.[340]\n\nRoma[341]\n\nItaly[341]\n\nItaly Youth\n\nIndividual\n\nOrders\n\nRecords\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Totti"}, {"id": 13, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/43/856064/original/dietmar-hamann-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Dietmar Hamann", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/dietmar-hamann/856064", "desc": "Dietmar Johann Wolfgang Hamann (born 27 August 1973) is a German professional football coach, former player, and media personality.\nThroughout his career, he has played for Bayern Munich, Newcastle United, Liverpool, and Manchester City primarily in a defensive midfield position.

He also spent time at Milton Keynes Dons as a player/coach before joining Leicester City as a first team coach. He was a member of the German national team from 1997 until 2006 and represented his nation in two FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships, reaching the 2002 FIFA World Cup final. He is known in Ireland as a football pundit on Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann's live coverage of major European and International competitions.\n\nThroughout his playing career Hamann gained a reputation for being a highly consistent and reliable player. He is highly respected by supporters of Liverpool due in large part to his involvement in the club's victory in the 2005 UEFA Champions League final.\n\nOn 5 July 2011, Hamann was named as the new manager of Stockport County, replacing former manager Ray Mathias. He resigned from the post on 7 November 2011 after only four months with Stockport struggling in 17th place in the Conference Premier citing failure of a proposed takeover by Tony Evans.\n\nHamann began his career at the little-known FC Wacker M\u00fcnchen. After impressing as a junior, he joined Bayern Munich as a 16-year-old in 1989 and debuted for the Bayern professional team in 1993.[3] Hamann joined a team led by Lothar Matth\u00e4us, Thomas Helmer, Christian Ziege and Oliver Kahn and played five games, mostly as a right winger. At first, Hamann was only a so-called Vertragsamateur (i.e. an amateur player who had the licence for playing professional games). Still, he won his first German championship as a bench player. In the next season, Bayern suffered a major injury wave which claimed midfielders Matth\u00e4us, Swiss international Alain Sutter, talent Dieter Frey and veteran Markus Schupp, which allowed Hamann to become a regular; he played 30 Bundesliga games[3] and established himself as a valuable role player, playing either right wing or defensive midfield. He earned himself a full professional contract and was an important player in the tumultuous 1995\u201396 campaign, in which Bayern recruited striker J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, coach Otto Rehhagel and midfielders Andi Herzog, Thomas Strunz and Ciriaco Sforza, but the team was torn apart by heavy internal struggles. Although Hamann was overshadowed by these new midfield recruits, he played in 20 games and provided some stability for the infighting Bayern squad. Bayern ended a disappointing second and saw Rehhagel sacked, but ended the season by winning the UEFA Cup.\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season was to become Hamann's breakthrough. After being a bench player most of his career until then, new coach Giovanni Trappatoni made him a starting defensive midfielder, and new recruit Mario Basler took the right wing. Hamann played in 23 games, also making his debut in the German national team and won his second German championship with Bayern.[3] In private life, Hamann had to overcome a scary period when he broke down unconscious and was diagnosed with a stroke, but made a full recovery.[4] The next season ended disappointingly for Bayern who lagged behind newly promoted 1. FC Kaiserslautern for the vast majority of the season and finished second. Now an undisputed starter, Hamann played in 28 games and scored two goals.[5] The season ended on a high for Bayern when they secured the DFB-Pokal against MSV Duisburg.\n\nAfter playing for his country in the 1998 World Cup, he joined Newcastle United, managed at the time by Kenny Dalglish, for \u00a35.5 million. Overcoming an early foot injury, Hamann played in 31 matches and scored five goals.[3] In July 1999 he opted to join Gerard Houllier's Liverpool, who signed him for \u00a38 million.[6]\nWhilst at Newcastle he played in the 1999 FA Cup Final.\n\nHamann established himself as an influential midfielder for Liverpool throughout his seven years at the club.  All in all, Hamann played in 191 league games and scored eight goals. In the 2000\u201301 season, Hamann won his first big English trophy when Liverpool won a much-celebrated cup treble (League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup) and a place in the Champions League.[7][8] Hamann also played the full 90 minutes and assisted Liverpool's second goal (scored by Michael Owen) in the team's 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the 2003 Worthington Cup final.[9]\n\nHamann established himself as a major first team player for Liverpool throughout his first few seasons.\n\nHamann played a major part in the 2005 Champions League Final win over A.C. Milan. Although he was suffering a broken toe during the final,[10] Hamann's substitution for Steve Finnan at half time was the catalyst for Liverpool's historic fightback. The team rallied after being 3\u20130 down to bring the game back to 3\u20133 and finally won in the penalty shootout; Hamann also showed a great amount of composure and bravery, as he took and converted the first LFC penalty with his broken foot.[11] This was not the only key part he played in their Champions league success. Earlier in the tournament, Hamann had been forced to stand in for Liverpool's key player Steven Gerrard in the first leg of the last 16 round against Bayer Leverkusen. He excelled in the match and scored a late free-kick as Liverpool won the match 3\u20131.\n\nHamann won the FA Cup with Liverpool in May 2006, coming on as a substitute in the second-half.  He more than played his part in another trophy win for the Reds, who were 3\u20132 down to West Ham United at the time he came on.  Steven Gerrard scored an injury-time leveller for Liverpool to take the match to extra-time.  Liverpool would go on to win the Cup on penalties after a goalless extra-time. Once again, Hamann scored the first penalty in the shoot-out.[12]\n\nIn June 2006, Hamann was given permission to talk to Bolton Wanderers about a potential transfer to the North West club. Hamann admitted that he would be saddened to leave Liverpool but would make \"the best decision for my future\". Hamann actually signed a pre-contract in June 2006, to become a Bolton Wanderers player but had a \"change of heart\".[13] He joined Bolton for less than one day before a move to Manchester City.[14]\n\nOn 12 July, he instead signed for Manchester City, with City agreeing to pay \u00a3400,000 compensation to Bolton.[15] On 13 February, he signed a contract until the end of the 2008\u201309 season and scored his first goal for the club in a UEFA Cup qualifying first round match against EB/Streymur.[16]\n\nHowever, on 28 August 2013 during Colin Murray's morning radio show with TalkSport Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside announced that the club had never officially signed the midfielder and that the necessary papers were \"just put in the draw\". A Premier League investigation found that this wasn't the case and that Bolton had indeed signed Hamann, and expressed confusion as to why Gartside had lied about it.[17]\n\nOn 1 July 2009, he was released by Manchester City as his contract expired.[18] Hamann announced on 16 July that he intended to stay in England.\n\nOn transfer deadline day in September 2009, BBC Sport quoted Hamann as stating: \"Yes, Sven [-G\u00f6ran Eriksson] phoned me the other day to see if I wanted to sign for Notts County, but I said I wasn't interested at the moment as I feel I can still play at a higher level. There are a couple of things in Germany and I'll make my mind up by the end of the week. I have spoken to a couple of teams in England but that hasn't come to anything yet. Obviously, I can still sign after the deadline so maybe if teams don't get the players they want today then I will hear something\".[19]\n\nOn 20 May 2010, Hamann signed a one-year contract as a player-coach at Milton Keynes Dons[20] but only made 12 appearances as a player. When he left the club on 3 February 2011 to join Leicester City as a First Team Coach,[21] he effectively retired from a playing career.\n\nAfter retiring in February 2011 and managing Stockport County in July 2011, Hamann went back to playing football, and this time for amateur-side TuS Haltern. He signed a contract with the club on 7 March 2015 at the age of 41.[22]\n\nHamann played for Germany at under-21 level before making his full international debut in a friendly against South Africa in November 1997.[23] He was selected by manager Berti Vogts for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, being, at almost 25, the second youngest player in an over-aged Germany squad. During the group stage, Hamann drifted in and out of the starting XI, finally breaking into the team when Germany gained momentum in the second round game against Mexico. However, after a quarter-final defeat against Croatia, Germany was out of the tournament.\n\nDuring the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying, Hamann established himself as a key player for a transitional Germany side. He played in all of Germany's games at the final tournament as they exited in the first round. Hamann was the last player to score at the old Wembley Stadium before its demolition[24] when he scored the winning goal in Germany's 2002 World Cup qualifier against England in October 2000.[25][26]\n\nAlongside Michael Ballack and Bernd Schneider, Hamann was one of the key players in Germany's surprising run to the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final. He became only the second Liverpool player after Roger Hunt in 1966 to play in a World Cup Final while still at the club, but finished on the losing side as Brazil won 2\u20130 in Yokohama. In the 67th minute of that match, Hamann lost the ball to opposing forward Ronaldo, who passed to Rivaldo, who shot from outside the area; goalkeeper Oliver Kahn gave a rebound, allowing Ronaldo to score and give Brazil a 1\u20130 lead. The subsequent Euro 2004 turned out to be Hamann's last tournament. Again, the Euro ended with a disappointing first round exit for Germany. A 1\u20132 defeat against a Czech Republic side resting its key players proved to be Hamann's penultimate international game.\n\nAfter a strong performance in the 2005 Champions League final, Hamann was recalled for the Germany squad by new manager J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann. In the 2\u20132 draw against the Netherlands, Hamann produced a lacklustre performance, apparently convincing Klinsmann that he did not possess the required pace for that kind of level anymore. Hamann was dropped from the squad for the subsequent friendlies. Having not been selected for the German squad in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he decided to officially retire from international football.[27]\n\nOn 20 May 2010, Hamann signed a one-year contract as a player-coach at Milton Keynes Dons.[20] He left the club on 3 February 2011 to join Leicester City as a First Team Coach.[21]\n\nOn 5 July 2011, Hamann was appointed as the new manager of newly relegated Conference Premier club Stockport County, replacing Ray Mathias.[28]  His appointment was made after businessman Tony Evans headed a consortium proposing taking over the club.[29] In his first league game in charge of Stockport, Hamann's side drew 1\u20131 with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn.[30] The match was broadcast live on Premier Sports. Hamann resigned as Stockport County boss on 7 November 2011, citing the failure of the proposed takeover by Tony Evans to materialise; his team were languishing in 17th place having taken only three wins from his nineteen league games in charge.[3][31]\n\nHamann was enlisted by RT\u00c9 Sport for their squad of pundits ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[32][33][34] He returned to RT\u00c9's team during UEFA Euro 2012[35][36] and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[37]\n\nMore recently, in neighbouring Britain, Hamann has guested as a pundit on the BBC's Match of the Day 2. He has also appeared on Sky Sports's football coverage as a pundit, usually when the match involves a club he has played for, most commonly Liverpool, and has also appeared regularly on LFC TV during their live pre-game and post game analysis of Liverpool home games from Anfield.\n\nHe was again part of RT\u00c9 Sport's studio coverage for the finals of UEFA Euro 2016,[38] beginning with an appearance for the opening night match between tournament hosts France and Romania.[39] In assessing Ireland's chances for the tournament, Hamann also said he had been in Dublin to see Ireland beat world champions Germany during the qualifying campaign.[40]\n\nHe was additionally retained by RT\u00c9 Sport as a studio pundit for Champions League and Irish International games for the full football season 2016\u20132017, having been an occasional pundit on Champions League matches during the 2015-16 season.\n\nHe was back on the RT\u00c9 Panel again for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the rescheduled UEFA Euro 2020 in 2021 and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[41][42][43]\n\nHamann also works as a pundit for Sky Sports Bundesliga in Germany.\n\nHamann is also the European columnist for twentyfour7 Football Magazine, where he passes regular comment on the progress and state of the game on the continent.\n\nHe released his autobiography, '\u2032The Didi Man: My love affair with Liverpool\u2032' co-written with Malcolm McClean, in February 2012 and it became a Sunday Times Best Seller.\n\nHamann has two daughters, Chiara and Luna. He is the brother of Matthias Hamann, who also played in the Bundesliga, mainly for Bayern rival TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen. Hamann enjoys cricket and once played for Alderley Edge CC 2nd XI vs Neston CC 2nd XI in the Cheshire County Cricket League,[44] taking a catch in the game. He became interested in the sport during the 2005 Ashes series.[45][46]\n\nOn 23 February 2010, the former German international was found guilty of Driving under the influence and sentenced to a 16-month driving ban while also being fined nearly \u00a32,000. He had been stopped by police at junction six of the M56 near his home in Styal, Cheshire, at 12.15\u00a0am on 12 July 2009.[47][48]\n\nIn cooperation with Standard Chartered Bank, an institution for which he also acted as an ambassador, Hamann hosted a football clinic in Nigeria.[49]\n\nIn 2012, Hamann revealed the gambling problems he suffered towards the end of his career, an addiction that has been \"not healthy or sustainable\" and lasted for many years.[50]\n\nHamann went to Australia on an extended holiday in 2018.[51] In June 2019 he was charged with assault in the country.[51]\n\nBayern Munich\n\nLiverpool\n\nGermany\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietmar_Hamann"}, {"id": 14, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/89/1769734/original/paul-scholes-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Paul Scholes", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/paul-scholes/1769734", "desc": "Paul Scholes ( SKOHLZ; born 16 November 1974) is a co-owner of Salford City, an English football coach and former player.

He is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation and one of the greatest Manchester United players of all time.[3][4][5]\n\nScholes came through the Manchester United youth academy as one of Fergie's Fledglings, a group of players recruited by Manchester United under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson. Scholes made his full debut for Manchester United in the 1994\u201395 season. He went on to make 718 appearances for the club, the third-highest number of appearances by any player for the club. Scholes announced his retirement from playing in May 2011 and was appointed as a coach at Manchester United. He returned to playing in January 2012, and played one more season for the club before retiring again in May 2013.[6][7] With Manchester United, Scholes won 25 trophies including 11 Premier League titles (more than any other English player) and two UEFA Champions League titles.[8][9][10]\n\nScholes represented the England national team from 1997 to 2004, gaining 66 caps and participating in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, as well as the UEFA Euro 2000 and Euro 2004 tournaments. Scholes announced his retirement from international football in August 2004, citing his family life and his club career with Manchester United as being more important.[11]\n\nOver his career Scholes has received praise from various managers and players, including Xavi, who said in 2014 that Scholes was \"the best central midfielder\" he had seen in the previous 15 to 20 years, describing him as \"a spectacular player who has everything. He can play the final pass, he can score, he is strong, he never gets knocked off the ball and he doesn't give possession away.\"[12] Pel\u00e9 said, \"If he was playing with me, I would have scored so many more.\"[13] Thierry Henry cited Scholes as the greatest player in Premier League history.[5] Scholes was named in the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards (1992\u201393 to 2001\u201302) Domestic & Overall Team of the Decade. In 2008, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.[14]\n\nHis first managerial position was at Oldham Athletic, for 31 days in February and March 2019. In 2020, he had a short spell as interim manager of Salford City.\n\nScholes was born in Salford, Greater Manchester. On his mother's side, his grandmother came from Ireland while his grandfather was from Northern Ireland.[15] The family moved to Langley, Greater Manchester, when he was 18 months old, where he lived on Bowness Road and Talkin Drive.[16] He attended the St Mary's RC Primary School in Langley. The first team he played for was Langley Furrow. Scholes also excelled at cricket. At age 14, he began training with Manchester United.[17] He later joined as a trainee upon leaving the Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School in Middleton during the summer of 1991.[16] In his final term at school, he was selected to represent Great Britain National Schools in football.\n\nScholes was a member of the Manchester United youth team that reached the final of the FA Youth Cup in the 1992\u201393 season, alongside Phil Neville.[18] Scholes turned professional on 23 July 1993 and was issued with the number 24 shirt, but did not make his breakthrough into the senior squad until the 1994\u201395 season, when he made seventeen league appearances and scored five goals.[citation needed]\n\nHis debut came on 21 September 1994, where he scored both goals in a 2\u20131 victory over Port Vale in the League Cup. His league debut came three days later against Ipswich Town at Portman Road, a game which United lost 3\u20132 and Scholes scored a consolation goal. He scored two league goals when he came on 10 December when United beat Queens Park Rangers 3\u20132 at Loftus Road. On 3 January 1995, he got onto the scoresheet at Old Trafford for the first time with the opener in a 2\u20130 league win over Coventry City. He scored once more that season, in a 3\u20132 away win over Coventry City on 1 May.[19][failed verification][20]\n\nScholes came on as a substitute in the 1995 FA Cup final against Everton, which United lost 1\u20130. He came close to scoring twice late in the game, only to be foiled by Neville Southall both times.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1995\u201396, after Mark Hughes moved to Chelsea, Scholes had more first-team opportunities, standing in for the suspended Eric Cantona as Andrew Cole's strike partner for the first two months of the campaign. Scholes scored 14 goals in all competitions as United became the first English team to win the double twice.[21] He picked up another Premier League winners medal in 1996\u201397 \u2013 in this season he changed his shirt number to 18, which he held for the next 15 years.\n\nIn the 1996 close season, when United unsuccessfully tried to sign Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers, the Ewood Park club reportedly demanded that United should offer Scholes in exchange if any bid for Shearer from United was to be considered. By this stage, Scholes was rated at \u00a35 million.[citation needed] Shearer, however, never came to Old Trafford, instead joining Newcastle United for \u00a315 million.[22]\n\nAfter Roy Keane suffered a knee injury in late September 1997 and was ruled out for the rest of the season, Scholes was made a central midfielder in the 1997\u201398 season.[citation needed] United finished the season without a major trophy, only the second time in the 1990s that this happened.[23]\n\nIn 1998\u201399, Scholes was a key player in Manchester United's Premier League title, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League treble success. He scored one of Manchester United's two goals against Newcastle in the FA Cup final. He also scored an away goal against Inter Milan in the Champions League quarter-final. He came on as a substitute in the second leg of the semi final against Juventus[24] as Sir Alex Ferguson opted for Nicky Butt in the starting line up. He picked up a yellow card which ruled him out of the final victory over Bayern Munich through suspension.[25]\n\nDuring the 1999\u20132000 season, Scholes scored one of the finest goals of his career against Bradford City on 25 March 2000. David Beckham took a corner directly to Scholes, who was standing on the edge of the area, who volleyed it in over Dwight Yorke, who was forced to duck.[26] A week later, Scholes scored the first hat-trick of his United career against West Ham United in a 7\u20131 victory that put United ten points clear.[27]\n\nDuring the 2001\u201302 transfer window, United completed the signing of Argentine international Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n.[28] In order to accommodate Scholes and Ver\u00f3n, Ferguson persisted with the 4\u20134\u20131\u20131 formation, with Scholes playing at the withdrawn striker role behind Ruud van Nistelrooy, as Roy Keane and Ver\u00f3n played in central midfield (CM).[29] In European away fixtures, Scholes was often played in central midfield alongside Ver\u00f3n as Keane anchored.[30]\n\nScholes netted a career-high 20 goals in all competitions in the 2002\u201303 season, including a hat-trick in a 6\u20132 win against Newcastle.[31] a number that dipped to fourteen the next year. This was despite a career-best four FA Cup goals, in comparison to his total of five FA Cup goals scored in his first nine seasons.\n\nScholes scored the winning goal in the 2003\u201304 FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal,[32] and played in the final which United won 3\u20130 against Millwall,[33] his last FA Cup winners medal. He also played in the 2005 FA Cup Final, but saw his penalty saved by Jens Lehmann as they lost to Arsenal in a penalty shootout.[34]\n\nScholes was ruled out for the second half of the 2005\u201306 campaign with blurred vision.[35] The cause of this was initially uncertain, sparking fears that it could end his career.[36] He overcame this problem through the beginning of the year and he appeared in United's final game of the season against Charlton Athletic.[37]\n\nOn 22 October 2006, in the 2\u20130 victory over Liverpool, Scholes became the ninth United player to play in 500 matches, joining Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes and Ryan Giggs.[38]\n\nScholes experienced one of his finest seasons in 2006\u201307,[39] and was included in the PFA Team of the Year,[40] and was shortlisted for the PFA Players' Player of the Year.[41] One of his finest performances of the season came in a 4\u20131 win against Blackburn Rovers, where United were 1\u20130 down but Scholes \"got hold of the game by the scruff of the neck\" and scored the equalising goal.[42][43] Scholes was dismissed during United's 1\u20130 away victory over Liverpool on 3 March 2007 for swinging an arm at Xabi Alonso.[44] It marked his first league sending off since April 2005.[45] A month later, he was sent off in the first leg of United's Champions League quarter-final at Roma.\n\nScholes suffered knee ligament damage during a training session the night before United's Champions League Group F match with Dynamo Kyiv on 23 October 2007, and was out of action until the end of January 2008.[46] He returned as a substitute in United's 3\u20131 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. On 23 April 2008, Scholes made his 100th Champions League appearance in a 0\u20130 draw away to Barcelona in the semi-final first leg, and scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory in the second leg that sent United into the final.[47] During the final against Chelsea, he suffered an injury and received a yellow card after a clash with Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9; he was substituted in the 87th minute and did not take part in the penalty shoot-out, which United won 6\u20135 after drawing 1\u20131 after extra time.[48] In the 2008 UEFA Super Cup against Zenit Saint Petersburg, Scholes was sent off after he received a second yellow card for a deliberate handball.[49]\n\nScholes was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in September 2008.[50]\n\nOn 22 April 2009, he made his 600th appearance for United in a 2\u20130 win over Portsmouth.[51]\n\nOn 16 February 2010, Scholes scored his third Champions League goal of the season against Milan in a 3\u20132 win; it was also United's first away goal against Milan. This gave United their first away win over Milan and also made Scholes the first player to score against both Inter Milan and Milan at the San Siro in the Champions League.[52] The goal against AC Milan was Scholes' 25th Champions League goal in total, and with 25 goals to his name, Scholes is the highest goal-scoring central midfielder in Champions League history.[53] On 6 March 2010, Scholes became the 19th player in Premier League history to score 100 goals, and also the third United player after Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney to do so, in the 2009\u201310 season, netting the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux Stadium.[54][55] On 16 April 2010, Scholes signed a new one-year contract with United, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2010\u201311 season.[56]\n\nScholes began the 2010\u201311 season strongly, displaying Man of the Match performances against Chelsea in the 2010 Community Shield on 8 August[57] and eight days later in the opening fixture of the new league campaign against Newcastle United as he assisted two goals in a 3\u20130 home victory.[58] Scholes scored his 150th goal for United in a 2\u20132 away draw against Fulham on 22 August;[59] he was also awarded the Premier League Player of the Month for August 2010.[60] In April 2011, Scholes was sent off for a high challenge on Pablo Zabaleta in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City; United went on to lose the fixture 1\u20130.[61]\n\nHe announced his retirement on 31 May 2011, with immediate effect, and joined the coaching staff at Old Trafford.[62]\n\nOn 5 August 2011, United held a testimonial match to honour his 17 years of service to the club. The match was played at Old Trafford against New York Cosmos.[63][64] United won the match 6\u20130, with Scholes opening the scoring with a trademark strike from 25 yards, in front of a sell out 74,731 crowd.\n\nHaving been training with Manchester United's reserve team, Scholes' desire to play football returned and he approached Alex Ferguson and assistant manager Mike Phelan with a view to coming out of retirement, possibly for another club if they declined to have him back at United; however, the club had been going through an injury crisis in midfield, and on 8 January 2012, Scholes made his comeback as a substitute in a 3\u20132 win over neighbours Manchester City in the FA Cup. Since the number 18 shirt had been given to Ashley Young, Scholes wore the number 22 shirt.[65] He made his first start in the next game against Bolton Wanderers, where he scored his first goal since returning in a 3\u20130 victory at Old Trafford, converting a Wayne Rooney pass; this meant he had scored at least one goal in every season in the Premier League since 1994\u201395.[66] He scored his second goal since coming back in a 2\u20131 away win against Norwich City on 26 February, heading home a cross from Nani.[67] On 8 April, he scored in a 2\u20130 win against Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford, helping United to go eight points clear of rivals Manchester City in the Premier League.[68]\n\nOn 30 May, Scholes signed a one-year extension with Manchester United, keeping him at the club until summer 2013.[16][69][70] He marked his 700th appearance for Manchester United by scoring in a 4\u20130 win at home to Wigan Athletic on 15 September 2012.[71] This goal meant that he had scored in his 19th consecutive Premier League season, a feat only surpassed by teammate Ryan Giggs, who holds the record of 21 consecutive seasons.\n\nOn 11 May 2013, Scholes announced that he would make his second and final retirement from football at the end of the season.[72] Scholes made his 499th and final professional league appearance on 19 May 2013 against West Bromwich Albion as a substitute. During the game, Scholes earned his 97th Premier League yellow card, at the time the third most in the history of the Premier League behind Lee Bowyer (102) and Kevin Davies (101).\n\nIn August 2018, Scholes briefly came out of retirement from football at the age of 43 and played a match for his son's team, Royton Town of the Manchester Football League Premier Division, against Stockport Georgians. Royton lost the fixture 1\u20130.[73]\n\nScholes made his international debut against South Africa in 1997 in a 2\u20131 friendly win at Old Trafford, and was included in the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. England were grouped with Colombia, Tunisia and Romania. During England's first World Cup group match against Tunisia, Scholes sealed a 2\u20130 victory with a goal late in the game.\n\nHis international career continued after England's elimination from the World Cup by Argentina on penalties in the first knock-out round. On 27 March 1999, Scholes managed a hat-trick for England in a game against Poland. In addition, Scholes scored both goals in England's 2\u20130 win at Hampden Park over Scotland in the Euro 2000 play-off first leg, sealing a 2\u20131 aggregate win and qualification for the finals tournament. In a qualifier against Sweden that June, Scholes became the first and last England player to be sent off in an international match at the old Wembley Stadium.[17]\n\nWith the turn of the century, Scholes became a prominent player in England's midfield, becoming a first-choice selection for the 2002 World Cup. Immediately prior to Euro 2004, however, Scholes was played out of position on the left midfield to accommodate the pairing of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in central midfield, starting on the left for the last five matches of his international career.[74] Scholes announced his retirement from international football in August 2004, citing his family life and his club career with Manchester United as being more important.[11]\n\nFollowing the departure of England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson in 2006, there was speculation regarding Scholes making himself available for international duty again under new boss Steve McClaren. In October 2006, McClaren said that he had personally asked Scholes twice to rejoin England, but Scholes declined.[75] In May 2010, McClaren's successor Fabio Capello approached Scholes about a return to international football in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, but Scholes again rejected the offer, saying he would prefer to spend time with his family.[76] On 7 June 2010, Scholes stated that if Capello had given him more time and asked earlier, he would have probably taken the opportunity.[77] On 27 July 2010, Scholes expressed his disappointment in not taking the opportunity to play at another World Cup, saying he may have made a mistake.[78]\n\nMy toughest opponent? Scholes of Manchester. He is the complete midfielder. Scholes is undoubtedly the greatest midfielder of his generation... There is no doubt for me that he [Paul Scholes] is still in a class of his own. He's almost untouchable in what he does. I never tire of watching him play. You rarely come across the complete footballer, but Scholes is as close to it as you can get. One of my regrets is that the opportunity to play alongside him never presented itself during my career.[79][80]\n\nZinedine Zidane\n\nScholes was highly regarded for his technical skills, and renowned for his accurate passing, intelligent movement and powerful shooting from long range. Though he played mostly as a striker in his youth and early professional career, Scholes matured into a well-rounded, tenacious, and versatile playmaker capable of playing in any midfield position, often alternating between defensive, offensive, wide and playmaking roles, due to his stamina, vision, work-rate, and positional sense. Scholes was renowned for his late attacking runs and ability to combine with teammates, as well as an excellent capacity to read the game and control the tempo of play, which enabled him to function in a deep-seated creative role as well as in a box-to-box role in the centre of the pitch; he played in the centre for much of the earlier part of his career, while he was instead deployed in a deeper role in the later part of his career. Scholes possessed an extraordinary range of passing and frequently initiated dangerous attacking plays after winning back possession.[81][82]\n\nIn an interview with FourFourTwo, Scholes admitted to not being blessed with notable pace or dribbling skills, and attributed his calmness and ability to retain possession under pressure to having a sharp brain, excellent awareness, and good link-up play.[83][84][85] He was also used in a more advanced creative role on occasion, as a deep-lying forward behind an out-and-out striker.[29] At international level, he was also occasionally used out of position on the left flank.[74]\n\nMany of his peers, including Zinedine Zidane and Edgar Davids, have spoken about their admiration for his talent.[86] Former Brazil international S\u00f3crates was quoted as saying, \"He is good enough to play for Brazil. I love to watch Scholes, to see him pass, the boy with the red hair and the red shirt.\"[87] Former France and Arsenal captain Thierry Henry said, \"Without any doubt the best player in the Premiership has to be Scholes\u00a0... He knows how to do everything.\" When asked about Scholes, Bobby Charlton said, \"Paul is always so in control and pin-point accurate with his passing \u2013 a beautiful player to watch,\"[88] while Italian manager Marcello Lippi remarked that Scholes is \"an all-round midfielder who possesses quality and character in abundance\".[89] In August 2010, BBC football pundit and former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen described Scholes as \"one of the top three to five players to have ever played in the Premier League\", and commented, \"His passing, movement and technique set examples to everyone.\"[90] Former Manchester United teammate Nani commented, \"He's the best midfielder I've ever seen. He can pass, score goals with his left, right, his head \u2013 he can do anything.\"[91] Another one of his former Manchester United teammates, Carlos Tevez, described Scholes as the best passer alongside whom he had ever played.[92]\n\nIn February 2011, Barcelona midfielder Xavi rated Scholes as the best player in his position in the past two decades, stating, \"A role model. For me, and I really mean this, he's the best central midfielder I've seen in the last 15, 20 years. He's spectacular, he has it all, the last pass, goals, he's strong, he doesn't lose the ball, vision. If he'd been Spanish he might have been rated more highly. Players love him.\"[12] This sentiment was echoed by former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who considered Scholes to be the best midfielder of his generation.[93] The former Juventus and A.C. Milan midfielder, Andrea Pirlo, speaking ahead of the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, further elaborated on his admiration for Scholes, \"I have been so fortunate to have played with so many incredible players throughout my career, but if I could pick one that I never got the chance to play with, it would be Paul Scholes. One of the all-time greats. A genius on the field, but private \u2013 no circus around him off it. I have a lot of respect for him.\"[94] Gareth Southgate said, \"You've got very good players and then there are top players. In my time in the England setup, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and [Wayne] Rooney just had that little bit more than all the others. And we are talking high\u2011level people there, players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and David Beckham.\"[95]\n\nMany, including Scholes' national teammates, have said that he was one of the few English players capable of \"pulling the strings\" in midfield, dictating the flow of game where England often have been criticised for being nervous on the ball and giving away possession.[96][97]\n\nScholes received frequent criticism for his discipline, particularly regarding his tackling, which was questioned as frequently inept by multiple pundits, fans and Scholes himself.[98][99] In addition, the potential for malicious intent in some of his tackles has been raised;[100] it has been suggested that he has escaped greater censure due to the admiration that many have for the rest of his game.[101]\n\nScholes has been criticised for his disciplinary record, amassing the fifth-most yellow cards in Premier League history with 97, and also receiving four red cards.[2][102] He has also been booked 32 times in the Champions League, surpassed only by Sergio Ramos.[102][103] Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger criticised Scholes' tackling, stating, \"For me he was not a fair player. There's a little bit of a darker side in him, sometimes, that I did not like. I respect him highly as a quality player but I did not like some things he did on the football pitch.\"[104] Scholes said in a BBC Radio 5 Live interview that he was not a bad tackler, but that, \"If someone got me early in the game, it was always in the back of my mind that I needed to get them back\", and suggested that the bookings he received towards the end of his career were influenced by his reputation.[105]\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Scholes, along with fellow Manchester United legends Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, and Phil Neville, had agreed a deal to purchase Salford City ahead of the 2014\u201315 season.[106][107] with plans to get the club to the Football League.[108] The group announced they would take part in a special friendly, with Salford facing a Class of '92 team.[109][110][111] On 22 September, the group agreed to sell a 50% stake in the club to billionaire Peter Lim.[112][113]\n\nHaving previously informally helped out Nicky Butt with the Manchester United under-19 team during the first half of the 2013\u201314 season, Scholes agreed to join the United first-team coaching staff on a temporary basis after the sacking of David Moyes until the end of the season as a favour to friend and former teammate Ryan Giggs,[114] following the latter's appointment as interim player-manager on 23 April 2014.\n\nIn January 2015, Scholes and Phil Neville were caretaker managers of Salford for a 2\u20131 win over Kendal Town, between the dismissal of Phil Power and appointment of Anthony Johnson and Bernard Morley.[115]\n\nOn 19 November 2017, Scholes and his old teammate, Ryan Giggs, were invited to join in training works for PVF Football Academy in Vietnam. With Ryan Giggs, who was chosen to be a development director, Scholes worked as a technical advisor.\n\nOn 11 February 2019, Scholes was appointed as manager of League Two side Oldham Athletic,[116] having been cleared to take the position by the English Football League in light of his ownership of Salford City.[117] On 14 March, Scholes resigned as manager, having won once in his seven games,[118] following interference from club owner Abdallah Lemsagam in first team affairs.[119]\n\nOn 12 October 2020, Scholes was appointed interim head coach of Salford City, following the departure of Graham Alexander.[120] Scholes' first game in charge was a 1\u20130 defeat to Port Vale on 17 October,[121] and he quickly ruled out taking the position on a permanent basis, citing the need for a more experienced manager.[122] His first win came three days later with a 3\u20130 win against struggling Southend United.[123] Scholes left the role on 4 November 2020, following the permanent appointment of Richie Wellens to the post.[124]\n\nIn July 2014, Scholes became a pundit after signing a four-year deal with BT Sport.[125] He would also be featuring on ITV's coverage of Champions League and England internationals.[126][127] Scholes previously made an appearance for Sky Sports as a pundit during the 2013\u201314 season.[128] In August, he agreed to become a columnist for The Independent.[129] Scholes has been praised for his passionate and no nonsense style of punditry.[130]\n\nScholes featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was on the cover for the international edition of FIFA 2001,[131] and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends for FIFA 17.[132]\n\nScholes has endorsed sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \"Secret Tournament\" commercial (branded \"Scorpion KO\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Lu\u00eds Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\".[133][134]\n\nAlong with other United players who won the 1992 FA Youth Cup, Scholes has proposed a university in Greater Manchester, named University Academy 92 which would offer \"broader courses than traditional degrees\" and attract students who \"otherwise might not go on to higher education\".[135]\n\nScholes is asthmatic,[136] and suffered from Osgood\u2013Schlatter disease (a knee condition that affects young athletes).[137] He married his childhood sweetheart, Claire (n\u00e9e Froggatt),[138] in Wrexham, Wales, in February 1999.[139] They live in the village of Grasscroft in Greater Manchester,[140] and have a daughter and two sons, the younger of whom has autism.[141] He is of Irish and Northern Irish descent.[142]\n\nHis off-field personality is said by some to be in stark contrast to the attitude of the stereotypical professional footballer.[143][144] Roy Keane once highlighted that Scholes did not like the \"celebrity bullshit\" side of professional sports.[145] With regard to his shunning of celebrity, and instead keeping to his intention to solely focus on doing his job (\"a professional footballer\"), Keane applauded Scholes after his retirement.[145]\n\nScholes is known to enjoy betting on football. In June 2019, he was fined and warned over his future conduct by The Football Association (FA) after placing bets worth \u00a326,159 on matches during his time as a director of Salford City. At a tribunal, he was found to have placed 140 bets over three-and-a-half years, in contravention of the FA's gambling rules. The FA fined Scholes \u00a38,000 and asked him to contribute to the costs of the tribunal.[146]\n\nIn an interview given before Euro 2004, Scholes described his ideal day as \"train in the morning, pick up my children from school, play with them, have tea, put them to bed and then watch a bit of TV\".[147] Scholes has always liked a quiet life outside of football.\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[149][150]\n\nEngland score listed first, score column indicates score after each Scholes goal[149]\n\nManchester United\n\nEngland U18\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes"}, {"id": 15, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/89/1768929/original/paul-merson-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Paul Merson", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/paul-merson/1768929", "desc": "Paul Charles Merson (born 20 March 1968) is an English football television pundit and former professional footballer and manager.

While with the Gunners, Merson was a key player in the club's success under Scottish manager George Graham, winning the Football League Championship twice, the FA Cup, the Football League Cup, and the European Cup Winners' Cup. In 1997, he joined Middlesbrough, helping the club gain promotion to the Premier League and finish as runner-up in the 1997\u201398 Football League Cup. After joining Aston Villa in 1998, Merson went on to become club captain and played for the team in the 2000 FA Cup Final, the last to be held at the original Wembley Stadium. In 2002, he signed for second-tier Portsmouth and captained the club to the First Division Championship title and promotion to the Premier League. A year later, he returned to the West Midlands with Walsall, where he went on to serve as player-manager until he was sacked in February 2006.[4] He later had short spells with non-league clubs Tamworth, Welshpool Town, Caerau and Hanworth Villa.\n\nMerson was capped 21 times for the England national football team and represented the nation at 1992 UEFA European Championship and the 1998 FIFA World Cup.[5]\n\nBorn on Wednesday, 20 March 1968 in Harlesden, North West London, Merson started his career at Arsenal, joining the club as an apprentice in 1984. After a loan spell at Brentford, then under manager Frank McLintock, he made his debut for the Gunners on 22 November 1986 against Manchester City, and gradually established himself in George Graham's successful Arsenal side of the late 1980s. By the 1988\u201389 season he was a regular on the right wing, at the end of which Arsenal secured the First Division title with a stoppage time Michael Thomas goal in the final game of the season against Liverpool at Anfield. Merson scored ten times that season, made his debut for the England U21 team, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year.\n\nIn 1991, Merson achieved another league championship with Arsenal and had the highest goalscoring season of his career with 13 goals. He also won a double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1993, scoring in the 1993 Football League Cup Final against Sheffield Wednesday. A year later, he helped Arsenal win its first European trophy in 24 years as the Gunners defeated Parma in Copenhagen to win the 1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup.[6]\n\nMerson's career was put on the line in November 1994 when he admitted to having addictions to alcohol, cocaine and gambling.[7] The Football Association arranged for Merson to undergo a three-month rehabilitation programme and he returned to the side in February 1995, just before the dismissal of George Graham as manager. Under caretaker manager Stewart Houston, Merson helped Arsenal reach the Cup Winners' Cup final for the second season in a row, where Arsenal lost to Real Zaragoza at the Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nIn 1995\u201396, Merson remained a regular first team player under Arsenal's new manager Bruce Rioch and continued to play regularly during the 1996\u201397 season following the appointment of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. In a somewhat surprising move, at the end of the 1996\u201397 Premiership campaign, in which Arsenal finished third, Merson was sold to relegated Middlesbrough in a \u00a34.5million deal \u2013 making him the most expensive player ever signed by a non-Premiership club. Wenger had offered Merson a new two-year contract, but Merson elected to join Boro for a longer contract. Merson played 423 times for Arsenal and scored 99 goals in all competitions.\n\nIn 2008, Merson was ranked the 26th greatest Arsenal player of all-time in a fan poll published by the club's official website.[8]\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Merson left the Gunners to sign for relegated Middlesbrough for a reported fee believed to be \u00a34.5 million. Merson said he was offered a new contract at Arsenal but turned it down for a longer contract and higher wages at Middlesbrough. When telling Arsene Wenger of his decision, Merson claims Wenger told him he would be paid more at Middlesbrough than Dennis Bergkamp was paid at Arsenal.[9] Merson made his league debut for Boro in the opening day victory over Charlton Athletic in a 2\u20131 victory. He played a key role in helping Boro return to the Premier League and was nicknamed by fans as \"The Magic Man\". Merson's form with Boro also won him a place in England's squad for 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Whilst at Middlesbrough he played in the 1998 Football League Cup Final.[10] During the start of the 1998\u201399 season Merson stated he was home sick and wanted a return South. Middlesbrough later agreed to Merson's request and he was sold to Aston Villa for \u00a36.75million.\n\nMerson scored on his Villa debut, converting from his own missed penalty. Merson said in an interview that playing at Villa was the best part of his career.[11] He scored a 'wonder goal' winner versus Everton away from forty five yards out in November 2000. Merson played a key creative role in the Villa side, and helped them to the FA Cup Final in 2000, where they lost 1\u20130 to Chelsea.\n\nMerson signed for Division 1 club Portsmouth on a two-year contract in August 2002,[12] and was instrumental in the club's promotion to the Premiership in 2002\u201303. Merson, however, felt that he was too old for a return to the Premiership, and wanted to move closer to his home in the West Midlands. In July 2003 he signed a two-year deal at Walsall in the First Division, paying compensation to Portsmouth for his remaining year of contract.[13]\n\nIn February 2004, Merson admitted himself to the Sierra Tucson Clinic in Arizona to seek help for his gambling addiction under the advice and financial backing of the PFA, and missed several key games whilst Walsall slipped in the league from mid table mediocrity into the relegation zone. However, a couple of months after his return, Merson was quickly thrown into the manager's spot at Walsall following Colin Lee's sacking for allegedly having talks with Plymouth Argyle over a vacant manager's position there. Merson led a bid to retain Division One status, but was hindered by a last-minute penalty against Crystal Palace, and eventually relegated after a 3\u20132 victory against Rotherham United whilst having to rely on Stoke City beating Gillingham on the final day. The following month, despite relegation, Merson was rewarded with the manager's job on a permanent basis.\n\nThe 2004\u201305 season proved to be a difficult season for Merson, on and off the field. Walsall went out of all cup competitions against lower league teams, and it was reported that Merson had had a rift with his wife, and had started drinking and gambling again, whilst the press reported on him inviting goalkeeper Mark Bosnich back into the game. Walsall slipped close to a second consecutive relegation. Merson responded by making several key signings on transfer deadline day; Julian Joachim, Andy Oakes, Anthony Gerrard (cousin of Steven Gerrard), Craig Pead and David Perpetuini. Merson's side went undefeated during May 2005, securing League One status for another year.\n\nAfter a difficult first season in management, Merson's position at Walsall looked more secure as the club entered the 2005\u201306 season; however, he was unable to lift Walsall out of the relegation zone, and with the club in 19th place, he was sacked on 6 February 2006 after his Walsall side lost 5\u20130 to Brentford at Griffin Park.\n\nDespite a number of offers from clubs as high as the Championship, Merson decided to drop down the leagues and play for part-time Conference club Tamworth, which surprised many but enthralled the Tamworth fans. However, the arrangement meant that until the end of the season, the majority of Merson's wages were to be paid by the club he used to manage, Walsall. Merson played just once, in the 2\u20131 home loss to Halifax Town. He was dropped to the bench for the following game, a 5\u20130 defeat away to Grays Athletic. Merson later announced his retirement from professional football as a player on 9 March 2006, less than a month after joining Tamworth.[14]\n\nOn 28 March 2012, he made a one-off appearance for Mid Wales Football League side Welshpool Town, playing alongside fellow Sky Sports pundit Chris Kamara against Newbridge-on-Wye. Merson scored the opening goal in the 4\u20131 defeat at the Maes y Dre Recreation Ground.[15] On 11 October 2017, Merson signed for Welsh Football League Division Three team Caerau. Following international clearance, he made his debut on 18 October against Pontyclun.[16] In December 2019, Merson joined Hanworth Villa in the Combined Counties League Premier Division,[17] making two appearances for the Villains in total.[18]\n\nMerson first played for the England national team in 1991, being called up by Graham Taylor. He made his debut for the full England side, in a friendly against Germany on 11 September 1991. He participated in the 1992 European Championships in Sweden. He played in the opening 0\u20130 draw with Denmark. England went out after another 0\u20130 draw against the French and a 2\u20131 loss to hosts Sweden.\n\nMerson also played a part in the failed campaign to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He played in the opening game, a 1\u20131 home draw with Norway.[19] He next played against the Netherlands as a substitute for Paul Gascoigne who was injured. England were leading 2\u20131, but crucially conceded a late penalty for a 2\u20132 draw.[20] Merson also played in the 1993 US Cup against Brazil and Germany, nearly scoring in a 2\u20131 defeat to the later, Bodo Illgner saving from a 20-yard shot. He returned for the critical and controversial 2\u20130 defeat against the Dutch in Rotterdam. Merson nearly equalised the opening Dutch goal, and hit the post with an excellent free-kick.[21]\n\nEngland failed to qualify for the World Cup. Taylor's successor, Terry Venables, told Merson that he would not get into the team owing to his life style of heavy drinking.[citation needed] In his book, How Not to be a Professional Footballer, Merson refers to an incident in Chicago while on duty with England during the US Cup. After drinking he wandered off into the city on his own. Merson ended up in a dangerous area and was involved in trying to break up a fight while very drunk himself. When the combatants turned on Merson, he fled back to the hotel. The next morning the FBI came to the hotel and briefed the players on the dangers in the city. They expressed surprise that Merson was not injured in the incident.\n\nMerson held the distinction of being the only player in England's 1998 FIFA World Cup squad not to play for a top flight club. In that tournament, he played in England's famous second round match against Argentina, coming off the bench and scoring in the penalty shoot-out, although England eventually lost. Later he said if England had won their penalty shoot-out he believed England would have won the World Cup.[22]\n\n1998 marked the end of Merson's international career after 21 full caps in seven years, in which he scored three times.[23]\n\nIn August 2006, he commenced a column for the official Arsenal FC magazine. He also continues to play for the England Legends, a 16-man squad of former internationals who have played Italy, Germany, Scotland, Ireland, and the rest of the world. Merson's main job is on Sky Sports, where he is a match reporter and regular pundit for Gillette Soccer Saturday. Merson is often the target of good-humoured jabs from Jeff Stelling and other members of the Soccer Saturday panel; for example, in his attempts to pronounce the names of foreign players. However, Stelling himself, in September 2016, attempted to have Merson agree with him that Ireland international Harry Arter (who had made his debut against England) should get an England call-up in the week Gareth Southgate took over in an emergency capacity following Sam Allardyce's dismissal.[24]\n\nMerson writes a weekly column for the Daily Star's 'Seriously Football' pullout every Saturday and predicts scores for the weeks premier league games called 'Merson Predicts'.[citation needed]\n\nFrom the 2012\u20132015 season Merson co-hosted with John Fendley on the Sky Sports TV programme 'Fantasy Football Club'. From the start of the 2015 season Max Rushden took on co presenting after John Fendley returned to Soccer AM as a co-host. Fantasy Football Club is aired weekly on Friday evenings at 6pm. Both co-hosts also co-managed a fantasy team in the Sky Fantasy 'Celebrities' League.[citation needed]\n\nBorn in Harlesden, North West London,[25] Merson has been married three times (to Lorraine, Louise and now Kate), and has eight children, including one set of twin girls.\n\nHis first marriage crumbled under his recovery from drug addiction and alcoholism.[26]\n\nIn October 2011, Merson was involved in a car crash with a lorry on the M40 motorway near Warwick and arrested for drink-driving.[27]\n\nWhile appearing on Harry's Heroes: The Full English, a 2019 ITV documentary, Merson opened up about how substance abuse and gambling have affected his life, and his continued struggles with addictions. He received praise for his candid discussion of the topic.[28] In the second series Merson confided in former Arsenal team mate, goalkeeper David Seaman, that he voluntarily attends Alcoholics Anonymous, including English speaking meetings in Paris, during breaks in filming for ITV's Harry's Heroes: Euro...Having a Laugh, football tour S2.Ep1.[29]\n\nMerson participated in the Mental Health Awareness Week.[30] In January 2020, Merson spoke about how his drink, drug and gambling habits fuelled his struggles with mental health.[31][32]\n\nArsenal[33]\n\nAston Villa[33]\n\nPortsmouth[33]\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Merson"}, {"id": 16, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/84/1676997/original/nicolas-anelka-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Nicolas Anelka", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/nicolas-anelka/1676997", "desc": "Nicolas S\u00e9bastien Anelka (French pronunciation: \u200b[nik\u0254la an\u025blka]; born 14 March 1979) is a French football manager and former player who played as a forward.

As a player, he regularly featured in his country's national team, often scoring at crucial moments. Known for his ability to both score and assist goals, he has been described as a classy and quick player, with good aerial ability, technique, shooting, and movement off the ball, and was capable of playing both as a main striker and as a second striker.[6][7]\n\nAnelka began his career at Paris Saint-Germain, but soon moved to Arsenal. He became a first team regular and won the PFA Young Player of the Year Award the following season. He moved to Real Madrid for \u00a322.3\u00a0million in 1999, but did not settle in well and returned to PSG in a \u00a320\u00a0million deal. Despite regular first team football in Paris, Anelka set his eyes upon the Premier League once more, moving on loan to Liverpool in January 2002, but joining Manchester City for \u00a313\u00a0million at the start of the 2002\u201303 season.\n\nAfter three seasons in Manchester, he moved to Turkish club Fenerbah\u00e7e for two seasons, before returning to England to join Bolton Wanderers in deals worth \u00a37\u00a0million and \u00a38\u00a0million respectively. He was then transferred to Chelsea from Bolton for a reported \u00a315\u00a0million in January 2008. In 2009, he won the Premier League Golden Boot award as the league's top goalscorer. During his transfers over the years, he has built an aggregate transfer cost of just under \u00a390\u00a0million.[8] On 12 December 2011, Shanghai Shenhua announced that they had reached an agreement with Anelka to join the team in the winter transfer window.[9] After one season there, Anelka joined Italian side Juventus on a six-month loan deal in 2013, after which he was released from Shanghai and signed for West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer. Following his dismissal by West Brom, he signed for Mumbai City FC as a marquee player and was named player-manager in 2015.\n\nAnelka played 69 times at international level and won his first international honours with France at UEFA Euro 2000, and won the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup the following year. His failure to settle at club level limited his international appearances, but he returned to the national team for Euro 2008. On 19 June 2010, he was excluded by the French Football Federation (FFF) from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa for \"comments directed against the national coach, Raymond Domenech, unacceptable to the FFF, French football, and the principles they uphold\".[10] Two months later, having failed to turn up to his disciplinary hearing, he was banned for France's next 18 matches by the FFF, effectively ending his international career.[11] Anelka later claimed to be \"dying with laughter\" at the 18-match ban, as he had already decided to retire from international play.[12]\n\nAnelka was born in Le Chesnay, Yvelines,[13] to parents who had moved  from Martinique in 1974. Thereafter, they settled in Trappes, near Paris. His childhood friends from Trappes include the actors Omar Sy and Jamel Debbouze.[14] His mother is a secretary in the local high school.[15][16][17]\n\nAnelka is married to Barbara Tausia, a Belgian choreographer. Together, they have two sons, Kais, born in 2008, and Kahil, born in 2010.[18] He acted in the 2002 film Le Boulet as a footballer named Nicolas. He has said that when he retires from football, he would like to work in the film industry because he has a friend in the business.[19] He said, \"I have a friend who's a producer, who makes lots of films. He recently did Ast\u00e9rix. So it's already agreed that I'm going to do other films. It helps to know actors and producers. It's different to football and it's something I enjoy very much because there's no ball. I like pretending to be somebody else, it's fun.\"[citation needed]\n\nAnelka has two brothers, Claude and Didier.[20]\n\nAfter discussing religion with some childhood friends, Anelka converted to Islam in 2004 in the United Arab Emirates, taking the Muslim name of \"Abdul-Salam Bilal\".[21] Anelka has said that he initially fasted during daylight hours as is required for the Muslim month of Ramadan, but \"I realised I often got injured just after the period of Ramadan, so I don't observe it strictly any more\".[22] Initially, Anelka considered leaving European football to play in the UAE: \"I am ready to stay here and to play for a club in the Emirates. I am not keen to go back to England or France.\" However, this did not come to pass and he briefly moved to Turkey instead, as well as three more English clubs.[23]\n\nAnelka is also known for his controversial relationship with French comedian Dieudonn\u00e9 M'bala M'bala and attracted widespread condemnation after performing the quenelle hand gesture, created by M'bala and regarded as anti-Semitic, on the pitch when playing for West Bromwich Albion in 2013.[24] Anelka responded that the gesture was anti-establishment, not anti-Semitic.[24] An FA disciplinary hearing nonetheless banned Anelka for five matches, but found that he was not anti-Semitic and had not intended the gesture to express or promote anti-Semitism.[25] After West Brom suspended him pending their own investigation, Anelka was given notice of termination of his contract by the club due to the club and player being unable to come to terms over the conditions required for the suspension by the club to be lifted, as well as comments made by Anelka on Twitter.[26] In 2020, Anelka said the quenelle was only a protest against his former manager Steve Clarke, who is not Jewish.[27]\n\nAnelka has been the subject of the 2012 Canal+ documentary L'Entr\u00e9e des Trappistes about his friendship with Sy and Debbouze,[14] and the feature-length 2020 Netflix documentary Anelka: Misunderstood.[27]\n\nAnelka began his career at Paris Saint-Germain as a youth player at age 16.[28]\n\nIn February 1997, at age 17, Anelka joined Premier League club Arsenal for a \u00a3500,000 transfer fee[29] under newly appointed manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. The transfer caused controversy in France as Arsenal sought to sign him for free under the precedent of the recent Bosman ruling, despite there being exceptions for players under the age of 24; Wenger said this age restriction was only for domestic transfers.[30]\n\nHis first team opportunities were limited in the 1996\u201397 season, but in 1997\u201398, he broke into the first team after a long-term injury to striker Ian Wright. In November 1997, Anelka scored his first goal for Arsenal in a 3\u20132 home win against Manchester United.[31][32] Anelka was a key player in Arsenal's Double win of both the Premier League and FA Cup that season.[33] Anelka scored the second goal in Arsenal's 2\u20130 win over Newcastle United in that season's FA Cup final.[34]\n\nAnelka was Arsenal's top scorer in the 1998\u201399 season with 17 Premier League goals. This form saw him voted the PFA Young Player of the Year, but Arsenal failed to defend their Premier League and FA Cup titles and made little progress in the UEFA Champions League. Fans turned on the striker amid transfer speculation and a perceived lack of enthusiasm, giving him the nickname \"Le Sulk\".[35] During the close season, Anelka stated a desire to leave Arsenal, claiming the British press was responsible for his unhappiness in England.[36] On 2 August 1999, he joined Real Madrid.[37]\n\nWith regard to his time with the Gunners, Anelka later said he believes he should have never left Arsenal, a club that he has great \"love\" for.[38][39] Of his former boss at Highbury, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Anelka is a huge admirer and a strong supporter of him.[40] Anelka also placed at 29th in the club's compilation of the 50 Greatest Gunners of all-time. In all, he made 90 appearances for Arsenal, scoring 28 goals altogether for the club.[39][38]\n\nIn the summer of 1999, Anelka moved to Real Madrid for a \u00a322.3\u00a0million transfer fee.[41] He took time to score for the club; on a visit to the football tabloid Marca he played a FIFA game with the staff, who then released the mocking front-page headline \"Anelka finally scores a goal...on a video game\".[42] He failed to score for Real Madrid in his first five months at the club, eventually recording his first goal in the opening match of the FIFA Club World Championship against Al-Nassr on 5 January 2000.[43] Two days later, he scored twice against Corinthians in the same competition, also missing an 81st-minute penalty kick that would have given him a hat-trick.[44]\n\nOn 28 February 2000, Anelka scored his first La Liga goal in a 3\u20130 defeat of rivals Barcelona in El Cl\u00e1sico at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium.[45] However, in March, he was suspended by club president Lorenzo Sanz after refusing to train, because of a disagreement with head coach Vicente del Bosque.[46] After returning to the team,[47] Anelka scored in both legs of the Champions League semi-final to give Los Blancos a 3\u20132 aggregate victory over Bayern Munich and advance to the competition final.[48][49][50][51] He started in the final, held at the Stade de France in his home city of Paris, as Real Madrid ran out 3\u20130 winners over Valencia to win an eighth European Cup.[52]\n\nAnelka signed a six-year professional contract at Paris Saint-Germain in July 2000, a return to the club at which he used to play as a youth player, in a transfer deal worth \u00a322\u00a0million.[53] The Paris club had finished second in Ligue 1 that season, thereby qualifying for the 2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League. Anelka's return was met with much fanfare. Canal Plus, which owned Paris Saint-Germain, financed the transfer, while PSG sponsor Nike covered much of Anelka's compensation of \u00a330\u201335,000 per week.[54]\n\nAnelka started well and was appointed captain of a team that was briefly at the top of 2000\u201301 French Division 1, but the team's form quickly dropped.[55] In December 2000, following a 5\u20131 loss to Sedan, Philippe Bergeroo was replaced as PSG manager by Luis Fern\u00e1ndez. PSG finished ninth in Ligue 1 that season, earning a place in next season's UEFA Intertoto Cup. PSG finished second in the first round of group stage, behind Bayern Munich, but finished bottom of the second group stage, behind Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, Galatasaray and Milan.[56]\n\nHowever, once again, Anelka developed issues with his head coach, Luis Fern\u00e1ndez (who was already under pressure for benching Ronaldinho due to his work ethic).[citation needed]\n\nAfter two-and-a-half years, Anelka returned to the Premier League in December 2001 to join Liverpool on a short-term loan deal until the end of the season. He contributed to Liverpool's late push to come second in the 2001\u201302 FA Premier League, scoring goals against Everton,[57]\nFulham,[58] Blackburn Rovers,[59] Ipswich Town,[60] and in the 2001\u201302 FA Cup against Birmingham City,[61] but manager G\u00e9rard Houllier opted not to offer him a permanent deal after the end of the season in favour of signing Senegalese forward El Hadji Diouf.[62]\n\nAnelka joined Manchester City on 24 May 2002, with the \u00a313\u00a0million transfer fee paid by manager Kevin Keegan, then a club record high.[63] In his first season at City, Anelka was the club's top scorer with 14 goals, including a goal in the last ever Manchester Derby at Maine Road against Manchester United, against former club Arsenal and a last minute winner at Anfield after scoring a penalty just moments earlier. In his second season at City, he finished top scorer again, in the club's first season at the City of Manchester Stadium, with 25 goals. On 16 October 2004, he won and scored a penalty against Chelsea, which led to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's first defeat as Chelsea manager.[64]\n\nIn January 2005, Manchester City announced Anelka had completed a \u00a37\u00a0million transfer to Turkish team Fenerbah\u00e7e.[65] He helped the Turkish club win the S\u00fcper Lig title in 2005,[66] and played with them in the UEFA Cup that season, as well as the UEFA Champions League the season after.[67]\n\nOn 25 August 2006, Bolton Wanderers signed Anelka on a four-year deal for a club record transfer fee of \u00a38\u00a0million.[68] He made his debut for Bolton against Watford on 9 September 2006.[69] He opened his account on 19 September in a League Cup match against Walsall, scoring the last goal of a 3\u20131 away win.[70] After 11 matches without a goal in the Premier League, he scored his first goals \u2013 a brace \u2013 on 25 November to help down Arsenal 3\u20131.[71] He finished the 2006\u201307 Premier League season as Bolton's top scorer with eleven goals.[72]\n\nIn January 2007, Anelka stated he would be willing to leave Bolton for a return to former club Arsenal.[73] However, he pledged his future to Bolton in July 2007 following talks with manager Sammy Lee.[74] Anelka later said he would reluctantly consider leaving the club if Bolton's poor start to the 2007\u201308 season continued,[75] but later signed a new four-year contract lasting until 2011 on 30 August.[76] In June 2020 Anelka admitted he signed the contract so that Bolton could get a bigger transfer fee when he left.[77]\n\nOn 11 January 2008, it was confirmed Anelka would join Chelsea for \u00a315\u00a0million.[78] He made his Chelsea debut against Tottenham Hotspur on 12 January 2008,[79] and scored his first goal two weeks later in the FA Cup against Wigan Athletic. He scored his first league goal on 2 February against Portsmouth, but failed to score again for Chelsea during the 2007\u201308 season.[80]\n\nIn the 2008 Champions League final, Anelka delivered Chelsea's seventh penalty which was saved by Edwin van der Sar, resulting in Manchester United winning the competition. Anelka later blamed manager Avram Grant for his penalty miss, claiming Grant brought him on to play as a late substitute without a proper warm up beforehand and also too late in the game to acclimatize himself in it.[81]\n\nOn 3 August 2008, Anelka scored four goals in a 5\u20130 friendly win against Milan.[82]\n\nWith Didier Drogba injured at the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season, Anelka made a very impressive start to the campaign. His goalscoring spree won him the Golden Boot Award on 14 November 2008 for being the first player that season to score ten Premier League goals.[83] Anelka scored his first competitive hat-trick for Chelsea against Sunderland, in a 5\u20130 home win on 1 November 2008, and followed this up with two braces against Blackburn Rovers, then West Bromwich Albion.[84] He established himself as an important member of the squad and maintained his place in the team despite the return to fitness of Drogba. After the arrival of Guus Hiddink, Anelka was more often played on the wing. Furthermore, he was ranked among the top goalscorers in the league for the season. He scored another hat-trick against Watford in the FA Cup to earn Chelsea a 3\u20131 victory at Vicarage Road.[85] On 10 May, he scored one goal and set up another in a 4\u20131 away win against former club Arsenal. Anelka did not celebrate the goal which he scored in the game, as he disclosed \"he still loved Arsenal\".[86] A goal in Chelsea's final Premier League game of the season at Sunderland put him as top goal scorer for the season in the Premier League, earning him the Golden Boot with 19 goals.[87]\n\nAnelka scored his first goal of the 2009\u201310 season against West London rivals Fulham in a 2\u20130 win at Craven Cottage, before continuing his fine form with the opening goal in Chelsea's 3\u20130 win over Burnley the following weekend. He scored his third goal of the season in the opening match of the 2009\u201310 Champions League group stage in the 1\u20130 victory over Porto.[88] Anelka scored one of the best goals of his season against APOEL in the Champions League with the ball being passed into the net from outside the box. Anelka scored his third league goal of the season against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in a 2\u20130 win with the second goal coming from compatriot Florent Malouda.[89] Anelka continued his fine scoring run in the Champions League with the winner in the 1\u20130 victory over Porto at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o, making Chelsea only the second ever English side to win at Porto's home ground. He continued his scoring in the season by scoring Chelsea's first goal in a 3\u20133 draw against Everton in the Premier League, his first goal in the competition since October.[90] He followed that up with another goal in Chelsea's 2\u20131 victory over Portsmouth.[91]\n\nOn 16 January 2010, on his return from injury, Anelka scored twice in an astonishing 7\u20132 victory over Sunderland.[92] He continued this fine form into the next match scoring in an FA Cup tie against Preston North End, bringing his tally in the previous four matches to five goals. After the return of Didier Drogba from the African Cup of Nations, Anelka had been playing on the wing to support him. Anelka scored his first goal since January in a 1\u20130 win over his former club Bolton in April 2010, putting Chelsea four points ahead of second-place Manchester United.[93] On the final day of the season, Anelka scored two goals against Wigan Athletic, including the first Chelsea goal in the sixth minute,[94] to help Chelsea win their third Premier League title and their first in four years.[95] Anelka (along with Ashley Cole) joined Henning Berg in the exclusive band of players who have won the Premier League title with two different clubs.[96] On 24 June 2010, Chelsea announced Anelka had signed a new one-year extension to his existing contract that will keep him at the club until 2012.[97]\n\nAnelka started the 2010\u201311 campaign in fine form for Chelsea. He assisted Florent Malouda's last goal against West Brom on the opening day of the Premier League season, scored a double in the next game against Wigan Athletic, then won a penalty against Stoke City in Chelsea's third game of the season. He continued this fine form in Chelsea's first Champions League match, scoring a first half brace against M\u0160K \u017dilina. Further goals against Marseille and Spartak Moscow ensured this was the first season since playing for Paris Saint-Germain he had scored at least four goals in a Champions League season. On 19 October, during Chelsea's Champions League group stage match against Spartak, Anelka continued his impressive goal scoring form in the Champions League, scoring the second goal of the match and his 50th goal for Chelsea in the 43rd minute of the game. He ended the 2010\u201311 season with 16 goals from 45 appearances in all competitions.\n\nAnelka scored Chelsea's first goal of the 2011\u201312 season against West Brom in a 2\u20131 Premier League victory. This would prove to be Anelka's final goal for Chelsea, however, as he failed to find the net in 14 further appearances in 2011. On 3 December 2011, after Chelsea's 3\u20130 victory against Newcastle United, manager Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas confirmed to the media that Anelka, along with centre-back Alex, had submitted transfer requests to the club and would be free to leave Chelsea in January.[98] On 12 December, Chelsea confirmed Anelka would join Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua. Zhu Jun, owner of Shanghai Shenhua, confirmed his club had sealed a deal with Anelka in his Weibo on 12 December 2011.[99] This deal was later officially announced by both clubs and was finalized the same day.[100][101]\n\nIn total, Anelka scored 59 goals for Chelsea in 184 appearances.[102]\n\nOn 1 January 2012, Anelka moved to Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua, with his annual salary reported to be around \u20ac12\u00a0million.[103] Following his move, Anelka revealed he turned down the chance to join his former club PSG the previous month in favour of signing for Shanghai Shenhua, and explained that his move was because he did not have attractive offers to remain within Europe.[104] On 21 February 2012, he scored his debut goal in a pre-season friendly match against Hunan Billows, just 40 seconds after the start of the match. Anelka failed to make his Chinese Super League (CSL) debut due to ankle injury on the opening league match of the season against Jiangsu Sainty.[105] He eventually made his CSL debut and scored his first CSL goal on 16 March 2012, in a 3\u20132 away defeat against bitter rivals Beijing Guoan.[106] On 11 April 2012, Anelka was named as part of the coaching staff to help struggling manager Jean Tigana.[107]\n\nOn 19 June 2012, it was confirmed that Anelka's former Chelsea teammate Didier Drogba would join Shanghai Shenhua.[108] On 7 June 2012, it was claimed Anelka was keen on a move back to the Premier League after he was involved in a heated exchange with a fan for refusing to bow in front of the travelling Shenhua fans with his teammates.[109] Anelka provided two assists for Drogba and headed in a late equaliser to earn Shenhua a point in a 3\u20133 draw with Shandong Luneng Taishan on 25 August.[110][111]\n\nOn 26 January 2013, Anelka joined Italian side Juventus on a five-month loan deal.[112] He made his debut for Juventus against Celtic in the Champions League.[113] Anelka made two further appearances for Juventus, both in Serie A, as the club won the league title.[114]\n\nOn 4 July 2013, Anelka joined West Bromwich Albion on a free transfer after being released by Shanghai Shenhua, marking another return to the Premier League, the sixth Premier League club he has played for in his career.[115] He said he would like to end his career in England, at West Brom.[116] On 22 August 2013, Anelka reportedly walked out of a training session telling staff he was leaving the club to retire. The reports were quickly denied by the club, which confirmed Anelka would miss one match and that he had left the session early on compassionate grounds following the death of his agent.[117] On 28 August 2013, it was announced that since completing his week of compassionate leave, Anelka had decided to remain with the club and would begin training the following day in preparation for West Brom's forthcoming match against Swansea City.[118] He subsequently returned full-time to the team.[citation needed]\n\nAnelka scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20133 draw with West Ham United on 28 December 2013, scoring a first-half brace in his first appearance in over two months. During his goal celebration he performed a quenelle, a hand gesture popularized by his comedian friend Dieudonn\u00e9, described by some critics as an inverted Nazi salute.[24] The Football Association (FA) and anti-racism organisations investigated the incident following allegations of anti-Semitism.[24] On 27 February 2014, an FA disciplinary hearing banned Anelka for five matches, fined him \u00a380,000 and ordered him to complete an educational course. In the hearing, the FA disciplinary hearing panel concluded, \"[W]e did not find that Nicolas Anelka is an anti-Semite or that he intended to express or promote anti-Semitism by his use of the quenelle.\"[25] Anelka and the FA both decided not to appeal this verdict.[119] In the 2020 documentary Anelka: Misunderstood, Anelka said that the quenelle was only a protest at former West Brom manager Steve Clarke, who is not Jewish.[27]\n\nAnelka used social media to announce he was terminating his contract with West Brom.[120] West Brom responded that Anelka had given the club no official notification of his intention to leave, and later gave him 14 days notice of termination from the club for gross misconduct.[121][122]\n\nOn 15 September 2014, Anelka joined Mumbai City of the newly formed Indian Super League.[123][124] Following a three-match global ban, he made his debut on 28 October 2014 in a 5\u20131 defeat at Chennaiyin FC.[125] Five days later, in his first home match at the DY Patil Stadium, Anelka scored the match's only goal to defeat Kerala Blasters.[126] On 5 November, he scored his only other goal of the season, for a home game of the same outcome against the Delhi Dynamos.[127] Anelka played a total of seven matches for Mumbai, as they finished seventh and did not qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.[128]\n\nIn January 2015, Anelka had agreed a deal to join Algerian side NA Hussein Dey on an 18-month contract. However, the move was blocked by the Algerian Football Federation as, \"Only those aged under 27 and playing on the international level for their countries are allowed to sign up with our clubs.\"[129] Anelka subsequently returned to Mumbai and was named the team's player-manager on 3 July 2015.[130]\n\nAt youth level, Anelka played for the French under-20 team at the 1997 World Youth Championship, and made his senior team debut for France in a goalless draw with Sweden national team on 22 April 1998. Anelka was not selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup-winning squad, but quickly became France's first choice centre forward during the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying campaign, scoring the opening goal in France's 3\u20132 win over Russia on his first international start[131] and scoring both goals in a comfortable 2\u20130 win over England at Wembley Stadium in February 1999.[132] Anelka made his first appearance in a major tournament at Euro 2000, which France went on to win. He also formed part of the squad which won the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he scored his only tournament goal in a 5\u20130 win over hosts South Korea in the opening game.[133] In November 2002, he rejected an emergency call-up by Jacques Santini to face Serbia and Montenegro and was barred by the manager; in February 2004 he eyed a return for the UEFA Euro 2004 squad as Djibril Ciss\u00e9 was suspended.[134][135]\n\nIn November 2005, now under, Raymond Domenech, Anelka returned to the France squad for a friendly against Costa Rica in Martinique. The match in the homeland of Anelka's parents was the team's first in the French Caribbean.[136] He scored in the 3\u20132 win.[137] When Ciss\u00e9 was forced out of 2006 World Cup due to injury, Lyon striker Sidney Govou was called up as Ciss\u00e9's replacement rather than Anelka.[138]\n\nAnelka came on as a substitute in the Euro 2008 qualifier against Lithuania on 24 March 2007, and scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory. Following his performance, Anelka was praised by France manager Raymond Domenech: \"It is the Nicolas I like to see... when he shows these qualities, he is a candidate for a permanent place.\"[139] He also scored in the 2\u20130 victory against Ukraine on 2 June 2007.[140]\n\nAnelka featured in the France squad for Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland.[141] Anelka started France's first group game against Romania, but was substituted after 72 minutes.[142] He did not start either of France's remaining two games in the tournament against the Netherlands and Italy, coming on as a substitute in both games.[143][144]\n\nAnelka played a key role in France's 2010 World Cup playoff against the Republic of Ireland. He scored the winning goal in the 72nd minute that put France in a good position with one away goal.[145]\n\nDuring the 2010 World Cup, Anelka was sent home after reportedly abusing coach Raymond Domenech at half-time during the 2\u20130 defeat to Mexico.[146] Following criticism of his positioning by Domenech, Anelka is reported to have said, \"Va te faire enculer, sale fils de pute,\"[147] meaning, \"Go fuck yourself, you dirty son of a whore.\"[148] The incident was later reported by the media, and the player refused to publicly apologise when asked to do so by French Football Federation (FFF) president Jean-Pierre Escalettes.[149] The next day, the squad refused to go to training in protest against Anelka's expulsion.[150] Anelka was subsequently given an 18-game suspension from international football by the FFF as punishment for his actions, effectively ending his international career. Anelka later claimed to be \"dying with laughter\" at the 18-match ban, as he had already decided to retire from international play.[151]\n\nAnelka took L'\u00c9quipe to court for their front page, demanding \u20ac150,000 in compensation. He lost the case as he only denied the wording of the insult that was attributed to him, and not the fact that he made an insult.[152] In a 2018 documentary, Domenech said that Anelka only insulted his management, not him as a person or his mother.[153]\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Anelka joined the technical staff of Dutch Eredivisie side Roda JC in February 2017, claiming he wanted to help his friend and the club's shareholder Aleksey Korotaev.[154] In November 2018, he joined Lille as a youth forwards coach.[155] On 3 February 2021 he became the sports director of Hy\u00e8res FC, under the new ownership of Mourad Boudjellal.[156] He departed three months later, on 4 May 2021, with no first team game taking place during his tenure due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France.[157]\n\nArsenal\n\nReal Madrid\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nFenerbah\u00e7e\n\nChelsea\n\nJuventus\n\nFrance U18\n\nFrance\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Anelka"}, {"id": 17, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/64/1271428/original/jason-bell-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Jason Bell", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/jason-bell/1271428", "desc": "Jason Dewande Bell (born April 1, 1978) is a former professional American football cornerback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans and New York Giants.

Both of his parents were farmers in Sikkim and were originally not keen on Bhutia's interest in sports. His father died in his childhood but after encouragement from his uncle, Karma Bhutia, he started his education in St.\u00a0Xaviers School, Pakyong, East Sikkim. At the age of nine he won a football scholarship from SAI to attend the Tashi Namgyal Academy in Gangtok.[18]\n\nHe went on to play for several schools and local clubs in his home state of Sikkim, including the Gangtok-based Boys Club, which was managed by Karma.[19] His performance at the 1992 Subroto Cup, where he won the \"Best Player\" award, brought him to the notice of the football establishment. Former India goalkeeper, Bhaskar Ganguly spotted his talent and helped him make the transition to Calcutta football.[20] In addition to football, Bhutia also represented his school at badminton, basketball and athletics.[19]\n\nIn 1993, at the age of sixteen, Bhutia left school to join the professional East Bengal F.C. in Kolkata.[21] Two years later, he transferred to JCT Mills in Phagwara, which went on to win the India National Football League in the 1996\u201397 season.[19][22] Bhutia was the top goalscorer in the league, and was chosen to make his international debut in the Nehru Cup.[18] He was named \"1996 Indian Player of the Year\".[18][20]\n\nIn 1997, Bhutia returned to East Bengal.[19] He has the distinction of scoring the first hat-trick in the local derby between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, when he registered one in East Bengal's 4\u20131 victory in the 1997 Federation Cup semi-final.[23] He became team captain in the 1998\u201399 season, during which East Bengal finished second behind Salgaocar in the league.[24] Furthermore, he became the 19th footballer to receive the Arjuna Award in 1999, which the Government of India gives out to athletes to recognise their \"outstanding achievements\" in national sports.[18][20]\n\n\"His presence will be a big boost to the confidence of many Asian youngsters.\"\n\nPiara Power, Let's Kick Racism Out of Football campaign co-ordinator, after Bhutia signed for Bury.[25] \n\nBhutia has had limited opportunities in playing overseas.

In his final season there he was awarded the \"Player of the National Football League\" by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in a season where he scored 12 goals.[43] Despite this, East Bengal finished runners-up to Mahindra United in the league.[44]\n\nIn 2005, Bhutia signed for another Malaysian club, Selangor MK Land.[45] He made five appearances only, scoring one goal, as the club had monetary problems. Before, he received an offer from then Home United manager Steve Darby, but rejected the offer. Darby later revealed that he failed to sign Bhutia because the offer he made was less than what he was getting in India that time.[46]\n\n\"I will try to live up to the expectations of Mohun Bagan supporters and bring success to the team this time.\"\n\nBhaichung Bhutia, on signing for Mohun Bagan a second time.[47] \n\nOn 15 June 2006, he joined Mohun Bagan and formed an attacking partnership with Jose Ramirez Barreto. However, the 2006\u201307 season was a poor one for Bhutia and Mohun Bagan as they finished eighth in the league, just one position above relegation.[48] During the 2007\u201308 season (the league was now known as the I-League), Bhutia scored 10 goals in 18 matches, and Mohun Bagan finished slightly higher in the league in fourth place.[49] Bhutia won the Indian Player of the Year for the second time in 2008. In winning the award, he became only the second footballer to win it more than once; the other was I. M. Vijayan.[50] In the 2008\u201309 season, despite a 10-match winning streak, Mohun Bagan finished in second place behind Churchill Brothers because of a final day loss to Mahindra United.[51] Bhutia finished the season with six goals.[52]\n\nOn 18 May 2009, Bhutia announced he would quit Mohun Bagan, due to the questioning of his footballing commitment by the club's officials.[53] As a result of the Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa incident, he was suspended for six months by Mohun Bagan.[54] Bhutia was quoted saying \"It is just a ploy to keep me at Mohun Bagan for another season. But I will not play for them any more.\"\n\n\"I want to tell the millions of East Bengal supporters that I am going to finish my career here. It is not going to be a matter of [a] few months but for the rest of my life.\"\n\nBhaichung Bhutia, on signing for East Bengal a fourth time.[55] \n\nBhutia was reported to have officially signed for East Bengal on 22 June 2009, on a one-year contract, announcing that he would end his playing career at the club.[56] Upon signing for East Bengal, Bhutia declared it to be his homecoming, \"This is really my homecoming. This is the club from where it all started and it is here where it is going to end.\"[55] The situation was further complicated, however, as Mohun Bagan's general secretary Anjan Mitra said \"Our contract with Bhaichung is perfectly legal and he has one more year left with us.\"[57] Bhutia's lawyer Usha Nath Banerjee countered this, \"I doubt the legality of Bagan's contract. In any case, according to FIFA and AIFF rules, a player who is above 28 years of age is free to make a choice of club in the third year of his contract\".[57] Bhutia and Mohun Bagan were set to meet on 17 August in the AIFF headquarters to settle their differences with AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco.[57] On 29 August, it was announced that the issue had not been resolved yet and the outbound Colaco was set to meet Bhutia on 30 August.[58] No compromise was reached, however, and on 5 September former additional solicitor general Amrendra Sharan was appointed to look into the dispute.[59] On 10 September, Bhutia filed defamation charges, claiming damages of \u20b910\u00a0million, against Mohun Bagan for \"trying to tarnish his reputation\".[60] Bhutia was granted interim relief on 26 September, but the case between Mohun Bagan and Bhutia is set to continue until a final verdict is reached.[61] On 4 November, it was revealed that Mohun Bagan had approached football's governing body FIFA to intervene in the dispute with Bhutia.[62]\n\nThe start of the 2010\u201311 season would be without Bhutia until the end of January as the India national team prepared and participated in the Asian Cup from November to January. Though laid low by injuries in recent months, Bhutia believes he would return next season after taking a three-month break and if he ever decides to quit, he would do it from East Bengal.[63]\n\nIn 2011, Bhutia joined United Sikkim as coach and Manager.\n\nOn 12 February 2015, it was announced that Bhutia would return to East Bengal for the final time on a half-season contract, after which he would retire from professional football. Having retired from India colours in 2011 against South Korea in the AFC Asian Cup, Bhutia last season said he wished to retire donning red and gold colours \"one last time\".\n\n\"But I don't see that happening. I am really struggling with my knee injury and not in a shape to play the top-tier I-League for East Bengal. You can say that I am not going to play club again,\" Bhutia told reporters at the launch of East Bengal's residential academy in BA-CA ground in Salt Lake.[64][65]\n\nBhaichung made his senior international debut in the Nehru Cup against Thailand at the age of 19 on 10 March 1995.[66][67] Bhutia scored for India against Uzbekistan in the 1995 Nehru Cup becoming India's youngest ever goalscorer, at 19.[68] In the 1997 SAFF Championship, India beat the Maldives 5\u20131 in the final, Bhutia was responsible for one goal. Two years later, the tournament was held in Goa and India successfully defended their title by beating Bangladesh 2\u20130 in the final. Bhutia scored the second goal for India after Bruno Coutinho opened the scoring and Bhutia was named as the tournament's most valuable player.[69]\n\nHe also netted two goals in the final of the 2002 LG Cup held in Vietnam, in which India beat the host nation 3\u20132,[70] Bhutia's goals came either side of half-time.[71] The football tournament of the 2003 Afro-Asian Games saw India finish as runners-up behind Uzbekistan. Bhutia scored two goals in the tournament, both of which came in the 5\u20133 semi-final win over Zimbabwe.[72] In the 2007 Nehru Cup, Bhutia scored a penalty in a 6\u20130 victory over Cambodia in the opening match of the tournament.[73] He also scored in a 1\u20130 win over Bangladesh[74] and a 3\u20130 win over Kyrgyzstan.[75] Bhutia played a significant part in the final as he was involved in the build-up to N. P. Pradeep's winning goal against Syria during which India won 1\u20130 to become champions.[76]\n\nThe next successful SAFF Championship was in 2005 where Bhutia was captain, in the group stages he scored a goal in a 3\u20130 victory over Bhutan but did not score in the other two matches.[77] India progressed to the semi-finals during which Bhutia played in the 1\u20130 win over the Maldives.[77] The final was a repeat of the 1999 final, as Bangladesh were the opposition, and once again India triumphed 2\u20130 during which Bhutia scored the second goal in the 81st minute from close range after Mehrajuddin Wadoo's 33rd-minute opener.[78] He received the award for the Most Valuable Player and also the Fair Play trophy.[78] The 2008 SAFF Championship started with a 4\u20130 win over neighbouring Nepal, Bhutia scored the second goal in the 34th minute.[79] It turned out to be Bhutia's only goal of the tournament, however, he did have several chances to score in the semi-final against Bhutan which saw India win 2\u20131 to reach the final.[80] In the final, India failed to defend their title after losing 1\u20130 to the Maldives.\n\nHe scored twice in a 2\u20131 victory in the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup against Turkmenistan to reach the semi-finals.[81] The Sikkimese Sniper scored a goal in the final against Tajikistan, during which India won 4\u20131 thanks to a Sunil Chhetri hat-trick; the victory also allowed them to automatically qualify for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.[82] He was also selected as the most valuable player of the tournament, finishing with three goals.[82]\n\nThe 2009 Nehru Cup was significant for Bhutia, as he earned his 100th cap for India in a 2\u20131 win over Kyrgyzstan, becoming the first Indian player to reach this milestone.[10] He also scored the first goal in this match to help the team recover from their opening day defeat to Lebanon.[83] In the match against Sri Lanka, Bhutia again scored an opening goal which helped India to win 3\u20131 and solidified their chances of reaching the final. He was adjudged as the \"man of the match\" for his performance.[84] Bhutia missed the final match of the round-robin, as India were already guaranteed a spot in the deciding match. He was also adjudged as \"Player of the Tournament\" for his stellar performances in all of the matches, including the decider where they beat Syria in a penalty shootout.[85][86]\n\nAt the 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar, Bhutia was injured for their first two games against Australia and Bahrain, but he came on as a second-half substitute against South Korea, but failed to save India, losing 4\u20131 as they were eliminated. Shortly after the Asian Cup, he announced his retirement for India on 24 August 2011 with a record of 40 goals in 104 appearances.[87][88][89]\n\nOn 13 November 2012, Bhutia was named the interim manager of United Sikkim to replace Belgian Philippe De Ridder, after the club's heavy 1\u201310 defeat in an I-League match against Prayag United on 10 November 2012 at the Salt Lake Stadium.[91] In January 2018, leading up to the Santosh Trophy, he was appointed the manager of Sikkim.[92]\n\nIn 2009, partnering with choreographer Sonia Jaffer,[93] he won the third season of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, the Indian version of the international series Dancing with the Stars. Bhutia earned Rs. 4\u00a0million for winning the competition, beating Karan Singh Grover and Gauahar Khan in the final.[94] Bhutia donated half of the prize money to charity and the other half was shared with his choreographer; he also said some money would go towards areas hit by Cyclone Aila. It was reported that an \"SMS Voting Frenzy\" allowed him to win after many organisations in Sikkim conducted mass voting events (this involved participants buying mobile cash cards so they could vote via SMS) to increase Bhutia's chance of winning the trophy.[95][96] This performance put Bhutia's relationship with his club Mohun Bagan in jeopardy, as he missed a friendly, as well as practice sessions, due to his participation in the reality show.[97]\n\nIn 2014, Bhutia joined the All India Trinamool Congress and unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Indian general election from Darjeeling constituency. In 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election he supported Left Front in favor of Veteran Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Ashok Bhattacharya.[98]\n\nBhutia comes from a buddhist background, although he is, by conviction, not religious - in fact an atheist.[99] The name \"Bhaichung\" literally means \"little brother\".[100] He married his longtime girlfriend Madhuri Tipnis, a hotel professional, on 30 December 2004 in his native village of Tinkitam in South Sikkim. They filed for divorce by mutual consent in Bandra court on in February 2015. His fictional hero is Howard Roark, a character from Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead, and he has a tattoo of a footballer on his arm.[101][102] The Sikkimese government has built a stadium, the Bhaichung Stadium in Namchi, the district headquarters, in honour of Bhutia. He is one of the most popular figures in the state and is considered as a role model to many Sikkimese as well to people from other states of India.[103] On 23 January 2008, Bhutia was nominated for the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award, for his contribution to Indian football.[104][105] Three days later on 26 January, India's Republic Day, he was chosen for the Padma Shri along with national swimming champion Bula Choudhury.[106]\n\nHe played in the Goal 4 Africa match held in the Allianz Arena, Munich, on 12 July 2008, for the Edu team, led by Clarence Seedorf, and scored twice.[107] In 2009, Bhutia started a foundation called the \"Indian Sports Foundation\" to help footballers overcome serious injuries.[108] He is also the president of the Football Players' Association of India (FPAI),[108] an organisation that promises \"fair treatment\" of Indian footballers by dealing with financial aspects such as pension plans.[109] He formed FPAI after seeing the Professional Footballers' Association in England.[110]\n\nHe signed an endorsement deal with Adidas India Marketing Pvt. Ltd in November 2003.[111] Currently he is endorsing Nike India. After completing the deal to become the brand's ambassador for India, Bhutia said \"I am confident that Nike will help elevate the sport in the country.\"[112]\n\nIn 2008, Bhutia was solicited to run with the Olympic torch in India, but he refused to carry the torch to show support for the Tibetan independence movement. \"I sympathise with the Tibetan cause. I'm against violence but I thought I should stand by the Tibetan people in their fight,\" Bhutia said.[113] He was the first Indian sportsman to refuse to carry the Olympic torch.[113] His actions have won him little praise from his colleagues in India however, who criticised him for mixing sports with politics.\n\nIn 2011, Bhutia was caught in the Sikkim earthquake. Although he was not injured, his United Sikkim offices were completely destroyed. In the aftermath, he joined with several Bollywood actors like Neha Dhupia and Rahul Bose to raise money for earthquake victims.[114]\n\nIn 2018, after the break up with All India Trinamool Congress, he established a new party on 31 May. The name of the party is \"Hamro Sikkim Party\".\n\nOn 28 October 2010, he started Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools in Delhi in partnership with Carlos Queiroz and Nike.[115][116]\n\nBhutia was born on 15 December 1976 in Sikkim. His parents were farmers. He has two older brothers, And one elder sister.[18] Bhutia was married to Madhuri Tipnis a hotelier in 2004. They successfully filed their Divorce in 2015 in Bandra court. (2004-2015)[1] He is a father to three children, two girls and one boy. \n\nEast Bengal\n\nMohun Bagan\n\nBengal\n\nIndia\n\nIndia U23\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaichung_Bhutia"}, {"id": 20, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/55/1088068/original/gorden-tallis-athletes-photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Gorden Tallis", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/gorden-tallis/1088068", "desc": "Gorden James Tallis (born 27 July 1973) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s.

Nicknamed the \"Raging Bull\" for his on-field aggression, at the peak of his career", "full_desc": "\n\nGorden James Tallis (born 27 July 1973), also known by the nickname of \"Raging Bull\" for his on-field aggression,[3] is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. A Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative second-row forward, he captained both these teams as well as the Brisbane Broncos with whom he won the 1997, 1998 and 2000 Grand Finals, after starting his career with the St. George Dragons in Sydney. At the peak of his career Tallis was considered as the best second-row forward in the world[4] and in 2008 was named in an Indigenous Australian rugby league team of the century. He is currently a commentator and pundit for the Fox Sports network. He served as a National Rugby League board member and was a member of the board of directors for the North Queensland Cowboys. Tallis also worked on the coaching staff of the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\n\nTallis is of Greek descent. Tallis' father Wally played rugby league briefly for Leigh in the 1960s.[5] Gorden Tallis was born in Townsville, North Queensland on 27 July 1973. There he played for the Centrals Tigers club.\n\nTallis moved to Sydney to make his first grade debut in the Winfield Cup premiership for St. George on 29 August, 1992, aged 19.In 1992 Tallis played for NSW City under 19s.[6] He was a reserve in St George's 1993 grand final loss to Brisbane. Tallis was used to bad effect off the interchange bench during the 1994 season and also made his representative debut for the Queensland side in the final two State of Origin series games that year. In 1995 he was included in the Tongan squad for the 1995 World Cup but had to withdraw due to injury.[7]\n\nWhen the proposed Super League competition was put on hold in 1995, Tallis offered to buy out the final year of his contract with St George in order to join the Broncos.  The Dragons declined the offer however, and subsequent court action held him to his original contract.  Having already signed a Super League contract to play with Brisbane, the fiery North Queenslander caused controversy when he was the only player who chose to sit out the 1996 season rather than play a final year with St George.[8] After having made 54 appearances for the Dragons, he left Sydney.\n\nTallis returned to the game with the Broncos for the 1997 Super League season and was the most dominant forward in the competition, which culminated in Brisbane's crushing 26\u20138 win over the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in the Telstra Cup grand final. In addition to representing Queensland in the Super League Tri-series competition, he made his international debut in the 1997 post season's Super League Test series against Great Britain, playing at second-row forward in all three matches.\n\nIn 1998 Tallis returned to St. George for the first time since his acrimonious split with the Saints and was pelted with garbage and insults and was loudly booed every time he touched the ball before his try secured a 30\u201318 victory.[9] Brisbane went on to capture another premiership with Tallis scoring a try and winning the prestigious Clive Churchill Medal as the best and fairest player on-field in the club's 38\u201312 1998 NRL grand final win over the Canterbury Bulldogs. Tallis made his Australian Kangaroos Test debut in the second match of the Trans-Tasman series.\n\nHe continued his great personal form when chosen for the ANZAC Test in 1999 and spearheaded Queensland's State of Origin campaign in a historic tied series. However, the season ended with Brisbane's failure to defend its premiership and Tallis was ruled out of October's Tri-Nations competition because of injury.\n\n2000 saw him score a try in Australia's 52\u20130 thrashing of New Zealand in the ANZAC Test, but after being sent off in the opening State of Origin match for verbally abusing referee Bill Harrigan, Tallis suffered the ignominy of a whitewash defeat (his public admission that the 'dead' third match of the series should be cancelled was a momentary lapse in judgment that may have indirectly contributed to the Blues' 56\u201316 win). If Tallis' stature as the most dominant forward in the game wasn't secure following Brisbane's 14\u20136 win over the Roosters in the 2000 NRL grand final, his four tries in Australia's 82\u20130 humiliation of Papua New Guinea before the 2000 World Cup, and his selection as Australian captain for the match against Russia (which resulted in a record 110\u20134 victory) did.  In 2000, Tallis also received the Australian Sports Medal. Following Australia's World Cup victory, Tallis and teammate Shane Webcke wrote an open letter to players appealing for an end to scandalous behaviour amongst footballers which had been tarnishing the sport.[10]\n\nHaving won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos traveled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with newly appointed captain Tallis playing at second-row forward in Brisbane's loss. Tallis captained a rookie Queensland team in the 34\u201316 win over New South Wales in the opening match of the 2001 State of Origin series and was named man-of-the-match. Soon after, he suffered a career-threatening neck injury in a club match against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles which revealed a spinal condition that required corrective surgery. While Tallis' season was over (despite the smokescreen of his naming on the Broncos' interchange bench for the club's preliminary final) he made a strong return to football in 2002. It was in the deciding match of the 2002 State of Origin series that Gorden Tallis performed a famous tackle on Blues fullback, Brett Hodgson, dragging him several metres and eventually tossing him out of the field of play like a rag-doll. Tallis' reaction later of giving the one-finger salute to a section of the crowd, right behind the northern try-line where Dane Carlaw's series-tying try was scored, became a major after-match talking point. Tallis gained some sympathy when it was revealed that he was objecting to an offensive sign about his mother. But many again raised questions about his capacity to captain Australia with debate raging over the choice between Tallis or Andrew Johns to succeed Brad Fittler. Days later Johns was chosen to lead the Kangaroos in the July Test against Great Britain. Tallis scored a try in Australia's 64\u201310 win in that match and was later named Test leader (in Johns' absence) for the one-off Test against New Zealand in October, which Australia also won 32\u201324.\n\nIn January 2003, Tallis' book Raging Bull was published. His ancestry and ethnicity has been the subject of many questions much to the bemusement of Tallis. In his book, Tallis addresses these questions;\n\n\"People ask me about my ethnic background. Newspapers pick me in their \"fantasy\" Indigenous and Aboriginal sides. To tell the honest truth, I haven't worried too much about it. An auntie of mine did some research and she found that my great-grandfather came from North Western Ambrym in Vanuatu and my great-grandmother was from Loh Island in the Torres Strait. All we were ever told in my family was that we were Australians. My dad was born in Townsville and his dad was born in Bowen, so that makes us Australian and we\u2019re proud of it. I have played in one Indigenous side though, the Redfern All Blacks, who won the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tournament in 1992. That was some side. We had Choc Mundine who was about 17, Tricky Trindall who was 25, and Wes Patten who was 19. People might have read a bit into me playing in that tournament but to me it was just a chance to play some footy with my mates.\"\n\nAt the end of 2003, Tallis, who was expected to lead Australia on the 2003 Kangaroo tour[11] announced his retirement from representative football, but continued playing with the Broncos.  In 2004 he started to feel more affected by his neck injury and took heed of the warning signs his body was emitting.  He played his last official match in the 2004 semi-final for the Brisbane Broncos, fittingly in his hometown of Townsville, against the Cowboys, which the Broncos lost.  At the time of his retirement, he held the Broncos' club record of most career tries for a forward.\n\nDuring the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Tallis.[12]\n\nIn 2010 Tallis was inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame.[13]\n\n1998-2003\n\n2002-2003\n\n[14]\n\nClive Churchill Medal: 1998\n\nDally M Second Rower Of The Year: 1999\n\nIndigenous Team of the Century: 2008\n\nNRL Team of the 1990s: 2003\n\n[15]\n\nIn 2005 Tallis was appointed as one of News Ltd's members on the NRL board, replacing John Brass[16] but stood down from the role in 2008, amid speculation that he will join the coaching staff of Catalans Dragons.[17] He was a director on the board of the North Queensland Cowboys, a role he had to relinquish when he joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs as a forwards coach.[18] He was brought in by Russell Crowe to add his knowledge and aggression to the team.[19] Tallis commentates games for Fox Sports, as well as providing written columns for newspapers.  Tallis has made his views on fighting clear on the Fox Sports broadcasts of Rugby League, stating that if a fight erupts, \"he would run in, you would run in, we would all run in, because it's your mate getting bashed\".[20]\n\nDuring the 2010 NRL season after it was announced that South Sydney Rabbitohs head coach John Lang would be retiring, incoming replacement coach Michael Maguire from the Wigan Warriors announced that Tallis' services as forwards coach were no longer required.\n\nIn 2016, Tallis was immortalised with a Gord-e-moji[21] emoji keyboard, in the same vein as his contemporary Kim Kardashian's \"Kimoji\". The app was developed for iOS by Devotion Digital in Sydney, with plans to roll out an Android version later in 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Tallis was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.[22]\n\nIn August 2019, Tallis called for the NRL to relocate Sydney teams and called crowds at Sydney games as \"Embarrassing\".  Tallis went on to say \u201cCould the NRL put in some key performance indicators to move one of the Sydney teams?, It\u2019s got to go on fans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to go on filling a stadium. It\u2019s got to go on people wanting to watch you, coming through the gate to pay to watch your brand, your style of football, Roosters are on top of the table and count their fans with a fork to get their numbers up, There\u2019s nothing worse when you watch a game of footy and there\u2019s no one there, you get embarrassed\".[23]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorden_Tallis"}, {"id": 21, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/79/1573077/original/michael-chopra-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Michael Chopra", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/michael-chopra/1573077", "desc": "Rocky Michael Chopra (born 23 December 1983) is an English professional footballer who last played as a striker for the Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League.\nA product of the Newcastle United youth system, he spent six years at the club without managing to secure a regular first team place, instead spending time on loan at Watford, Nottingham Forest, and Barnsley.

He was sold to Cardiff City for \u00a3500,000 in June 2006, and won a place on the PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2006\u201307 season. He then made a \u00a35 million move to Premier League side Sunderland in July 2007, before returning to Cardiff on a loan deal that was made permanent in July 2009 for \u00a33 million. He again was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009\u201310 campaign, before being sold on to Ipswich Town for \u00a31 million in June 2011. He joined Blackpool on a free transfer in July 2013, before moving to the Indian Super League with the Kerala Blasters for the inaugural 2014 season. Chopra signed for Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic in March 2015, playing for the side for a year before being released in March 2016. He returned to India to play for the Kerala Blasters again before retiring. As of 2022 Michael has since come back out of retirement to play with West Allotment Celtic.\n\nHe has represented England at the under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-20 levels. In 2006, he scored what was then the fastest goal by a substitute in Premier League history, scoring after being on the pitch for 15 seconds. A gambling addiction made him fall in severe debt and he had to seek professional help to overcome his addiction.\n\nBorn in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, Chopra attended Gosforth High School in Newcastle, and owing to his goal-scoring exploits there, and later with the Montagu Boys' Club, was recruited to the Newcastle United academy in July 1993.[2] Being an unused substitute for Newcastle in a Premier League match against Charlton Athletic in October 2002, Chopra signed a three-year contract with the club on 30 October.[3]\n\nChopra made his professional debut on 6 November, at St James' Park against Everton in the League Cup. Coming on as a substitute for Lomana LuaLua, he missed a penalty kick in the shootout, sending Everton to the round of 16.[4] He made his UEFA Champions League debut in December 2002 against Barcelona. Coming on as a substitute for Lualua, in the final minutes of the match, Newcastle was handed a 3\u20131 defeat.[5]\n\nFurther playing once for the club against Bayer Leverkusen,[6] Chopra was loaned to second-tier club Watford for five matches on 25 March 2003.[7] During his short loan spell, he scored five goals in as many matches, which included four goals against Burnley. Being behind Alan Shearer, Craig Bellamy, Shola Ameobi and LuaLua in the pecking order, Watford manager Ray Lewington expressed his desire to re-sign him on loan for the next season. He said that Chopra \"had an experience he wouldn't have believed a month ago having played in an FA Cup semi-final.\"[8] On 11 May 2003, Chopra made his Premier League debut as the season ended with a 1\u20131 draw at West Bromwich Albion, he again replaced LuaLua with eight minutes remaining.[9] In September of the same year, the BBC reported that Indian club Mohun Bagan was interested in signing him.[10]\n\nFailing to find a goal in the 2003\u201304 season, Newcastle loaned Chopra to Nottingham Forest for a month in February 2004.[11] He failed to find the net, as he ended the season playing eleven times without scoring.[12] At the start of the 2004\u201305 season, he was loaned for a month to League One club Barnsley in August.[13] Making his debut against Hull City,[14] he would score his first goal for Barnsley against Hartlepool United, opening a 1\u20131 draw at Victoria Park.[15] Scoring a total of five goals, his loan was extended in November till the end of the season.[16] In the rest of the season, Chopra scored twelve times[17] \u2013 including two hat-tricks, one against Peterborough United[18] and another against Huddersfield Town.[17]  New Barnsley boss Andy Ritchie intended to sign Chopra in the summer to play alongside Paul Hayes, but was unsuccessful.[19]\n\nChopra began the 2005\u201306 season back in Newcastle's first team, scoring his first senior goal for Newcastle in the 3\u20131 away win to Slovak side Dubnica on 17 July in UEFA Intertoto Cup. Making his second start for Newcastle, he opened the scoring in the fourth minute of the match.[20] In the second leg of the match, he suffered concussion, with Sky Sports reporting that he would miss the next game against Spanish club Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a.[21] Nevertheless, he played in that match where he \"slid home Charles N'Zogbia's cross at the far post\".[22] In a Tyne\u2013Wear derby against Sunderland on 17 April 2006, Chopra scored his only Premier League goal and the fastest by a substitute \u2013 finding the net after coming on fifteen seconds earlier.[23][24] Later in that season Chopra injured his knee ligaments, which he claimed to be the \"worst injury\" he ever had.[25]\n\nAfter becoming frustrated at his failure to make an impact at Newcastle, Chopra signed for Cardiff City in June 2006 for \u00a3500,000. On his decision to leave Newcastle, Chopra stated that he had shown loyalty to the club and expressed his desire to receive the same loyalty from the club. He also added that he would love to return to Newcastle in the future.[26] During the season, Chopra scored 22 goals in 44 matches.[27] He helped the club remain top of the Championship throughout September, earning the Championship Player of the month for September.[28] He was also featured in the PFA Team of the season (an annual award given to a set of 44 footballers in the top four tiers of English football).[29]\n\nIn July 2007, newly promoted Premier League side Sunderland agreed a deal worth up to \u00a35\u00a0million, activating a release clause, to sign Chopra on a four-year contract.[30] His Geordie roots and high price-tag caused unrest among some Sunderland fans.[31] He scored on his debut for the \"Black Cats\" on the opening day of the 2007\u201308 season at the Stadium of Light, coming on as a substitute late in the second half and scored the winning goal against Tottenham Hotspur in injury time.[32] He scored in the next game at Birmingham City,[33] but then went 15 games without scoring before he converted a penalty at Reading on 23 December.[34][35][36] He went on to score the only goal of a 1\u20130 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park,[37] before he scored his sixth and final goal of the season in Sunderland's 3\u20132 win over Tees\u2013Wear derby rivals Middlesbrough,[38] finishing as the second highest scorer at the club, being just one goal behind Kenwyne Jones.[39] After missing the initial matches for \"personal problems\", he scored two goals in his second game of the 2008\u201309 season as Sunderland beat Middlesbrough 2\u20130 on 20 September.[40]\n\nWith the arrivals of Djibril Ciss\u00e9 and El-Hadji Diouf, Chopra found his playing time to be limited.[41] So he rejoined Cardiff City in November on a two-month loan.[42] Chopra made his debut against Queens Park Rangers playing the entire ninety minutes of the 1\u20130 defeat.[43] In the next match against Crystal Palace, he found his first goal. Chopra converted a 31st-minute penalty the saw Cardiff winning the match 2\u20131.[44] Scoring five goals in this spell, he was recalled from loan by the new Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia to the squad, with The Guardian writing that he was \"excited\" to return to the squad.[45] Chopra rejoined Cardiff on loan in February 2009 for the rest of the season, with the transfer becoming permanent at the end of the season. Cardiff chairman Peter Ridsdale said that Chopra was \"over the moon\" about the transfer.[46] During his second loan spell at the club, he found the net four times.[12]\n\n\"Michael Chopra is on fire, he's scored seven goals already and he's shown he will get the goals if he gets the supply.\"\n\nDave Jones[47]\n\nChopra completed a permanent move on 1 July following the opening of the transfer window for a fee of \u00a33\u00a0million. The transfer smashed the club's transfer record which was previously held by the \u00a31.75\u00a0million signing of Peter Thorne from Stoke City in 2001.[48] He scored on his debut, netting the first and third goals in a 4\u20130 victory over Scunthorpe United.[49] Chopra then would score in consecutive matches against Blackpool, Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers.[50] In the post-match ceremony, manager Dave Jones commented, \"Chopra is on fire, he's scored seven goals already and he's shown he will get the goals if he gets the supply\".[47] Chopra finished the season with a total of 21 goals,[50] including a four-goal haul against Derby County.[51] For a second time, he was included in the PFA Team of the Year.[52]\n\nAfter the season, Goal.com reported that Ipswich Town had lodged a \u00a33 million bid to secure Chopra's services.[53] Though it was increased, he continued the next season with Cardiff City.[54] In the 2010\u201311 season, he suffered a hamstring injury during a match against Barnsley on 23 April 2011 ruling him out of action for 10 to 12 weeks. A statement released by the club confirmed the blow, speculating that they would be required to finish the season without him[55] However, he would return to feature in both the legs of the Championship play-offs against Reading. In the second leg, he was near to scoring, only for his shot to be deflected by Reading captain Matt Mills.[56][57]\n\nOn 10 June 2011, Chopra penned a three-year deal with Ipswich Town signing for an undisclosed fee, which was reported by East Anglian Daily Times to be \u00a31.5 million.[58] Manager Paul Jewell revealed that he was the type of player the club was searching for.[59] After signing, Chopra said that he was hungry for goals.[60] He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City.[61] He also scored a goal in each of the two matches against his former club Cardiff City.[61] He ended the season as the club's top scorer with 14 goals.[61] However, Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club, where he scored five times in thirty six matches. Unhappy with his performance, manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club.[62] Nevertheless, he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford. Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match, he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter.[63]\n\nThough he was close to signing with Barnsley, Chopra signed for Blackpool in July 2013.[61] Wales Online wrote that he joined the club to regain his \"goal touch\".[61] He said that the Blackpool move was a fresh start for him.[64] He also expressed his confidence of scoring goals playing alongside the two wingers \u2013 Tom Ince and Matt Phillips.[65] In January of the following year, he was fined for a tweet in which he criticised the club's training schedules.[66] During his time with the side, he made 20 appearances but failed to score in any of them.[61]\n\nIn August 2014, Chopra confirmed his participation in the inaugural season of the Indian Super League. He said that he felt honoured to \"involved in this new era\".[67] He was drafted by Kerala Blasters which was managed by David James. In an interview, he said that he felt honoured to \"play for a team that is owned by Sachin Tendulkar\".[68] He made his debut in the first match against NorthEast United FC, coming as a substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat, with The Times of India commenting that he \"looked sharp\".[69] His time in India was cut short by an injury which he suffered in a training for a match against Atl\u00e9tico de Kolkata. Goal.com criticized him for his poor \"fitness level\" and wrote that he never \"impressed in the competition and failed to find the back of the net\".[70] Nevertheless, he played the 120 minutes of the semifinal against Chennaiyin FC, and also started the final against the Kolkatan side where he managed two shots on goal.[70] He ended the season playing nine times without scoring.[70]\n\nReflecting on his stint in first season of Indian Super League, Chopra admitted that ISL turned out to be much more intense and competitive than he had anticipated. He said, \"I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I thought it was going to be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.[71]\n\nOn 17 March 2015, Chopra signed for Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic for the rest of the season.[72] On that very day, he made his debut against Rangers.[73] On 2 May 2015, he scored his first goal for Alloa when he scored from six yards out in a league match against Cowdenbeath.[74] Four days later, he scored his second goal for the club, as he opened the scoring in a 2\u20130 victory against Brechin City in the relegation play-offs.[73] Chopra was released by Alloa due to injury in March 2016, exactly one year after he signed for the club.[75]\n\nOn 7 August 2016, Chopra signed to make a return to Kerala Blasters after not being retained by them in 2nd edition of Indian Super League.[76]\n\nTo show that his injury prone ankle would hold up to the rigours of the league and not affect the club's bid to bounce back from a poor finish in the previous season, Chopra had a three-week training stint with Pune outfit DSK Shivajians before joining the Blasters\n\nOn 14 October 2016, he scored his first goal for Kerala Blasters, the only goal in a 1\u20130 win, playing at home against Mumbai City FC.[77]\n\nOn 27 June 2022, Chopra signed for Northern League Division One side West Allotment Celtic.[78]\n\nChopra has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-20 levels. He played in the 2000 UEFA European Under-16 Championship and the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship.[79]\n\nBorn and raised in England, Chopra is eligible to play for India through his father. In November 2010, Chopra entered into talks over acquiring an Indian passport in order to represent India in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. However, without an Indian passport, and the Indian government's refusal to change its stance on dual citizenship, Chopra cannot play for India without first renouncing his British citizenship.[80] In August 2014, Chopra stated that he wanted to play for India at international level, and was willing to renounce his British citizenship to do so.[81]\n\nChopra retired from football in 2016, going on to work as a football agent in Amsterdam.[82] In July 2017, it was reported that Chopra had enrolled on an AIFF D-License coaching course.[83]\n\nChopra appeared in OK! magazine in October 2007 to announce he had become engaged to Heather Swan, and that they were expecting their first baby. On 15 February 2008, they welcomed a 6\u00a0lb 10\u00a0oz baby boy, Sebastian Rocco Thomas Chopra.[84] In July, it was reported that the couple had split only weeks after their \u00a3250,000 wedding,[85] but they later reconciled as she vowed to \"stand by him\" as he entered rehab for his gambling addiction, which included a spell at the Sporting Chance clinic.[86][87] In September 2008 the police were called to Chopra's home in response to a domestic abuse call.[88] In 2009, Chopra was publicly dumped by his wife on Facebook.[89] He was re-admitted to the same clinic for three weeks in October 2011.[86] In December 2011, Ipswich Town gave Chopra a \u00a3250,000 loan to help pay off his gambling debts.[90]\n\nIn December 2011, Chopra and his father were involved in a cocaine drugs trial in Newcastle upon Tyne crown court.[91] On 4 October 2012, Chopra was one of three footballers among a group charged by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) over an investigation into \"suspicious betting activity\". The allegations focus on horses being laid to lose on betting exchanges.[92] On 25 January 2013, he was found guilty of this offence and given a 10-year ban from racing by the BHA.[93] In 2014 he found himself in serious trouble with Blackpool FC after a foul-mouthed Twitter rant complaining about training.[94]\n\nIn 2020, Chopra was involved in a consortium that sought to buy Newcastle United alongside fellow former Magpies striker Alan Shearer.[95]\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chopra"}, {"id": 22, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Chick Henderson", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/chick-henderson/7169415", "desc": "John Hamilton \"Chick\" Henderson was a South African rugby union footballer and commentator.\nA native of Johannesburg, Henderson was educated at Michaelhouse, the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Oxford.

Hartson also played in the Premier League with Arsenal, West Ham United, Wimbledon, Coventry City and West Bromwich Albion, and in the Football League for Luton Town and Norwich City.\n\nHartson earned 51 international caps for Wales, scoring 14 goals. He later held the position of head coach for Wales's strikers.\n\nJohn Hartson was born on 5 April 1975 in Swansea, the third of four children to Cyril and Diana Hartson. Cyril had played football for local team Afan Lido. Hartson grew up in Talycoppa, Swansea, alongside his elder brother James, elder sister Hayley and younger sister Victoria.[2] As a youngster Hartson represented Lonlas Boys' Club in Skewen, playing his first match aged six.[3] He joined Luton Town's Youth Training Scheme at the age of sixteen but was suspended four months later for stealing a bank card from the son of a couple with whom he was lodging. He used the card to withdraw \u00a350 in order to fund his gambling addiction. Hartson was suspended and sent home to Swansea but was reinstated by Luton shortly afterwards and allowed to resume his apprenticeship.[4]\n\nHartson turned professional in 1992 and made his Luton Town first team debut as a substitute in a 1\u20130 League Cup defeat to Cambridge United on 24 August 1993.[5] In January 1995, at 19, he joined Arsenal for \u00a32.5 million, a British record fee for a teenage player at the time.[6][7]\nAlong with Chris Kiwomya,[8] Hartson was one of George Graham's last signings before the manager's sacking in February 1995. He made his Arsenal debut on 14 January 1995, a 1\u20131 home draw with Everton, and scored his first goal for the club the following week, the only goal in a 1\u20130 away win at Coventry City. He was a regular for the remainder of his first season, a highlight of which was scoring Arsenal's 75th-minute equaliser in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final against Real Zaragoza; however a last-minute goal from 40 yards by Nayim over David Seaman meant Arsenal lost the game 2\u20131. He was strike-partner to Ian Wright, being favoured ahead of Kevin Campbell to fill the gap left by the injured Alan Smith, who retired at the end of the season.[9][10][7]\n\nFollowing the signing of Dennis Bergkamp, who was preferred up front to partner Wright, Hartson went on to feature under Graham's successors Bruce Rioch and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. With Wenger wanting him to stay at the\nclub, Hartson though in February 1997 linked up with West Ham United in a \u00a33.2 million deal. At the time, he was the most expensive player to be signed by West Ham. The deal was initially reported to be worth \u00a35 million.[9][10][7]\n\nIn total, Hartson played 53 times for Arsenal, scoring 14 goals.[8]\n\nHartson made his debut for West Ham on 15 February 1997 alongside another new signing, Paul Kitson. West Ham lost 1\u20130 to Derby County and Hartson was booked.[11] His first West Ham goal came in his next following game on 24 February 1997, a 4\u20133 home win over Tottenham Hotspur.[12] In his first season, he scored five league goals from eleven games and was instrumental in helping West Ham rise from 18th when he joined to a final league position for 1996\u201397 season of 14th.[13] The next season saw Hartson finish, with 24 goals in 42 games in all competitions, as West Ham's top scorer. Hartson's goal tally was in all a considerable margin ahead of the next highest scorer, Eyal Berkovic with nine goals.[14] He was also the second highest scorer, behind Andy Cole in the Premier League in that season. In the 1998 close season, Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards and assistant manager Brian Kidd expressed their desire for Hartson to sign for Manchester United to manager Alex Ferguson. However, Ferguson decided against making a bid for Hartson.[15] In a training ground incident in September 1998, Hartson kicked West Ham teammate Eyal Berkovic in the face, after the Israeli midfielder had punched Hartson in the leg as he attempted to help Berkovic to his feet. The incident was captured on camera. Hartson was fined and admitted in his biography that it was an error of judgement.[16] Berkovic said of the incident \"If my head had been a ball, it would have been in the top corner of the net\".[17]\n\nHis form suffered and he managed only four goals from twenty games in season 1998\u201399.[18] His final game on 13 January 1999, saw West Ham lose 1\u20130 in an FA Cup tie against his hometown club, Swansea City.[19]\n\nHartson played 73 times and scored 33 goals for the east London club.[20]\n\nHartson joined Wimbledon in January 1999, becoming the club's most expensive signing ever at \u00a37.5m.[21] His time with the Dons was marred by injury, though he still managed a respectable goal tally, first in the Premier League, then the First Division following the club's relegation in 2000. Proposed moves to Rangers,[22] Tottenham[22] and Charlton fell through due to doubts over the player's fitness. Hartson instead joined Coventry City on a pay-for-play deal in February 2001.[23]\n\nHartson made his Coventry debut against former club West Ham on 12 February 2001.[24] He went on to score six goals in twelve league games, including a brace in a defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford.[25][26] However, despite his efforts Coventry were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season.[27]\n\nIn August 2001, Hartson joined Celtic in a \u00a36m transfer.[28] He made his debut on 4 August 2001, coming on as a substitute in a league match away at Kilmarnock.[29] He scored his first goals for Celtic when he scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win over Dundee United on 20 October 2001.[30] At the end of his first season at Celtic he helped them win the Scottish Premier League title.[31]\n\nIn December 2002, Hartson scored as Celtic were beaten 2\u20131 in the away leg of their third round UEFA Cup tie against Celta Vigo. However, with the aggregate score 2\u20132, Celtic progressed on the away goals rule. This was the first time that Celtic had remained in European competition after Christmas since 1980.[32][33] In March 2003, Celtic faced Liverpool in the UEFA Cup at the quarter final stage, drawing 1\u20131 in Glasgow.[34]\nIn the return leg at Anfield, Hartson fired the club's goal of the season with a strike past Jerzy Dudek into the top corner from over 25 yards out. Celtic won this match 2\u20130, progressing to the semi-final.[35] After scoring the winning goal against Rangers at Ibrox in late April Hartson was plagued by a back injury which meant he missed the rest of the season, including the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.[36][37] Nevertheless, he had played a major role in getting Celtic all the way through the tournament, with his goals in Liverpool and Vigo, as well as several assists. Celtic were defeated 3\u20132 in the final after extra time by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's FC Porto.[38]\n\nIn March 2004, he dropped out for the remainder of the football season for surgery to his back; however, he recovered in time for Wales' unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup. Celtic went on to win the 2003\u201304 Scottish Cup and the 2003-04 title in his absence.[39][40]\n\nIn April 2005 he shared the Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year award with Fernando Ricksen and in May he was voted the Scottish Football Writers' Association Player of the Year.[41][42] He played as Celtic won the 2005 Scottish Cup Final.[43]\n\nOn 6 November 2005 Hartson scored his 100th goal for Celtic against Falkirk.[44][45] He missed Celtic's victory in the 2006 Scottish League Cup Final through suspension.[46] He scored the only goal against Hearts, on 5 April 2006, his 31st birthday to clinch the title for Celtic.[47][48]\n\nHartson was sent off on a number of occasions, one being a notable dismissal towards the end of an Old Firm derby, when he was sent off for violent conduct along with Celtic teammate Johan Mj\u00e4llby and Rangers player Fernando Ricksen. Hartson's dismissal was overturned on appeal.[49][50]\n\nDue to the close bond Hartson felt with both Celtic Football Club and their fans, he has a tattoo of a large Celtic crest on his upper arm with the words 'You'll Never Walk Alone' underneath in honour of the song which Celtic fans sing ahead of big games. After a picture of the tattoo appeared on the internet and many Celtic F.C. forums, Hartson tweeted that the tattoo was real and in honour of the support he had received from Celtic fans during his illness. The tweet read, \"Yes my Celtic tattoo is real I had it done soon as I came out of hospital after the support I was given by the whole Celtic family.\"[51]\n\nOn 26 June 2006, Hartson signed a two-year contract with English Football League Championship side West Bromwich Albion in a \u00a3500,000 move.[52][53] Hartson scored twice on his Albion debut in a 2\u20130 Hawthorns win against Hull City on 5 August 2006.[54]\n\nOn 31 August 2007, The Times said that Hartson had signed for League One club Nottingham Forest on a loan move. On 5 September 2007, the Western Mail reported that Hartson had rejected a firm approach from Forest and was on the verge of signing for his hometown club Swansea City on loan. However the club quickly issued a statement on its website denying the striker was set to sign.\n\nIn October 2007 Hartson joined Norwich City on a month's loan.[55] Although Norwich had the option to extend the loan until 31 December, newly appointed manager Glenn Roeder decided to send Hartson back to the Midlands after the initial month period.[56] He then rejected an offer to join Chester City on loan.[57] In January 2008 Hartson was released by West Bromwich Albion, six months before the end of his contract.[58]\n\nOn 7 February 2008, Hartson announced his retirement from football, citing his long-term struggles with weight and fitness as major reasons for finishing his career.[59]\n\nHartson won 51 first team caps for Wales, scoring 14 goals. He is currently the 11th highest scorer of all time for the Welsh.[60]\n\nHe also holds a record for the Wales U21 team by being one of only four people to have scored a hat-trick at that level alongside Craig Davies, Lee Jones and Ched Evans.[61]\n\nHartson retired from international football in February 2006 in order to concentrate on his career with Celtic[62] but in August that year he stated that he would come out of retirement to play if John Toshack needed him.\n\nJust a few weeks after his retirement from playing, East Stirlingshire in the Scottish Football League Third Division offered Hartson the chance to succeed Gordon Wylde as manager, but Hartson rejected the opportunity, saying that, \"the timing is just not right for me at the moment.\"[63] Hartson joined Setanta Sports as a pundit for the 2008\u201309 season, as part of the broadcaster's coverage of the Scottish Premier League.[64] A Welsh speaker, Hartson appears regularly as a studio guest on S4C's Sgorio.[65] He was also a regular pundit on ITV's coverage of the FA Cup until ITV lost the rights to the competition at the end of the 2013/14 season, and often appears on BBC Radio 5 Live's coverage of both Premier League and Champions League games as a match summariser. In 2011 Hartson was appointed part-time coach with Newport County.[66] In 2016, he joined BT Sport to provide analysis on the newly launched BT Sport Score.[67]\n\nIn July 2009 Hartson received chemotherapy after being diagnosed with testicular cancer which had spread to his brain.[68] It was later reported the cancer had spread to his lungs and that he remained in a \"critical condition\" following emergency surgery.[69] The treatment was successful and by December of that year it was reported that the cancer had been virtually eradicated from Hartson's body although he would have more surgery and treatment to come.[70] Hartson is a lifelong Swansea City supporter.[71]\n\nArsenal[74]\n\nCeltic[75]\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hartson"}, {"id": 24, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/80/1588218/original/milene-domingues-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Milene Domingues", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/milene-domingues/1588218", "desc": "Milene Domingues Aganzo (born 18 June 1979) is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a midfielder.", "full_desc": "\n\nMilene Domingues Aganzo (born 18 June 1979), also known as Ronaldinha, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a midfielder.\n\nBorn in S\u00e3o Paulo, Domingues played in a promotional futsal team of models run by the Flash Book modeling agency.[1] In 1994 this team formed the basis of a new SC Corinthians women's team.[2] She finished her playing career with CF Pozuelo de Alarc\u00f3n.

He won 20 caps for Scotland.\n\nGray was the lead football pundit for Sky Sports (since it began its broadcast of the Premier League in August 1992) and was the channel's co-commentator for nearly 19 years (often working alongside Martin Tyler) until his dismissal in January 2011, following multiple allegations of sexism. Gray, along with former Sky Sports anchor Richard Keys, then signed for talkSPORT in February 2011. They both now work for beIN Sports in Doha, Qatar; since June 2013 they have been the main presenters of Premier League and UEFA Champions League match broadcasts within the Middle East and North Africa region.[4]\n\nBorn in Glasgow and with a mother from the Isle of Lewis,[5] Gray started his professional career as a player with Dundee United, where he scored 36 goals in 62 appearances He also played for Dundee United in the 1974 Scottish Cup Final finishing on the losing  side as Celtic ran out 3-0 winners.\n\nIn October 1975, at the age of 19, he moved south to Aston Villa (newly promoted to the First Division) for \u00a3110,000 and was joint winner of England's golden boot with Arsenal's Malcolm Macdonald in 1976\u201377. His 29 goals helped Villa to a fourth-place finish and victory in the League Cup, and earned him the PFA Young Player of the Year and PFA Players' Player of the Year awards, a double matched by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 and Gareth Bale in 2013. At the time he was the youngest player to earn the Players' Player of the Year award, and the first player to win more than one of the official three player of the year awards in the same season.[6]\n\nGray moved to Villa's local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers on 8th September 1979. His signing was announced to the fans and media prior to The Wolves kick off at home to Crystal Palace, as a pre match celebration at the Molineux for an English record transfer fee of \u00a31.49m. After scoring the winning goal for Wolves in the 1980 League Cup final, he remained with the club through their relegation in 1982 (despite interest from Manchester United) and promotion a year later.[7][8]\n\nGray moved to Everton in November 1983 for \u00a3250,000. He spent two seasons with the Merseyside club, winning the FA Cup in May 1984. Gray scored in the final against Watford in controversial fashion by heading the ball out of the Watford's goalkeeper's hands.[9] A year later, he won the League Championship and European Cup Winners' Cup, also scoring in the final of the latter. He also reached another FA Cup final, but this time he was on the losing side as Everton were defeated by Manchester United. Then came the arrival of England striker Gary Lineker from Leicester City in the 1985 close season.[10] Despite angry petitions from Everton fans wanting to keep Gray at Goodison Park, he left the club on 10 July 1985, returning to Aston Villa in a \u00a3150,000 deal.[11]\n\nDespite starting the decade on a high as league champions in 1981 and European Cup winners in 1982, Villa had now declined to mid table mediocrity and the return of Gray was unable to turn things around as his arrival at Everton had done. He scored five goals from 35 league games in 1985\u201386 as Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division, and the following season he didn't score in 19 league games as Villa fell into the Second Division. He began the 1987\u201388 season still with Villa, but was transferred to their local rivals West Bromwich Albion in September 1987 having not featured in a first team game for Villa that season. His spell at Albion lasted less than a year, and was uneventful as they narrowly avoided relegation from the Second Division.[12]\n\nIn mid-1988, he joined Rangers. He spent one season at Ibrox, helping them win the Scottish Premier Division title \u2013 the first of nine successive titles they would win.[13] He dropped into non-league football with Football Conference club Cheltenham Town in summer 1989, and scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20130 home win over Chorley on 21 October 1989, before retiring in 1990.[14]\n\nGray's Player of the Year accolades in England were surprisingly not enough to convince Scotland manager Ally MacLeod to select him for the 1978 World Cup squad. Gray won 20 caps for Scotland, scoring 7 goals for his country. He also won four caps at Under-23 level and played at schoolboy level. His full international debut came on 17 December 1975 in a 1\u20131 draw with Romania. He was not selected for any of Scotland's World Cup squads during his playing days. His final senior appearance for Scotland came on 28 May 1985 in a 1\u20130 win over Iceland in a 1986 World Cup qualifier. This had been his first cap for two years, despite him scoring twice in his penultimate appearance for the national side on 19 June 1983 in a 2\u20130 friendly win over Canada, and him excelling on the club level for Everton after his transfer to the Merseyside club later in 1983.[15]\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Gray entered coaching as an assistant to Ron Atkinson at Aston Villa[16] before focusing full-time on his television work.\n\nAfter leaving coaching, Gray became a football commentator, pundit, and analyst on Sky Sports, serving as a Scottish facet of its Premier League coverage since its inception in 1992, most notably alongside studio anchor Richard Keys and lead match commentators Martin Tyler and Ian Darke. In addition, he reported for Sky from Euro 2004 in Portugal, although Sky did not have broadcast rights for the games. He commentated for BBC Radio 5 Live in the 2002 World Cup and for ESPN in Euro 2008. Gray also provides betting tips for Betfair,[17] and also provided commentary for the EA Sports's FIFA of video games along with Clive Tyldesley and Martin Tyler from FIFA 06 to FIFA 11, until being replaced in FIFA 12 by Sky Sports pundit Alan Smith.[18]\n\nIn January 2011, Gray was forced to apologise for comments he made about a female assistant referee, Sian Massey, in a Premier League match.  Believing that his microphone was switched off, Gray commented to co-host Richard Keys: \"Can you believe that? A female linesman. Women don't know the offside rule.\" Keys replied: \"Course they don't.\" The comments were criticised by Sky Sports, football fans and the Football Association.[19] On 24 January it was announced that both Gray and Keys would be banned for one game.[20] On 25 January 2011, it was announced his contract was being terminated for unacceptable behaviour.[21] Barney Francis, Sky Sports' managing director, said Gray was dismissed \"in response to new evidence of unacceptable and offensive behaviour in an off-air incident that took place in December 2010\".  The Daily Telegraph suggested that the Sky statement refers directly to a clip of Gray and Charlotte Jackson in rehearsals for the Sky Sports Christmas Special. While Jackson is attaching a microphone pack, Gray lifts his belt and says: \"Charlotte, can you tuck this down here for me?\"[22][23]\n\nIn late 2011 Keys and Gray appeared in Smash It!, a show designed for the corporate hospitality circuit. The title of the show came from sexual remarks that Keys had made to Jamie Redknapp.[24] An earlier theatre tour in 2011 had to be cancelled due to poor ticket sales.[25] \nHe currently presents a Friday evening Talk Sport show with sidekick Richard Keys.\n\nSince June 2013, both Andy Gray alongside Richard Keys have been presenting the Premier League football coverage on beIN Sports.[4]\n\nGray's former teammate at Everton, Peter Reid, suggested that Gray's dismissal may have been connected to a legal battle between Gray and the former title News of the World (both it and Sky were owned by News Corporation at the time) over phone-tapping.[26]\n\nOn 25 January 2014, Gray returned to commentating on British television on BT Sport for an FA Cup match between Stevenage and Everton. His appearance occurred three years to the day since his dismissal by Sky. He then commentated alongside Darren Fletcher for the Arsenal v Liverpool match in the next round.[27]\n\nGray has been married to Rachel Lewis, a former model who was previously married to his long-time friend and agent Michael Lewis, since 10 February 2012.[28][29] Gray was previously married to Vanessa Taylor and Jacqueline Cherry, and also had relationships with Sara Matthews and Janet Trigg.  Gray has five children.[30]\n\n(NB scores and results list Scotland's goal tally first)\n\nAston Villa\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nEverton\n\nRangers\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Gray_(footballer,_born_1955)"}, {"id": 27, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/21/419497/original/alan-shearer-photo-u6?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Alan Shearer", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/alan-shearer/419497", "desc": "Alan Shearer, CBE, DL (born 13 August 1970) is an English retired footballer.

In 1996, he came third in both Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards. In 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[2] Shearer was one of the first two players inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021.[3]\n\nShearer played his entire career in the top level of English football. He started his career at Southampton in 1988 before moving to Blackburn Rovers in 1992, where he established himself as among the most prolific goalscorers in Europe. Whilst at Blackburn Rovers, he won the 1994\u201395 Premier League, as well as two consecutive Premier League Golden Boots. In the summer of 1996, he joined his hometown club Newcastle United for a then world record \u00a315 million. He led Newcastle to the 1998 FA Cup and 1999 FA Cup finals, and eventually became the club's all-time top scorer.[notes 1] He retired at the end of the 2005\u201306 season.\n\nFor the England national team, Shearer appeared 63 times and scored 30 goals.[4] UEFA Euro 1996 was his biggest success at international football; England reached the semi-finals and Shearer was awarded the UEFA Euro Golden Boot and was named in the UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament. He went on to represent England at 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. Shearer retired from international football following the end of the latter competition.\n\nSince retiring as a player in 2006, Shearer has worked as a television pundit for the BBC. In 2009, he briefly left his BBC role to become Newcastle United's manager in the last eight games of their 2008\u201309 season, in an unsuccessful attempt to save them from relegation. Shearer is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, a Freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law of Northumbria and Newcastle Universities.\n\nAlan Shearer was born in the Gosforth area of Newcastle upon Tyne on 13 August 1970,[5] the son of Anne and sheet-metal worker Alan Shearer. His parents were working class. His father encouraged him to play football in his youth, and Shearer continued with the sport as he progressed through school. He was educated at Gosforth Central Middle School and Gosforth High School. Growing up, he played on the streets of his hometown and was originally a midfielder because \"it meant [he] could get more involved in the games\".[6] Shearer captained his school team and helped a Newcastle City Schools team win a seven-a-side tournament at St James' Park, before joining the amateur Wallsend Boys Club as a teenager. It was while playing for the Wallsend club that he was spotted by Southampton's scout Jack Hixon, which resulted in him spending his summers training with the club's youth team, a time he would later refer to as \"the making of me\".[6] Shearer had successful trials for First Division clubs West Bromwich Albion, Manchester City and Newcastle United, before being offered a youth contract with Southampton in April 1986.[6]\n\nShearer was promoted to the first team after spending two years with the youth squad. He made his professional debut for Southampton on 26 March 1988, coming on as a substitute in a First Division fixture at Chelsea,[1] before prompting national headlines in his full debut at The Dell two weeks later. He scored a hat-trick, helping the team to a 4\u20132 victory against Arsenal, thus becoming the youngest player \u2013 at 17 years, 240 days \u2013 to score a hat-trick in the top division, breaking Jimmy Greaves' 30-year\u2013old record.[1] Shearer ended the 1987\u201388 season with three goals in five games, and was rewarded with his first professional contract.[6]\n\nDespite this auspicious start to his career, Shearer was only eased into the first team gradually and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the following season. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength,[7] which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates.[1] Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989\u201390 season,[8] and in the next, four goals in 36 games. His performances in the centre of the Saints attack were soon recognised by the fans, who voted him their Player of the Year for 1991.[6][8]\n\nIn the middle of 1991, Shearer was a member of the England national under-21 football squad in the Toulon Tournament in Toulon, France. Shearer was the star of the tournament where he scored seven goals in four games.[8] It was during the 1991\u201392 season that Shearer rose to national prominence. 13 goals in 41 appearances for the Saints led to an England call-up;[9] he scored on his debut,[10] and was strongly linked in the press with a summer move to Manchester United. A possible move for Shearer was being mentioned in the media during late autumn of 1991, but he rejected talk of a transfer and vowed to see out the season with Southampton, resisting the temptation of a possible transfer to the two clubs who headed the title race for most of the season. Speculation of a transfer to Liverpool, who finished the season as FA Cup winners, also came to nothing.[6]\n\nDuring the middle of 1992, Southampton's manager, Ian Branfoot, became \"the most popular manager in English football\", as he took telephone calls from clubs \"trying to bargain with players they don't want plus cash\". Although Branfoot accepted that a sale was inevitable, he claimed that \"whatever happens, we are in the driving seat\".[11] In July 1992, Shearer was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of \u00a33.6 million, with David Speedie reluctantly moving to The Dell as part of the deal. Despite Branfoot's claim to be \"in the driving seat\", Saints failed to include a \"sell-on clause\" in the contract. Shearer, less than a month off his 22nd birthday, was the most expensive player in British football.[12] In his four years in the Southampton first team, Shearer made a total of 158 appearances in all competitions, scoring 43 goals.[8]\n\nDespite making just one goalless appearance as England failed to progress past the Euro 1992 group stages,[13] Shearer was soon subject to an English transfer record-breaking \u00a33.6\u00a0million bid from Blackburn Rovers.[14] Although there was also interest from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, Blackburn benefactor Jack Walker's millions were enough to prise the striker from Southampton, and Shearer moved north to Ewood Park in the middle of 1992.[15]\n\nOn 15 August 1992, the opening weekend of the first Premier League season, Shearer scored twice against Crystal Palace with two strikes from the edge of the 18-yard box.[16] He missed half of his first season with Blackburn through injury after snapping his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992, but scored 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature.[9] Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4\u20130 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. However, Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances were hit by a run of poor form.[6]\n\nReturning to fitness for the 1993\u201394 season, he scored 31 goals from 40 games as Blackburn finished runners-up in the Premier League.[9] His performances for the club led to him being named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for that season.[17] On the international scene, England had failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals,[18] but Shearer added three more goals to his international tally before embarking on his most successful domestic season as a player to date.[15]\n\n\"Shearer is the classic working class sporting hero\u00a0... everything legend demands an English centre-forward should be\u00a0... As a striker he comes closer to fitting the Roy of the Rovers fantasy than anyone else lately admired by English crowds\".\n\nShearer as described in The Guardian on 10 April 1995.[19]\n\nThe arrival of Chris Sutton for the 1994\u201395 season established a strong attacking partnership at Blackburn. Shearer's 34\u00a0goals coupled with Sutton's 15, helped the Lancashire club take the Premier League title from archrivals Manchester United on the final day of the season,[20] and the duo gained the nickname \"the SAS\" (Shearer And Sutton).[15] After being asked by the press how he planned to celebrate winning the title, Shearer replied with \"creosoting the fence\".[21] Shearer also had his first taste of European football in the UEFA Cup that season, and scored in the second leg as Blackburn went out in the first round, losing to Trelleborgs FF of Sweden.[22] His efforts for the club led to Shearer being awarded the PFA Players' Player of the Year for 1995.[23]\n\nAlthough the club could not retain the title the following year, Shearer again ended the (now 38-game) season as Premier League top scorer, with 31\u00a0goals in 35\u00a0games,[24][25][26] as Blackburn finished seventh in the league. The previous season's first-place finish also saw the club enter the Champions League. Shearer's only goal in six full Champions League games was a penalty in a 4\u20131 victory against Rosenborg BK in the final fixture[15] and Blackburn finished third in their group, failing to progress to the next stage.[27]\n\nHe passed the 100-goal milestone for Blackburn in all competitions on 23 September 1995, scoring a hat-trick in their 5\u20131 home win over Coventry City in the Premier League. On 30 December, he scored his 100th Premier League goal, making him the first player to hit the landmark, in a 2\u20131 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. His final tally for the club was 112 goals in the Premier League and 130 in all competitions. His final goals for the club came on 17 April 1996, when he scored twice in a 3\u20132 home league win over Wimbledon.[28]\n\nShearer's international strike rate had also dried up, with no goals in the twelve matches leading up to Euro 96.[15] He missed the final three games of the season for his club due to injury, but recovered in time to play in England's UEFA European Championship campaign.[29]\n\nAfter Euro 96, Manchester United and Real Madrid again sought to sign Shearer, and attempted to enter the battle for his signature.[30] However Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards and Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz stated that Blackburn Rovers refused to let Shearer go to Old Trafford or Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Ultimately Shearer joined his boyhood club: Newcastle United, Manchester United's title rivals.[31]\n\nOn 30 July 1996, for a world transfer record-breaking \u00a315 million (equivalent to \u00a330 million today) Shearer joined his hometown club and league runners-up Newcastle United, managed by his hero Keegan.[6][32][33] Shearer made his league debut away at Everton, on 17 August 1996,[34] and maintained his form during the rest of the season, finishing as Premier League top-scorer for the third consecutive season with 25\u00a0goals in 31 Premier League games,[26][35][36] as well as winning another PFA Player of the Year accolade,[23] despite a groin injury forcing him to miss seven matches. Perhaps his best performance of the season came on 2 February 1997,[37] when Newcastle went into the final 15 minutes of the game 3\u20131 down at home to Leicester City in the league, only for Shearer to win them the game 4\u20133 by scoring a late hat-trick.[38] However, the league title still eluded the club, who finished second in the league for a consecutive year, with Keegan resigning midway through the season.[35]\n\nAnother injury problem, this time an ankle ligament injury sustained in a pre-season match at Goodison Park, restricted Shearer to just two\u00a0goals in 17\u00a0games in the 1997\u201398 season. His injury was reflected in the club's form, and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League. To help Shearer get over the injury, club physiotherapist Paul Ferris devised unorthodox methods. At the club's training ground at Durham University, Ferris stacked six school benches and placed Shearer on top with high-jump mats either side \u2013 the striker trying to improve his balance by standing on one leg and bending over to pick up coins while having objects thrown at him, while a crowd of student onlookers watched on.[39] However, United (now managed by Shearer's old boss at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish) had a good run in the FA Cup; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi-final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final. The team were unable to get on the scoresheet at Wembley, and lost the game 2\u20130 to Arsenal.[40]\n\nAn incident during a game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA,[41] with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge.[42] The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence.[43] Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld, a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.[44]\n\nAn almost injury-free season helped Shearer improve on his previous year's tally in the 1998\u201399 season, the striker converting 14\u00a0goals in 30 league games and replacing Rob Lee as Newcastle captain,[45] but Newcastle finished 13th again, with Ruud Gullit having replaced Kenny Dalglish just after the season got underway.[46] He also helped Newcastle to a second consecutive FA Cup final and qualification for the following season's UEFA Cup, scoring twice in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, but they once again lost 2\u20130, this time to treble-chasing Manchester United.\n\nOn the opening day of the 1999\u20132000 season, Shearer received the first red card of his career in his 100th appearance for Newcastle.[47] After dropping Shearer to the bench in a Tyne-Wear derby loss against Sunderland,[48] the unpopular Gullit resigned to be replaced by the 66-year-old Bobby Robson.[49] Despite Gullit giving Shearer the captain's armband, reports of a rift between club captain and manager were rife, Gullit's decision to drop Shearer proved deeply unpopular with fans and his departure capped a dismal start to the season.[50] The animosity between Shearer and Gullit was later confirmed by the latter, who reported telling the striker that he was \"...the most overrated player I have ever seen.\"[51] Ironically, Robson had tried to sign Shearer for Barcelona in 1997, making a bid of \u00a320million which would have seen Shearer break the world's transfer fee record for the second time in 12 months. However, then Newcastle manager Kenny Dalglish rejected the offer.[52]\n\nIn Robson's first match in charge, Shearer scored five goals in an 8\u20130 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday.[53] With Robson in charge, the team moved away from the relegation zone, finishing in mid-table and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, but a third consecutive final was beyond them as they were beaten by Chelsea. Shearer missed only one league game and notched up 23\u00a0goals.[9]\n\nShearer suffered an injury-hit and frustrating season in the 2000\u201301 season, having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football.[54] He managed only five\u00a0goals in 19\u00a0games in the league. The 2001\u201302 season was much better though: Shearer bagged 23\u00a0goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth \u2014 their highest standing since 1997 \u2014 meaning they would qualify for the following season's Champions League competition. One of the most memorable incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle's 4\u20133 win over the Red Devils in September 2001.[55][56] Shearer also saw red for the second time in his career this season, after allegedly elbowing an opposition player in a match against Charlton Athletic, however, this decision was later rescinded.[57]\n\nThe 2002\u201303 season saw Shearer and Newcastle make their return to the UEFA Champions League. Newcastle lost their first three matches in the opening group stage, but Shearer's goal against Dynamo Kyiv,[58] coupled with further wins against Juventus and Feyenoord saw the club progress to the second group stage.[59]\n\n\"I know at first hand how fierce the gladiatorial battles are between a striker and defenders. So, to maintain your performance as a top class goalscorer over a long period of time takes phenomenal dedication, self belief and enormous willpower. If you then throw in a number of serious injuries...how many? Three? And for the man to still be producing at the highest level is really an amazing feat. After a match against Juventus I met Alex Del Piero who like myself could only speak in the most glowing of terms about Shearer. He'd terrorised the Juve defenders when the clubs met in Newcastle. They found him one of the most difficult opponents they had ever faced. The coach Marcello Lippi had been purring about Shearer's performance. So much so that his strikers Alex, David (Trezeguet) and Marcelo (Salas) were ordered to take home videos and study Shearer's display.\"\nShearer's Champions League hat-trick against Bayer Leverkusen and a brace against Inter Milan in the second group stage helped him reach a total of seven Champions League goals, along with his 17 in 35 games in the league, and a total of 25 for the season as the team again improved to finish in third place in the Premier League.[61]\n\nAfter this, Newcastle would have one more chance to progress in the Champions League in early 2003, but Shearer was one of those who failed to score as the team were eliminated in a penalty shootout by Partizan Belgrade in the third qualifying round. United progressed well in that season's UEFA Cup and Shearer's six goals helped the club reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten by eventual runners up Olympique de Marseille. Domestically he also had a good season, with 22\u00a0goals in 37\u00a0appearances,[9] however this did not prevent the club dropping out of the Champions League places to finish in fifth,[62] qualifying once again for the UEFA Cup.[63]\n\nAnnouncing that this would be his final season before retirement, Shearer's form in the 2004\u201305 season was patchy; alongside new signing Patrick Kluivert, he scored only seven\u00a0goals in his 28\u00a0games as the club finished the season in 14th place.[9] The club fared better in the cup competitions, however, eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. Shearer scored a hat-trick in the first round win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals, in addition to his one goal in domestic cups.[9]\n\nThe middle of 2005 saw Shearer reverse his decision to retire, after persuasion from manager Graeme Souness.[64] He decided to continue playing in a player-coach capacity until the end of the following season.[65] and he returned for one more season in the 2005\u201306 season. This last season saw him break Jackie Milburn's 49-year-old record of 200\u00a0goals for Newcastle United (not including his 38 World War II Wartime League goals)[66] when he netted his 201st strike in a home Premier League fixture against Portsmouth on 4 February 2006, becoming the club's highest-ever league and cup competition goalscorer with 201 goals altogether.[67] On 17 April 2006, with three games remaining in his final season as a player, Shearer suffered a tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee after a collision during a 4\u20131 win at Sunderland in which he scored his 206th and final goal in what was his 395th appearance for the club. The injury caused him to miss those final three games, effectively bringing forward his retirement.[68] Shearer finished his final season with 10\u00a0goals in 32 league games.[9]\n\nIn tribute to Shearer's contribution to Newcastle United over more than ten years, the club erected a large banner of Shearer on the outside of the cantilever superstructure of the Gallowgate End of St James' Park. The banner measured 25 metres (82\u00a0ft) high by 32 metres (105\u00a0ft) wide, covering almost half of the Gallowgate End, aptly placed above the club bar, Shearer's Bar, opened in his honour in 2005. The banner depicted Shearer as the \"Gallowgate Giant\", with one arm aloft in his signature goal celebration, with the message \"Thanks for 10 great years\", and was featured in the media coverage reflecting on his career at the club,[69][70][71] with the banner being displayed from 19 April 2006 until 11 May 2006, the day of his testimonial match. The banner could be seen across the city and as far away as Gateshead across the River Tyne, standing taller than the iconic local landmark, the Angel of the North.[citation needed]\n\nShearer was awarded a testimonial match by the club, against Scottish side Celtic. All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes. Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland, Shearer was unable to play in the whole match; however, he kicked off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty, helping Newcastle win the game 3\u20132.[72] The match was a sell-out, and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family, with his young son covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute.[72]\n\nShearer's international career began in 1990 when he was handed a callup to the England under-21 squad under Dave Sexton. During his time with the squad, he scored 13 times in 11 games, a record return which is still unbeaten.[73][74] The striker's goals at this level, coupled with his club form, meant he was soon promoted to the senior squad by coach Graham Taylor. Marking his debut in the 2\u20130 win against France in February 1992 with a goal,[10] he made his only appearance for the England B team a month later. Due to replace Gary Lineker, who retired from international action after UEFA Euro 1992, in the England attack,[75] Shearer played only intermittently in the qualifying campaign for the 1994 FIFA World Cup due to injury and the team failed to reach the competition finals.[76]\n\nUEFA Euro 1996 was a more positive experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required to qualify as hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior,[15] and even his overall goalscoring record for England did not look too impressive so far, with five goals in 23 games.[77] However, he found the net in the 22nd minute of the first game, against Switzerland.[78] Scoring once in the following game against Scotland and twice in a 4\u20131 win over the Netherlands,[78] Shearer helped England to progress to the next stage in front of their own fans in Wembley.[79]\n\nIn the quarter-finals, England were outplayed by Spain but got through to a penalty shootout after a goalless draw. Shearer scored the first England penalty,[78] while the Spaniards failed to score from two of theirs, sending England into the semi-final against Germany. Shearer headed England into the lead after three minutes, but the Germans quickly equalised and the match went to penalties again. This time, Germany won from the spot; although Shearer scored, his teammate Gareth Southgate missed his kick and England were eliminated. Shearer's five\u00a0goals made him the competition's top scorer,[78] and together with teammates David Seaman and Steve McManaman, was listed in the official UEFA team of the tournament.[citation needed]\n\nThe new England manager Glenn Hoddle appointed Shearer captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996, and the player held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and twice in the following game against Poland. He scored a total of five\u00a0goals in England's successful qualification campaign for the World Cup, adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally.[15] Shearer was sidelined for much of the 1997\u201398 season,[80] but recovered to play in the World Cup finals. With Michael Owen replacing Teddy Sheringham as Shearer's strike partner, Shearer's return saw him score England's first goal of the tournament, in a 2\u20130 win over Tunisia, his only goal in the three group matches.[78] England faced long-time rivals Argentina in the second round. Shearer scored a first-half equaliser from the penalty-spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half. In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in what could have been the winning goal only for the referee to disallow it due to Shearer having elbowed goalkeeper Carlos Roa. The scores tied 2\u20132, the game went to penalties. Shearer scored again, but England were eliminated after David Batty's shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper.[81] This defeat ended England's participation in what was to be Shearer's only World Cup tournament.[13]\n\nIn September 1999, Shearer scored his only England hat-trick in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Luxembourg.[citation needed] This helped England reach a play-off against Scotland; England won the game over two legs and in doing so qualified for the European Championships. By now, Shearer was approaching his 30th birthday, and he announced that he intended to retire from international football after the Euro 2000 tournament.[15]\n\nShearer did not score in England's opening 3\u20132 defeat against Portugal, but did so as England defeated Germany 1\u20130 in Charleroi,[82] ensuring that England beat their European neighbours for the first time since the 1966 World Cup Final. To remain in the tournament, England only required a draw against Romania in the final group match, and Shearer scored a penalty as England went in at half-time 2\u20131 up, but Romania ultimately won 3\u20132.[82] England's tournament was over, and so was Shearer's international career. From his 63 caps, he captained the team 34 times and scored thirty\u00a0goals;[83] he is ranked joint-sixth in the England all-time goalscorers list with Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney.[84] Shearer remained in international retirement despite speculation of a return during the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship campaigns, and further declined an offer to be assistant manager to Steve McClaren after the 2006 World Cup \u2013 a position ultimately filled by Terry Venables.[85][86][87]\n\nWidely regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation and one of the greatest players in the history of the Premier League,[88] Shearer was often styled as a classic English centre-forward, owing to his strength, physical stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be a highly prolific goalscorer.[89][90] Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head.[91] Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his link-up play, work-rate, and early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him of some of his pace.[92][93] Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players.[94] Although his strength allowed him to hold on to the ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism \u2013 most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this that contributed to both of his dismissals, although one was later rescinded on appeal.[95][96] As well as the two red cards, Shearer received 59 yellow cards during his career.[citation needed] In addition to his playing ability, he also stood out for his leadership qualities throughout his career.[97]\n\nShearer was noted as a proficient penalty taker for both club and country,[98][99] and he scored 45 times from the spot for Newcastle, where he was the first-choice taker; with 56 goals from 67 attempts, he is also the most prolific penalty-taker in Premier League history. He also scored five goals from free-kicks for the north-east club. He was known for his accuracy and shooting power from outside the penalty area either when taking set-pieces or from open play.[91][100][101][102]\n\nOn his retirement as a player, Shearer responded to speculation of an immediate move into coaching, saying that he would take some personal time off to \"enjoy life\" for the next couple of years. He was also quoted as saying that he would eventually like to move into management,[103] \"when the time was right\"[104] however as of March 2009 he was yet to start the UEFA Pro Licence course,[105] which is required to be permitted to manage a team in the Premier League and European competition.[106]\n\nReflecting his desire for personal time off to \"enjoy life\", in July 2006 he turned down a coaching role with England, citing his BBC commitments and desire to be away from the pressure of a job within football.[107] Despite this, Shearer was often linked in the media with managerial or coaching positions at his three former clubs.[108][109]\n\nShearer took a brief role in the dugout for his final three games under Glenn Roeder. Shearer had rejected offers of coaching or assistant roles at Newcastle under both the returning Kevin Keegan in February 2008 and Joe Kinnear in November 2008.[110][111] Shearer had previously had talks about, but never been offered, a full-time manager's role at Newcastle until his appointment on 1 April 2009.[112]\n\nIn a surprise move, late on 1 April 2009, it was announced that Shearer would become the manager of his former club Newcastle United for the remaining eight games of the season, taking over from head coach Chris Hughton who was in temporary charge while the permanent manager Joe Kinnear recovered from heart surgery, having taken ill on 7 February. Shearer stated \"It's a club I love and I don't want them to go down. I'll do everything I can to stop that.\"[113][114]\n\nShearer was unveiled at a press conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias.[112] In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time, Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position, including his two other previous Premier League clubs.[112] Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment, Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games, and after his recovery, Joe Kinnear would return as manager after the end of the season.[112] Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8-week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role.[112] Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement, with Shearer stating that \"the people that have moved, were moving on anyways, that had nothing to do with me\".[112] Wise's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager.[115] Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant.[112] Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical, physio and dietary matters.[112] Ferris had previously worked with Shearer in his playing days, and had been at the club for 13 years[112] prior to an earlier departure under then manager Glenn Roeder.[116]\n\nHis first match in charge ended in a 2\u20130 defeat against Chelsea at St James' Park.[117] On 11 April, Newcastle earned their first point under Shearer with a 1\u20131 draw with Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium with Andy Carroll scoring a late equalising goal.[118] After a defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and a draw against Portsmouth, his first win for Newcastle came in a 3\u20131 victory over Middlesbrough that lifted Newcastle from the relegation zone.[119]\n\nOn the eve of the final day of the season on 24 May, where all fixtures are played simultaneously, Newcastle faced the prospect of being relegated to the Championship, along with Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland, which would end their 16-year unbroken spell in the Premier League.[120] After losing 1\u20130 at Aston Villa with Damien Duff scoring an own goal, Newcastle were relegated with local rivals Middlesbrough, joining West Bromwich Albion whose relegation had been confirmed in previous weeks, while Sunderland and Hull City survived. Shearer's eight games yielded only five points out of a possible twenty-four.[120]\n\nShearer did not get the manager's job on a permanent basis. Chris Hughton stepped up from the coaching staff to take charge of the quest to get Newcastle back into the Premier League, which was achieved at the first attempt as Newcastle finished top of the Championship in the 2009\u201310 season.[121]\n\nShearer met his future wife, Lainya, whilst playing for Southampton. They lived locally with her parents in the city during his second year at the club, and were married on 8 June 1991 at St James' Church, West End, near Southampton.  They have three children together.[6] Shearer has described his wife as a quiet and reserved person who is uncomfortable with the public attention his fame sometimes brings.[citation needed] He cited not wanting to uproot his family as a key reason for remaining in England during his career, having had the chance to move to Juventus or Barcelona when leaving Blackburn.[15] In May 2006, his family accompanied him onto the pitch at St James' Park as he performed a lap of honour following his testimonial match.[122]\n\nOn 6 December 2000, Shearer was given Honorary Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne, with the citation \"in recognition of his role as captain of Newcastle United Football Club and as former captain of England which have enhanced the reputation of the City\".[123][124][125] Shearer was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2001 Queen's Birthday Honours[126] and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours[127] for charitable services to the community in North East England.[128][129]\n\nOn 4 December 2006, Shearer was created a Doctor of Civil Law by Northumbria University, at a ceremony at Newcastle City Hall, where the university vice-chancellor declared that \"Throughout his career Alan Shearer has been hard-working, committed, disciplined and focused in his endeavours, fighting back from career-threatening injuries with great determination and courage\".[130]\n\nOn 1 October 2009, Shearer was commissioned as Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland, having been nominated by the Duchess of Northumberland in her capacity as Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, and approved for the position by the Queen.[131] In this role, Shearer, along with 21 other deputies, is the stand-in for the Duchess when she cannot fulfill her role as the Queen's official representative in the region at official engagements.[132] Deputies must live within seven miles of the county boundaries, and retain their appointment until age 75.[132] The Duchess said of the appointment that \"You could not find a more iconic person than Alan, not just for what he has done in football but for all the extra work he tirelessly does for charity and communities. I am delighted he has accepted the role of Deputy Lieutenant because he is a real role model. I have promised him he is not going to have to do too much, but even if it is just one occasion a year he is the perfect choice\"[132]\n\nOn 7 December 2009, Shearer was made a Doctor of Civil Law by Newcastle University.[133][134][135] Chancellor Liam Donaldson stated \"Newcastle United are my team. Alan Shearer is more than just a local legend, he's probably one of the greatest footballers of all time\".[134][135] On 12 September 2016, a statue of Shearer's likeness was unveiled outside St James' Park. It was sculpted by Tom Maley, and paid for by the Shepherd family.[136]\n\nOn 26 April 2021, Shearer was announced as the first inductee in the Premier League Hall of Fame.[137]\n\nAfter his retirement and following guest appearances, Shearer became a regular pundit for the BBC's Match of the Day. He also formed part of the team which covered the World Cups and European Championships from 2006 onwards for the BBC.[138]\n\nFormer Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd announced that, after Shearer finished the 2005\u201306 season as Newcastle's caretaker assistant manager, he would become the club's \"Sporting Ambassador\" for the 2006\u201307 season. However, in September 2008, tabloids reported that Shearer was removed from this largely honorary position by the club's owner Mike Ashley \u2013 though these reports were denied by the club.[139][140]\n\nDuring his playing career Shearer appeared in commercials for the sports drink Lucozade. He is among a group of high-profile athletic figures in British pop culture to promote the brand, which includes Olympic champions Daley Thompson and Linford Christie, footballer John Barnes, rugby player Jonny Wilkinson, and Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft.[141]\n\nShearer features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was included in the FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends.[142]\n\nOn 10 March 2023, following the suspension of Gary Lineker as the host of Match of the Day for allegedly breaching BBC impartiality rules by criticising the government's asylum policy on Twitter, Shearer alongside other pundits announced that they would not present the following episode of the show in solidarity with Lineker.[143]\n\nDuring his playing days, Shearer had been involved with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, taking part in the organisation's Full Stop campaign in 1999.[144] Since retiring from football Shearer has also done work for several charities both nationally and in the Newcastle area.[145][146]\n\nIn his testimonial match, he raised \u00a31.64m benefiting fourteen good causes including \u00a3400,000 for the NSPCC and \u00a3320,000 for completion of the \"Alan Shearer Centre\", a respite care facility based in West Denton, Newcastle.[147][148] In October 2006, he became an ambassador for the NSPCC, describing it as \"the kick-off to my most important role yet\".[144] He has also worked with The Dream Foundation.[149] In 2006, Shearer founded the Alan Shearer Academy Scholarship to aid the development of promising young players in the region.[150]\n\nIn 2008, he raised over \u00a3300,000 for Sport Relief in a bike ride with fellow Match of the Day presenter Adrian Chiles, the idea for which emerged in an off the cuff question from cycling fan Chiles to Shearer as to how he kept fit since retirement.[151] Shearer also played and scored twice in Soccer Aid, a game involving celebrities and former players at Wembley Stadium in September 2008, to raise money for UNICEF.[152]\n\nOn 26 July 2009, Shearer played and scored in the Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, a charity match held at St James' Park in tribute of Bobby Robson and in aid of his cancer charity the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.[153] It proved to be Robson's last public appearance, as he died five days later.[154] On 15 October 2009, Shearer became the new patron of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.[155]\n\nSouthampton\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nNewcastle United\n\nEngland U21\n\nEngland\n\nIndividual\n\nRecords\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer"}, {"id": 28, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "John Drake", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/john-drake/10192622", "desc": "John Alan Drake (22 January 1959 \u2013 13 December 2008) was a New Zealand rugby union footballer who represented the All Blacks and Auckland as a tighthead prop.\nHe played twelve times for New Zealand including eight test matches.

Tesamen Hogerop Diest (two spells, in 1999\u20132000 and November 2000 \u2013 June 2001) and Mechelen (July\u2013November 2000).\n\nClijsters was endorsed by Diadora.[4]\n\nAfterwards, Clijsters managed the professional tennis career of his daughter Kim. After her retirement, \"Lei\" became coach of third division club Tongeren, with which he had also played, in October 2007. He resigned in January 2008, after his family announced that he was suffering from a serious illness. Details were kept secret, but in February the Belgian press reported it to be metastatic melanoma[5] and that treatment was not working.[2]\n\nClijsters played in 40 international matches for the Belgium national team, participating at UEFA Euro 1984 and the 1986 and 1990 FIFA World Cups.\n\nIn the 1986 edition, as Belgium reached the last four, he only appeared in two matches (being used as a substitute in the 2\u20131 win over Iraq and the famous round of 16 4\u20133 victory over the USSR.\n\nIn 1990, Clijsters saw action against South Korea (2\u20130 win), Uruguay (in which he scored a header in a 3\u20131 triumph[6]) and England (1\u20130 loss after extra time).\n\nClijsters was married to Els Vandecaetsbeek from 1982 until 2005.[7]\n\nOn 4 January 2009, Leo Clijsters succumbed to an illness at age 52.[8][9] Upon his death, Belgian newspapers like Het Laatste Nieuws revealed that he suffered from a recurrence of melanoma which had spread to the lungs and other organs, having already experienced a bout of this condition twenty-five years earlier.[10]\n\nKV Mechelen[11]\n\nBelgium\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei_Clijsters"}, {"id": 30, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/52/1020993/original/1020993-photo-u27?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Franz Beckenbauer", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/franz-beckenbauer/1020993", "desc": "Franz Anton Beckenbauer (pronounced [\u02c8f\u0281ants \u02c8b\u025bkn\u0329\u02ccba\u028a\u0250]; born 11 September 1945) is a German former professional  footballer and manager.

In his playing career he was nicknamed Der Kaiser (\"The Emperor\") because of his elegant style, dominance and leadership on the field, and also as his first name \"Franz\" is reminiscent of the Austrian emperors. He is widely regarded to be one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.[1][2] A versatile player who started out as a midfielder, Beckenbauer made his name as a central defender. He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper (libero).[3] With success at club and international level, he is one of nine players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.\n\nTwice named European Footballer of the Year, Beckenbauer appeared 103 times for West Germany and played in three FIFA World Cups and two European Championships. He is one of three men, along with Brazil's M\u00e1rio Zagallo and France's Didier Deschamps, to have won the World Cup as a player and as a manager; he lifted the World Cup trophy as captain in 1974, and repeated the feat as a manager in 1990.[4] He was the first captain to lift the World Cup and European Championship at international level and the European Cup at club level. He was named in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, the Ballon d'Or Dream Team in 2020, and in 2004 was listed in the FIFA 100 of the world's greatest living players.[5][6]\n\nAt club level with Bayern Munich, Beckenbauer won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1967 and three consecutive European Cups from 1974 to 1976. The latter feat made him the first player to win three European Cups as captain of his club. He became team manager and later president of Bayern Munich. After two spells with the New York Cosmos he was inducted into the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame.\n\nBeckenbauer led Germany's successful bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup and chaired the organizing committee. He worked as a pundit for Sky Germany, and for 34 years as a columnist for the tabloid Bild, both until 2016.[7] In August 2016, it was announced Beckenbauer was being investigated for fraud and money laundering as part of the 2006 World Cup.[8]  The investigation was closed without a verdict in 2020 as the statute of limitations expired.[9]\n\nFranz Beckenbauer was born in the post-war ruins of Munich, the second son of postal-worker Franz Beckenbauer, Sr. and his wife Antonie (n\u00e9e Hupfauf). He grew up in the working-class district of Giesing and, despite his father's cynicism about the game, started playing football at the age of nine with the youth team of SC Munich '06 in 1954.[10]\n\nOriginally a centre forward, he idolised 1954 FIFA World Cup winner Fritz Walter and supported local side 1860 Munich, then the pre-eminent team in the city, despite their relegation from the top league, the Oberliga S\u00fcd, in the 1950s. \"It was always my dream to play for them\" he would later confirm.[10] That he joined the Bayern Munich youth team in 1959, rather than that of his favourites 1860 Munich, was the result of a contentious Under-14 youth tournament in nearby Neubiberg. Beckenbauer and his teammates were aware that their SC Munich '06 club lacked the finance to continue running its youth sides, and had determined to join 1860 Munich as a group upon the tournament's conclusion. However, fortune decreed that SC Munich and 1860 would meet in the final and a series of niggles during the match eventually resulted in a physical confrontation between Beckenbauer and the opposing centre-half. The ill-feeling this engendered had a strong effect upon Beckenbauer and his teammates, who decided to join Bayern's youth side rather than the team they had recently come to blows with.[11]\n\nIn 1963, at the age of 18, Beckenbauer was engulfed by controversy when it was revealed that his then girlfriend was pregnant and that he had no intention of marrying her; he was banned from the West Germany national youth team by the DFB and only readmitted after the intervention of the side's coach Dettmar Cramer.[12]\n\nBeckenbauer made his debut with Bayern in a Bundesliga promotion play-off match on the left wing against FC St. Pauli on 6 June 1964. In his first season in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (\"Regional League South\", then the second level in Germany), 1964\u201365, the team won the league and eventually promoted to the Bundesliga.\n\nBayern soon became a force in the new German league, winning the German Cup in 1966\u201367 and achieving European success in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1967. Beckenbauer became team captain for the 1968\u201369 season and led his club to their first league title. He began experimenting with the sweeper (libero) role around this time, refining the role into a new form and becoming perhaps the greatest exponent of the attacking sweeper game.[1]\n\nDuring Beckenbauer's tenure at Bayern Munich, the club won three league championships in a row from 1972 to 1974 and also a hat-trick of European Cup wins (1974\u201376) which earned the club the honour of keeping the trophy permanently.\n\nSince 1968 Beckenbauer, has been called Der Kaiser by fans and the media.[1] The following anecdote is told (even by Beckenbauer himself) to explain the origin: On the occasion of a friendly game of Bayern Munich in Vienna, Austria, Beckenbauer posed for a photo session right beside a bust of the former Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I. The media called him Fu\u00dfball-Kaiser (football-emperor) afterwards, soon after he was just called Der Kaiser. However, according to a report in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, this explanation is untrue, though very popular. According to the report, Beckenbauer fouled his opposite number, Reinhard Libuda from Schalke 04, in the cup final on 14 June 1969. Disregarding the fans' hooting, Beckenbauer took the ball into the opposite part of the field, where he balanced the ball in front of the upset fans for half a minute. Libuda was commonly called K\u00f6nig von Westfalen (king of Westphalia), so the press looked for an even more exalted moniker and invented Der Kaiser.[13]\n\nIn 1977, Beckenbauer accepted a lucrative contract to play in the North American Soccer League with the New York Cosmos. He played with the Cosmos for four seasons up to 1980, and the team won the Soccer Bowl on three occasions (1977, 1978, 1980).[1]\n\nBeckenbauer retired after a two-year spell with Hamburger SV in Germany (1980\u201382) with the win of the Bundesliga title that year and one final season with the New York Cosmos in 1983. In his career, he appeared in 754 competitive club matches.\n\nBeckenbauer won 103 caps and scored 14 goals for West Germany.[1] He was a member of the World Cup squads that finished runners-up in 1966, third place in 1970, and champions in 1974, while also being named to the tournament all-star team in all three editions. He also won the 1972 European Football Championship and finished as runners-up in the 1976 edition. Beckenbauer's first game for the national team came on 26 September 1965.[1]\n\n\"The message he [Beckenbauer] sent out was: 'Don't even try it. Coming out to face me is a waste of your time.'\n\n\u2014England 1966 World Cup legend Bobby Charlton.[14]\n\nBeckenbauer appeared in his first World Cup in 1966, playing every match. In his first World Cup match, against Switzerland, he scored twice in a 5\u20130 win.[15] West Germany won their group, and then beat Uruguay 4\u20130 in quarter-finals, with Beckenbauer scoring the second goal in the 70th minute.[15]\n\nIn the semi-finals, the Germans faced the USSR. Helmut Haller opened the scoring, with Beckenbauer contributing the second of the match, his fourth goal of the tournament.[15] The Soviets scored a late goal but were unable to draw level, and West Germany advanced to the final against hosts England. The English won the final and the Jules Rimet Trophy in extra time.[1] The Germans had fallen at the final hurdle, but Beckenbauer had a notable tournament, finishing tied for third on the list of top scorers\u2014from a non-attacking position. The team returned to a heroes' welcome in their homeland.\n\nWest Germany won their first three matches before facing England in the second round in a rematch of the 1966 final. The English were ahead 2\u20130 in the second half, but a spectacular goal by Beckenbauer in the 69th minute helped the Germans recover and equalise before the end of normal time and win the match in extra time.[15] West Germany advanced to the semi-finals to face Italy, in what would be known as the Game of the Century. He dislocated his shoulder after being fouled, but he was not deterred from continuing in the match, as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions.[1] He stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling. The result of this match was 4\u20133 (after extra time) in favour of the Italians. Germany defeated Uruguay 1\u20130 for third place.[1]\n\nBeckenbauer became captain of the national side in 1971. In 1972, West Germany won the European Championship, beating the Soviet Union 3\u20130 in the final.\n\nThe 1974 World Cup was hosted by West Germany and Beckenbauer led his side to victory, including a hard-fought 2\u20131 win over the hotly favoured Netherlands side featuring Johan Cruyff. Beckenbauer and fellow defenders man-marked Cruyff so well that the Dutch were never quite able to put their \"Total Football\" into full use.[1]\n\nBeckenbauer became the first captain to lift the new FIFA World Cup Trophy after Brazil had retained the Jules Rimet Trophy in 1970.[1] This also gave West Germany the distinction of being the first European national team to hold both the European Championship and World Cup titles simultaneously (two other countries have done it since: France in 2000, and Spain in 2010).\n\nIn the 1976 competition, West Germany again reached the final, where they lost on penalties to Czechoslovakia. Beckenbauer was named in the Team of the Tournament.\n\nBeckenbauer retired from international football in 1977, at the age of 31, following his move to New York Cosmos.[16]\n\nOn his return to Germany, Beckenbauer was appointed manager of the West Germany national team to replace Jupp Derwall on 12 September 1984. He took the team all the way to the final of the 1986 World Cup, where they lost to the Diego Maradona inspired Argentina.[1]\n\nIn 1990, before the German reunification, Beckenbauer managed the last Germany national football team without East German players in a World Cup, winning the final 1\u20130, against Argentina, in a rematch of the previous World Cup final. Beckenbauer is one of three men (with Mario Zagallo, and Didier Deschamps) to have won the Cup as player and as manager, and he is the first man and one of only two (with Didier Deschamps) to have won the title as team captain as well as manager.[1]\n\nBeckenbauer then moved into club management, and accepted a job with Olympique de Marseille in 1990 but left the club within one year. Marseille eventually won the 1990\u201391 French championship and ended runner-up of the 1990\u201391 European Cup.\n\nFrom 28 December 1993 until 30 June 1994, and then from 29 April 1996 until 30 June of the same year, he managed Bayern Munich. His brief spells in charge saw him collect two further honours \u2013 the Bundesliga title in 1994 and the UEFA Cup in 1996.[17][18]\n\nIn 1994, he took on the role of club president at Bayern, and much of the success in the following years has been credited to his astute management. Following the club's decision to change from an association to a limited company, he has been chairman of the advisory board since the beginning of 2002. He stepped down as president of Bayern in 2009, being succeeded by long-time general manager Uli Hoene\u00df.\n\nIn 1998, he became vice-president of the German Football Association.[1] At the end of the 1990s, Beckenbauer headed the successful bid by Germany to organize the 2006 FIFA World Cup.[1] He chaired the organizational committee for the World Cup and was a commentator for the Bild-Zeitung.\n\nIn June 2014, Beckenbauer was banned by FIFA Ethics Committee for 90 days from any football-related activity for allegedly refusing to cooperate with an inquiry into corruption dealing with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar.[19] He protested the ban, as he had requested the questions that were put to him be in German and in writing. The ban was lifted after Beckenbauer agreed to participate in FIFA's inquiry.[20] In February 2016, Beckenbauer was fined CHF 7,000 and warned by FIFA Ethics Committee for failing to cooperate with the inquiry in 2014.[21]\n\nIn March 2016, the Ethics Committee opened formal proceedings against Beckenbauer regarding the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany.[22]\n\nIn October 2019, Black Mirror Leaks published email correspondence of Russian member of Parliament, Sergey Kapkov, where Beckenbauer and his adviser, Fedor Radmann, were named as recipients of \u20ac3\u00a0million for their votes in favour of Russia as host of the 2018 World Cup. Both allegedly received an additional \u20ac1.5\u00a0million in success fees after the 2018 cup was allocated to Russia.[23]\n\nIn 2021, FIFA closed its ethics inquiry against Beckenbauer as the statute of limitations expired.[24]\n\n\"Franz Beckenbauer symbolises football and a winning mentality. On top of that, he brought the World Cup to his own country. We're proud of him.\"\n\n\u2014German tennis player Boris Becker.[14]\n\n\"He's the hero of our nation. It hasn't happened by chance, he's earned it by hard work.\"\n\n\u2014West Germany team-mate G\u00fcnter Netzer.[14]\n\nBeckenbauer is widely considered to be one of the greatest footballers in the history of the game.[1][2] He is the only defender in football history to win the Ballon d'Or twice.[25]  He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper or libero, a defensive player who  intervenes proactively in the offensive game of his team.[3] Named European Footballer of the Year twice, Beckenbauer was chosen on the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, and the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002.[6][26]\n\nAn icon in Germany, and one of only three men to have won the World Cup both as a player and as a manager, Beckenbauer was lauded by former German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der for winning the World Cup as a player in 1974, winning as manager in 1990, and for playing a leading role in Germany's success of achieving host status of the 2006 World Cup.[14]\n\nDuring his playing career, Beckenbauer's popularity was such that he was included as a character in Monty Python's sketch \"The Philosophers' Football Match\" as the sole genuine player and a \"surprise inclusion\" to the German team. During the match, between famous Greek and German philosophers, instead of actually playing football, the \"players\" walk in circles contemplating philosophy, while \"asking questions\", a popular phrase used by English football commentators, much to the confusion of Beckenbauer.[27]\n\nIn a 2013 advertisement for South Korean company Samsung, Beckenbauer appeared as the manager of a Galaxy XI of football players from around the globe, and hands the captain's armband to Lionel Messi.[28] Beckenbauer features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was included in the FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends.[29]\n\nBeckenbauer has been married three times and has five children, one of whom, Stephan, was a professional footballer,[30][31] who died after a long illness on 31 July 2015, at the age of 46.[32] Stephan's son Luca is also a professional footballer, currently[when?] playing for SV Wacker Burghausen in the Regionalliga Bayern.[33] After appearing in an advertisement for a big mobile phone company, Beckenbauer specifically requested the number 0176 / 666666 for his mobile phone. However, he soon was flooded with phone calls by men who thought it was a phone sex number (in German, \"6\" translates to \"sechs\", sounding similar to the word sex).[34]\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, Beckenbauer had cardiac surgery twice. He also had an artificial hip inserted in 2018.[35]\n\nBayern Munich[41]\n\nHamburger SV[41]\n\nNew York Cosmos\n\nWest Germany[42]\n\nWest Germany[41]\n\nMarseille[43]\n\nBayern Munich[41]\n\nPlayer\n\nManager\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Beckenbauer"}, {"id": 31, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/61/1205774/original/ibrahim-dossey-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Ibrahim Dossey", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/ibrahim-dossey/1205774", "desc": "Ibrahim Dossey (24 November 1972 in Accra \u2013 9 December 2008 in Bucharest) was a Ghanaian football goalkeeper.", "full_desc": "\n\nIbrahim Dossey Allotey (24 November 1972 in Accra \u2013 9 December 2008 in Bucharest) was a Ghanaian football goalkeeper.\n\nDossey was born in Accra, Ghana.

His La Liga debut came on 21 March 2004, as he played 71 minutes in a 0\u20131 home defeat against neighbours M\u00e1laga CF.[4]\n\nDefinitely promoted to the first squad for the 2005\u201306 season, Puerta became intimately connected to Sevilla's history on 27 April 2006, when he scored against FC Schalke 04 in the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup: in the final moments of the match, he received a long ball and struck it with his left foot for the 1\u20130 final (and aggregate) win;[5] they went on to collect five titles in fifteen months, with Puerta scoring his penalty shootout attempt in the 2007 UEFA Cup final, against compatriots RCD Espanyol.[6] His impressive performances earned him international recognition and reported interest from Arsenal, Manchester United and Real Madrid,[7] but all bids were rejected.\n\nOn 25 August 2007, Puerta collapsed and lost consciousness in the penalty area due to a cardiac arrest during Sevilla's first La Liga fixture of the 2007\u201308 campaign at homeground S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n against Getafe CF.[8] He was seen crouching and then subsequently collapsing upon moving back to his team's goal after only 35 minutes of the game had passed,[3] as teammates Ivica Dragutinovi\u0107 and Andr\u00e9s Palop immediately ran to his side as he lost consciousness; moments later, club medical staff and other players followed suit.[9]\n\nAfter recovering and being substituted, Puerta was able to walk to the dressing room, where he collapsed once again. He was resuscitated by the doctors and taken, by ambulance, to the intensive care unit of Virgen del Roc\u00edo hospital, where he received cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\nPuerta died on 28 August 2007, at 14:30.[10][11] Doctor Francisco Murillo reported that he had suffered multiple organ failure and irreversible brain damage as a result of multiple prolonged cardiac arrests due to an incurable, hereditary heart disease known as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.[12]\n\nPuerta's girlfriend was expecting their first child at the time of his death.[3] As a mark of respect, players from both Sevilla and city rivals Real Betis attended his funeral days after his death and, subsequently, FIFA ordered the installation of resuscitation rooms in every stadium that hosted the World Cup qualifiers.[13]\n\nAs a result of Puerta's death, Sevilla's UEFA Champions League qualifier against AEK Athens F.C. was postponed until the fourth of September[14]\u2013 the former eventually won 4\u20131. The club also announced that a one-minute silence would be held before every league match on the weekend of 1\u20132 September 2007.\n\nAdditionally, Sevilla's UEFA Super Cup game with A.C. Milan on 31 August went ahead, as a tribute to the player, with all 22 participants having the name 'PUERTA' printed on the back of their jersey. The players and officials on both sides also wore black armbands.[15]\n\nSevilla subsequently retired Puerta's number 16 shirt, with the provision that should his son, Aitor Antonio (born 22 October 2007),[16] one day play for the club, he would have the option to bring the number out of retirement.[17] However, Spanish football teams were not allowed to do so, as the Royal Spanish Football Federation stated that clubs should use number 1 to 25 for their regular squad, with no additional room for manoeuvre; as a result, David Prieto wore the shirt in 2007\u201308 in honour of his friend[18] but it was later decided that only youth products could wear that jersey.[19]\n\nControversially, the number was given to Argentine Federico Fazio in 2016.[20] One year later, it was awarded to Jes\u00fas Navas, a close friend of Puerta, upon his return to the club in 2017.[21]\n\nRamos wore T-shirts in memory of Puerta after Spain won UEFA Euro 2008 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with Navas doing the same on the latter occasion.[22] Earlier in 2010, a statue of him was built in the club's Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Cisneros Palacios sporting facilities.[23][24]\n\nPuerta was capped once by the Spain national side, playing against Sweden on 7 October 2006.

He was president of the Law Society of England and Wales.[1]\n\nHe and his elder brother, Percy Melmoth Walters, were known as \"morning\" and \"afternoon\" in allusion to their initials.[2] The brothers were generally regarded as the finest fullbacks in England for a number of years; according to Philip Gibbons in his \"History of the Game from 1863 to 1900\" this was due mainly to their own defensive system based on the combination game used by the Royal Engineers during the early 1870s.[3]\n\nWalters was born in Ewell, Surrey, the son of William Melmoth Walters (1835\u20131926),[4] a solicitor and member of an old Somerset family,[5] and Marian Eleanor Leggatt (b. 1840).[6] He was educated at Windlesham House School, then Charterhouse where he played for the school football team in 1882 and 1883 before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a blue in each of the years from 1884 to 1887.[7][1]\n\nIn 1892, he married Amy Constance Parbury, the daughter of G. W. Parbury, of Ifield, Crawley[1] and they had 5 sons and 4 daughters, including Amy (born 1894), Anthony (1895), Herbert (1900), Bridget (1914) and Thomas (1917)[8] and Marion Elizabeth (born 1901).[9]\n\nIn his first year at Cambridge, Walters joined the Corinthian club which had been established two years earlier with a view to giving amateur players the opportunity to play together on a regular basis to improve the quality and strength of the England team.\n\nArthur made his debut for Corinthian on 13 November 1884, in a 7\u20131 defeat by Notts Club. He was unable to take part in the Corinthians tour of northern England in December, but was able to join the Easter tour in which five games were played in six days. Arthur played in four of the five games, including the opening fixture against Preston North End on 6 April 1885, when he played at left-back with his brother Percy alongside him on the right.\n\nThis match was the first of many over the next six years in which the two brothers played alongside each other as the two full backs. Amongst the more significant matches were a 6\u20130 defeat of the FA Cup holders, Blackburn Rovers, in December 1885 and a 7\u20130 victory over Notts County in March 1886, when fellow Old Carthusian William Cobbold scored four goals.\n\nThe brothers' final match together for Corinthian was on 8 November 1890 in an eight-goal victory over Sheffield in which younger brother H.M. Walters (who was only playing his second match) scored a hat-trick, with another goal from Percy. The other four goals came from V.G. Manns, who was playing his only match for Corinthian. Shortly after this match, the younger brother died from a football injury inflicted during a match and, in deference to their parents' wishes, both brothers retired from football to concentrate on their legal careers.[3]\n\nThe withdrawal of the Walters brothers from the Corinthian team had a significant effect on the team's performances as they were \"extremely hard to replace, and Corinthian were destined to win only six of their next nineteen games\".[10]\n\nDespite the promise made to their parents, the brothers made a return to the Corinthians for a multi-sport tournament against the Barbarians rugby club in April 1892. Arthur played in the soccer match (without Percy) which Corinthian won 6\u20130, with Tinsley Lindley scoring a hat-trick. The clubs also played a rugby match, which Corinthian won 16\u201313, although the match was not a very serious encounter and was described by The Times newspaper as \"a very amusing game\".[11] The rugby match was followed by an athletics meeting in which C. B. Fry was prominent, winning both the long jump and high jump. Finally, the two clubs met a few weeks later in a cricket match in which Percy played alongside several other prominent Corinthians, including Fry, Lindley and Charles Wreford-Brown.\n\nArthur's final Corinthian matches came when he made a brief come-back at the end of the 1892\u201393 season with appearances against Bournemouth and Queen's Park. During his time with the Corinthians, Walters made 48 appearances, scoring once.\n\nAfter graduating in 1887, Walters joined the old-boys' team for his former school, the Old Carthusians. His major successes came late in his time with the club, reaching successive FA Amateur Cup finals, winning the cup in 1894, the competition's inaugural year, and reaching the final in 1895.\n\nArthur and Percy made their England debuts together on 28 February 1885 in a 4\u20130 victory over Ireland, with Arthur at right back and Percy on the left.[12]\n\nIn the match against Scotland on 27 March 1886, nine of the eleven players selected were members of the Corinthian club, although all had their primary affiliation with other clubs. The match ended in a 1\u20131 draw, with England's being scored by fellow Corinthian Tinsley Lindley.[13]\n\nArthur made a total of nine appearances for England, with the final match being against Scotland in the 1890 British Home Championship. The match ended 1\u20131,[14] and as a result England and Scotland shared the championship. Of the nine matches played for England, four were won, three drawn (all against Scotland) and two were lost (also against Scotland).\n\nWalters spent some time as a volunteer in the army, and in August 1886, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the 3rd Surrey Rifles.[15]\n\nWalters eventually qualified as a solicitor in 1899, and joined the family firm. He was president of the Law Society of England and Wales.[1]\n\nHe became a director of the London Guarantee and Accident Co., and of the Phoenix Assurance Co.[1]\n\nHe died at his home at Minnickwood, Holmwood, Surrey on 2 May 1941 aged 76.[16]\n\nOld Carthusians\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Melmoth_Walters"}, {"id": 34, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/83/1654568/original/nat-lofthouse-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Nat Lofthouse", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/nat-lofthouse/1654568", "desc": "Nathaniel Lofthouse  (27 August 1925 \u2013 15 January 2011) was an English professional footballer who played for Bolton Wanderers for his whole career.

He won 33 caps for England between 1950 and 1958, scoring 30 goals, with one of the highest goals-per-game ratios of any England player.\n\nBorn in Bolton, Lancashire, in 1925, Lofthouse joined the town's main club on 4 September 1939 and made his debut in a wartime 5\u20131 win against Bury on 22 March 1941 when he scored two goals. It was then more than five years until he made his league debut for the club, but he eventually played against Chelsea on 31 August 1946, when he scored twice in a 4\u20133 defeat. Lofthouse would go on to play 33 games for England, but his debut on 22 November 1950 made him 25 when he finally broke into the team. He perhaps justified a claim to an earlier call-up by scoring both goals in a 2\u20132 draw against Yugoslavia at Highbury on his debut.\n\nOn 25 May 1952, Lofthouse earned the title 'Lion of Vienna' after scoring his second goal in England's 3\u20132 victory over Austria.[3] In doing so he was elbowed in the face, tackled from behind, and finally brought down by the goalkeeper. Back from national team duty, he then scored six goals in a game for the Football League against the Irish League on 24 September 1952.\n\nIn 1952\u201353, he was named FWA Footballer of the Year. He scored a goal \u2013 but was on the losing side \u2013 in the famous 1953 FA Cup Final (aka 'The Matthews Final'), having previously scored in each round. That season he topped the First Division goalscoring charts with 30 goals. He featured in the 1954 World Cup side. Lofthouse scored twice against Belgium in a match that ended 4\u20134. Injured for the next match, in the quarter final game against Uruguay he equalized in the 16th minute, after receiving the ball in the 18-yard box.[which?]\n\nOn 3 May 1958, almost five years to the day after losing the 1953 final, Lofthouse captained Bolton in the 1958 FA Cup Final against Manchester United.\n[3] There was a national wave of sympathy for United, who three months earlier had suffered grievously in the Munich air disaster. Bolton won the game 2\u20130 with Lofthouse scoring both goals, the second of which was highly controversial and remains a talking point to this day.[3] Lofthouse went into a challenge with the United keeper Harry Gregg and barged him into the net to score.[3] Shoulder charging the goalkeeper was a legitimate tactic at the time, but Lofthouse later admitted that his challenge was a foul.[3]\n\nOn 26 November 1958, Lofthouse made his final England appearance, against Wales, at the age of 33, and he officially retired from the game in January 1960 because of an ankle injury, although his final league game was not until 17 December of that year, when he suffered a knee injury against Birmingham City. Lofthouse stands eighth in the list of English football's top division all time goalscorers.[4]\n\nAfter retiring from playing football, Lofthouse became the assistant trainer at Burnden Park on 10 July 1961 and was then appointed chief coach at the club in 1967. In 1968, he spent a brief time as caretaker manager of the club and took over the job full-time on 18 December. Before becoming Bolton's chief scout, he became an administrative manager at Burnden. In 1978, he became the club's executive manager. In 1985, at the age of 60, Lofthouse became caretaker manager at the club again and became president in 1986.\n\nLofthouse was the recipient of various honours after retiring from the game. On 2 December 1989, he was made a Freeman of Bolton. On 1 January 1994, he was appointed an OBE and on 18 January 1997, Bolton decided to name their East Stand at their new Reebok Stadium after him. On 24 August 2013, a statue was dedicated.[5]\n\nOn 7 April 1993, he appeared as a special guest on the TV guest show This Is Your Life, in which the on-screen guests included Tom Finney and Harry Gregg, while others including Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker and Ian Rush appeared on screen to pay tribute to Lofthouse as they were unable to appear alongside Lofthouse due to other commitments.[6]\n\nTributes were paid to Lofthouse as he celebrated his 80th birthday, including a party at the Reebok.[7] A campaign, backed by Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association and former Bolton player, was started, aiming to get Lofthouse knighted.[8] Nat Lofthouse was an Inaugural Inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002.[9]\n\nAlready a Bolton Wanderers player having joined them in 1939 Lofthouse was conscripted in 1943 and worked in Mosley Common colliery as a Bevin Boy.[10] He married Alma Foster in 1947 and they remained married until her death in 1985.[11] They had two children, a son, Jeff, and a daughter, Vivien.[12]\n\nLofthouse died on 15 January 2011, aged 85, in a nursing home in Bolton.[13] He had suffered with dementia.[14]\nOn 24 January 2011 in Bolton Wanderers first home game since his death against Chelsea, a pre-match period of a minute's silence, thunderous applause, black-and-white footage of Lofthouse in action and the laying of floral tributes by Kevin Davies and John Terry took place before the start of the match.[15]\nLofthouse was buried on 26 January 2011 as thousands turned out to say goodbye at Bolton Parish Church. His funeral service was attended by more than 500 invited guests and members of the public. Eulogies were offered by Bolton chairman Phil Gartside and Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor, a boyhood Bolton fan and former Wanderers player.\nFormer Bolton captain Kevin Davies and then manager Owen Coyle were among the pallbearers.[16]\n\nSoon after Lofthouse's death a swell of support for a statue to be built in his memory started. A year to the day after his death, Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside announced plans for one to be built and for the statue to be situated outside the Reebok Stadium. The plan was for the statue to be funded by public donations, with help from the club.[17] It was unveiled on 24 August 2013, three days before what would have been Lofthouse's 88th birthday. It was originally scheduled to take place three days later on his birthday but the date was moved forward to coincide with Bolton's home fixture against Queens Park Rangers.\n\nIn April 1998, train operator Virgin CrossCountry named locomotive 47807 Lion of Vienna in Lofthouse's honour at Bolton station.[18]\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_Lofthouse"}, {"id": 35, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/90/1785714/original/peter-f-bell-athletes-photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Peter Bell", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/peter-f-bell/1785714", "desc": "Peter Bell may refer to:", "full_desc": "Peter Bell may refer to:\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bell"}, {"id": 36, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/24/461516/original/andy-cole-u2?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Andrew Cole", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/andy-cole/461516", "desc": "Andrew Alexander Cole (born 15 October 1971) is an English former professional footballer.

His professional career lasted from 1988 to 2008, and is mostly remembered for his time with Manchester United, who paid a British record transfer fee to sign him from Newcastle United. Cole spent six years with Manchester United and won nine trophies, including the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999.\n\nAs well as for Manchester United and Newcastle United, Cole also played in the top division of English football for Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Fulham, Manchester City, Portsmouth and Sunderland, as well as in The Football League for Bristol City, Birmingham City, Burnley and Nottingham Forest. He is the fourth-highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 187 goals, and holds Premier League records for most goals scored in a 42-game season (34),[3] and fastest to score 50 goals (65 matches), as well as being the first player to top the Premier League's goalscoring charts and assist charts in the same season in their own right, in 1993\u201394.[4]\n\nCole has the distinction of being one of the few players in England to have swept all possible honours in the English game, including the PFA Young Player of the Year award, as well as the coveted UEFA Champions League title. Cole was also capped 15 times for the England national team between 1995 and 2001, scoring once against Albania in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier.[5]\n\nCole began his career as a youth player for Arsenal on leaving school in 1988, signing professional in 1989. He made his only league appearance for Arsenal, aged 19, as a substitute against Sheffield United at Highbury during a First Division match on 29 December 1990. Arsenal won 4\u20131 but Cole did not score. He also made a substitute appearance against Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield in 1991 and almost made an immediate impact, hitting the side netting from outside the penalty area.[6] The following season, Cole was loaned to Fulham in the Third Division, where he scored three goals in 13 matches.\n\nCole joined Second Division Bristol City on loan in March 1992 before signing in a \u00a3500,000 permanent deal in the summer of 1992, at the time becoming their most expensive player. Having proved himself as a competent young goalscorer with Bristol City (who began the 1992\u201393 season in the new Football League Division One following the creation of the Premier League), Cole was quickly one of the hottest prospects in England and his name was frequently linked with Premier League clubs throughout the 1992\u201393 season.\n\nIn February 1993, Division One leaders Newcastle United broke their club transfer record by paying \u00a31.75\u00a0million to sign Cole. He then scored 12 goals in as many league matches as Newcastle cruised to the Division One title and won promotion to the Premier League. His 12 goals included two hat-tricks, the first against Barnsley on 7 April, the second on the final day of the season in a 7\u20131 hammering of Leicester City.[7] He also scored the first of the club's two goals in their 2\u20130 promotion clinching win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on 4 May.[8]\n\nAfter David Kelly was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers, manager Kevin Keegan brought in Peter Beardsley as Cole's strike partner for the 1993\u201394 Premier League campaign.\n\nCole scored 34 goals in 40 matches during Newcastle's first Premier League season as they finished third, and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time since the 1970s. His first top division goal was in a 1\u20131 draw against defending league champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on 21 August 1993.[9] This was Newcastle's first goal in the Premier League.[10] Exactly three months later, Cole scored all three goals as Newcastle defeated Liverpool 3\u20130 at home.[11] Another emphatic hat-trick followed against Coventry City in late February and with Peter Beardsley almost as lethal as his strike partner.[12] Cole scored 41 total goals in all competitions \u2013 breaking the club's goalscoring record which had been set by Hughie Gallacher nearly 70 years earlier (Gallacher still holds the record for the highest number of league goals in a season with 36).[13][14] Cole scored in 26 different Premier League appearances for Newcastle in 1993\u201394, which is a season record in the competition by a player.[15]\n\nCole was subsequently voted PFA Young Player of the Year for that season.[16]\n\nCole then scored 9 goals in 18 Premier League matches for Newcastle after the start of the 1994\u201395 season, and also scored a hat-trick against Royal Antwerp in the UEFA Cup.[17]\n\nIn all, Cole scored 68 goals in 84 matches for Newcastle, giving him a strike rate of 81%. Cole's last goal for Newcastle United came in the 1\u20131 home draw with Ipswich Town on 26 November 1994.[18]\n\nOn 10 January 1995, Cole was suddenly sold in a shock deal to Manchester United for a deal worth \u00a37\u00a0million \u2013 \u00a36\u00a0million cash plus \u00a31\u00a0million-rated Keith Gillespie going in the opposite direction, setting a new record for the most expensive British transfer.[19] Newcastle fans were saddened and confused with Keegan for selling Cole, leading to Keegan publicly confronting fans at St James' Park, against the advice of chairman Sir John Hall and first team coach Terry McDermott, explaining his reasons on the day of the transfer.[20] Cole stated his sadness at leaving the club, however felt the iconic status Newcastle fans aligned with him was premature and affecting him personally, whilst he cited Newcastle's November loss to Wimbledon as permanently damaging his relationship with Keegan.[21] McDermott stated in his autobiography that Keegan decided to sell Cole citing a drop in form and enthusiasm, whilst also hoping to sign Queens Park Rangers striker Les Ferdinand shortly following Cole's departure.[22] Ferdinand signed for Newcastle that summer.[23]\n\nDespite joining halfway through the 1994\u201395 season, Cole still managed to score 12 goals in just 18 Premier League matches for United. This included his first, the winner in a 1\u20130 victory over Aston Villa on 4 February at Old Trafford and five in the 9\u20130 rout of Ipswich Town, making him the first player to score five goals in a Premier League match. He also scored twice in away wins over Leicester City and Coventry City during the season's final stages, as his new team kept up the pressure and cut the gap between themselves and league leaders Blackburn Rovers.\n\nHowever, Cole missed two goal chances in the final minutes against West Ham United on the final day of the season as they could only manage a 1\u20131 draw and the league title went to Blackburn Rovers instead. He was cup-tied for the FA Cup Final a week later. Without him, United lost to Everton 1\u20130. United were also without the banned Eric Cantona and the injured Andrei Kanchelskis, the club's two other highest scoring players that season.\n\nCole's first full season in 1995\u201396 with Manchester United proved to be difficult, as Cole struggled to find his trademark form in a side now built around the much heralded return of Eric Cantona. Though Cole scored in four consecutive matches halfway through the season, including an important opening goal in United's 2\u20130 defeat of title rivals Newcastle United on 27 December, Cole was badgered by fans and critics alike across much of the season for only scoring 14 times and missing many chances. However, Cole picked up his form in the final stages of the season and scored crucial goals including the equaliser in the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea to help send United to Wembley Stadium again. He then collected his first Premier League title winners medal and scored the second goal in United's 3\u20130 defeat of Middlesbrough on the final day of the season to help United win the Premier League title for the third time in four years - a remarkable turnaround as his new club had been 10 points behind his old club at Christmas.\n\nHe also played in United's FA Cup final victory to become part of England's first ever side to win the double twice.\n\nBefore the 1996\u201397 season began, Cole had to deal with being offered to Blackburn Rovers as part-exchange in a \u00a312\u00a0million deal that would have brought Alan Shearer to Old Trafford, but the offer was rejected and Shearer joined Newcastle instead. Despite Alex Ferguson's clear indication to Cole that he was looking for another striker, after the Shearer deal fell through, Cole fought to stay at the club and was handed the number 9 shirt, having previously worn 17. The arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r \u2013 and being the victim of two broken legs suffered after a tackle by Neil Ruddock in a reserve match against Liverpool,[24] restricted Cole's first-team chances further. However, he managed to recover by December 1996 and still played in 20 Premier League matches (ten as a substitute) for the season. Cole then ended the season strongly with several crucial goals in both the league (such as away at title rivals Arsenal), and in the UEFA Champions League (where he scored a goal voted the season's best European goal against Porto) to complete his comeback from injury. Cole then scored the title sealing goal in a landmark 3\u20131 win for United at Anfield \u2013 the scene of his broken legs a few months earlier - as United moved closer to another title triumph.\n\nFor the 1997\u201398 season, the retirement of Eric Cantona saw Cole emerge as first choice striker once again, and he discovered his best form ever for the club. He found himself starting most of United's games that season, either alongside Solskjaer or new signing Teddy Sheringham.\n\nHe became the joint top goalscorer in the Premier League during the course of the season with 18, several of which were spectacular efforts. The most notable was perhaps a chip against Everton, which fans voted as the Manchester United goal of the season. Cole also developed a strong partnership with Teddy Sheringham (despite considerable personal friction between the two), but United finished trophyless for only the second time in the 1990s as they surrendered their lead of the Premier League to Arsenal during the final two months of the season.\n\nCole achieved several personal landmarks in this campaign, scoring his first European hat-trick for the club in an away match at Feyenoord, as well as ending the season as runner-up in the PFA Players' Player of the Year award to Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp. Despite this accreditation, and being the leading goalscorer in all competitions that season with 25, Cole was omitted from England's 1998 FIFA World Cup squad by national coach Glenn Hoddle.[17] Cole remained upbeat when interviewed and when asked about his new-found return to success, he claimed he had found freedom in his life after the injuries and erratic form of his earlier time at Old Trafford, saying he had great joy with his young son and lived for him and his family in his faith as a born-again Christian.[citation needed] He also claimed the friendship of Ryan Giggs, his roommate on away matches, was a major motivating factor through the tough times when fans and media doubted him at United.[citation needed]\n\nCole faced competition from new signing Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r during the 1998\u201399 season, but ended up developing an immensely successful partnership with Yorke. The two contributed 53 goals between them and were rated as one of the most feared attacking partnerships in Europe, with the pair scoring against sides like Barcelona away at the Camp Nou, and repeating the form all season with incredible one-touch passes and assists that at times seemed to demonstrate a telepathic understanding. Although Solskjaer still managed to excel on occasions whether as a starting player or a substitute, and Sheringham also managed to do well and score crucial goals when he played.\n\nCole played a key role in the side's unique treble of the Premier League title, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Cole scored the winning goal in United's final Premier League match of the season against Tottenham Hotspur, a result which meant United finished one point ahead of rivals Arsenal to win the Premier League title. He also scored United's third and winning goal in their Champions League semi-final second leg against Juventus, sealing their place in the final. Also in this season, Cole scored his 100th Premier League goal in a top-of-the-table clash against Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 February; the match ended 1\u20131.\n\nDuring United's pre-season tour of Australia in July 1999, Cole was involved in a horror tackle which left 19-year-old Australian defender Simon Colosimo sidelined for six months and requiring a complete knee reconstruction. Before the injury, Colosimo was one of Australia's best young players and was about to make a big money move to Europe, and was never able to complete a career in Europe, despite a handful of appearances for Manchester City.\n\nCole was United's second top scorer again in 1999\u20132000 with 19 goals in 28 Premier League matches. He collected his fourth Premier League title medal in five seasons, and scored over 20 goals in all competitions for the third successive season. Cole scored many goals for United including the only goal of the game in their top-of-the-table clash against their closest rivals Leeds United. He also joined an elite group during this season by scoring his 100th goal for the club in a 2\u20132 draw against Wimbledon.\n\nAnother title followed in 2000\u201301 when, despite suffering from an injury that restricted his appearances, Cole scored 13 goals in all competitions, including four in the UEFA Champions League, allowing him (at the time) to become Manchester United's record goal scorer in European competition of all time, eclipsing the record set some 30 years earlier by Denis Law.\n\nThe following 2001\u201302 season saw Cole face fresh competition from new signing Ruud van Nistelrooy, as well as Dwight Yorke, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and also Paul Scholes for places up front, with Sir Alex Ferguson adopting a more conservative approach, especially in European matches, by playing Scholes behind Van Nistelrooy with Roy Keane and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n in a three-man midfield. Despite this, Cole managed to score seven goals before leaving for Blackburn Rovers halfway through the season after falling behind to the formidable partnership of Van Nistelrooy and Solskj\u00e6r, meaning that he was often a substitute during the final months of his United career.\n\nMore than five years after his Old Trafford exit, a 35-year-old Cole made one last appearance for Manchester United in the UEFA Celebration Match six years later, on 13 March 2007, coming on at half-time for a friendly match between Manchester United and a European XI, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the European Community and 50 years of Manchester United in the European Cup.\n\nThe arrival of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n counted against Cole's first-team chances in the 2001\u201302 season, and on 29 December 2001, Cole was sold to Blackburn Rovers for \u00a38\u00a0million.[5] Within two months of arriving, he had collected a League Cup winners medal, scoring the winning goal for Blackburn in the final against Tottenham Hotspur, who were managed by the former England manager and open critic of Cole, Glenn Hoddle. This victory meant that, in the space of seven seasons, Cole had won all four domestic trophies plus a European trophy. Cole ended the season with a total of 18 goals in all competitions, 5 for Manchester United and 13 in just 20 matches for Blackburn.\n\nRovers finished sixth the following season and qualified for the UEFA Cup. That campaign saw Cole reunited with Dwight Yorke, who had signed for Blackburn from Manchester United for \u00a32\u00a0million in July 2002.\n\nCole had a frustrating season in 2003\u201304 season, as Rovers slid into the bottom half of the Premier League, finishing 15th. He scored 11 goals but his relationship with manager Graeme Souness hit rock bottom after Cole reported him to the Professional Footballers' Association (\"PFA\") accusing him of unfair treatment. Cole scored 37 goals in 100 appearances in all competitions for Blackburn.[citation needed]\n\nThirteen years after spending a month on loan at Fulham, Cole returned to Craven Cottage for the 2004\u201305 season, joining them on a one-year contract.[25] He was the club's top scorer and scored one of the goals of the season against Liverpool. Despite this successful period at Fulham, he decided to leave the club after only one season as his family wanted to return to the North West.[citation needed]\n\nCole signed for Manchester City on a free transfer at the beginning of the 2005\u201306 season,[26] and enjoyed a good start to his career at Eastlands. Stuart Pearce's side spent most of the season in the top half of the table, but Cole's season was ended by injury in March.\n\nDespite signing a new contract with Manchester City only months earlier[27] and leaving Fulham in 2005 to return to the north, Cole signed for south coast club Portsmouth on transfer deadline day (31 August 2006) for an undisclosed fee, reported as \u00a3500,000 with the potential to rise to \u00a31\u00a0million depending on appearances.[28] He scored his first league goal for his new club in the 2\u20130 win at home to West Ham United on 14 October.[29] However, Cole struggled to break into Harry Redknapp's side and in March 2007, he signed on loan for Birmingham City of the Championship until the end of the season.[30] Cole returned to Portsmouth after five appearances and one goal (against Wolverhampton Wanderers)[31] for Birmingham. He was released on 3 August 2007.[32]\n\nAfter being released by Portsmouth at the end of the 2006\u201307 season, Cole signed a one-year contract with Sunderland on a free transfer, reuniting him once more with former Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers strike partner Dwight Yorke, and under the management of former United teammate Roy Keane. After seven matches for the club, Cole spent three months on loan at Burnley where he scored six goals for the Championship club, including a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road.[33] Reflecting on his time at Turf Moor, Cole stated, \"I went to Burnley and spoke to Owen Coyle and got a great vibe. He brought the best out of me and made me feel a lot younger than my age.\"[34] Cole was released by Sunderland at the end of the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nOn 4 July 2008, Cole signed a 12-month deal with Nottingham Forest, his 12th club and his local from his time growing up in Nottingham. However, on 31 October 2008, Forest confirmed Cole's contract had been cancelled by mutual consent after 11 appearances and 0 goals.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, Cole announced his retirement from football, ending a 19-year career.[35]\n\nDespite first being capped for England in 1995, Cole earned only 15 caps by the time he announced his retirement from international football after failing to be selected for the 2002 World Cup squad. He scored one goal for England, in a World Cup qualifying match against Albania in March 2001.[36] He also scored in his single appearance for the England B team.\n\nGlenn Hoddle, in defence of his decision not to select Cole for the World Cup in 1998, accused Cole of needing six or seven chances to score one goal.[37]\n\nA persistent toe injury in the lead up to UEFA Euro 2000 led to Cole missing out on another major competition for his country.[38][39]\n\nCole earned his first four caps under four different managers. He made his debut against Uruguay under Terry Venables in 1995; appeared next against Italy under Glenn Hoddle at the Tournoi de France in 1997; made his third appearance against France under caretaker Howard Wilkinson in 1999; and finally earned his fourth cap against Poland under new manager Kevin Keegan in his first starting appearance a few weeks later.\n\nIn August 2009, Cole was hired by his former Manchester United and England teammate, Milton Keynes Dons manager Paul Ince, to coach the club's forwards on an initially temporary basis.[40] However, one week later, Cole agreed to spend at least two days a week working on finishing with the forwards at Huddersfield Town, under his former Newcastle United and Fulham teammate Lee Clark.[41]\nIn December 2010, Cole was back at Manchester United, working at the Carrington training ground while finishing his coaching badges.[42]\nIn October 2019, Cole was named as forward and attack coach assisting manager, Sol Campbell at Southend United.[43] On 30 June 2020, manager Campbell and his three assistants including Cole left the club by mutual consent.[44]\n\nIn 1999, Cole signed to WEA/Warner Music and released a cover of the Gap Band's \"Outstanding\" which reached number 68 on the UK Singles Chart.[45]\n\nCole's father, Lincoln, emigrated to the UK from Jamaica in 1957 and worked as a coal miner in Gedling, Nottinghamshire, from 1965 to 1987.[46]\n\nCole married his long-time girlfriend Shirley Dewar in July 2002.[47] Their son, Devante, is also a professional footballer who plays as a forward for Barnsley.\n\nIn 2008, Cole was questioned by police after an alleged assault on his wife at their home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, before being released on bail.[48] Six months later, Cole, through his representative law firm Schillings, won damages in an action against the owners of the Daily Star for defamation regarding the publication of material concerning the assault allegations and for harms caused against his family by sensationalist reports.[47]\n\nIn April 2016, Cole was named in the Panama Papers.[49]\n\nIn June 2014, Cole suffered kidney failure after developing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.[50] In April 2017, he underwent a kidney transplant.[51] His nephew Alexander was the donor.[52]\n\nIn 2000, Cole visited Zimbabwe and returned to set up his own charitable foundation, called the Andy Cole Children's Foundation, which helped AIDS orphans in the country. The charity has since closed down.[53] He has since set up the Andy Cole Fund to raise money for Kidney Research UK, after suffering kidney failure in 2015 after contracting an airborne virus.[54][55]\n\nArsenal\n\nNewcastle United\n\nManchester United\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nIndividual\n\nNeil Ruddock considered Cole to be the player he most enjoyed playing against. In a candid interview with Talksport, he jokingly referred to the incident that resulted in Cole suffering two broken legs in 1997 as \"not big, and not clever\", adding \"but it was great\", and that \"I didn't mean to break both of his legs if I'm honest, I only meant to break one\".[57]\n\nIn 2010, Cole wrote in his column in The Independent he had \"loathed\" and \"pretty much detested\" former Manchester United and England teammate Teddy Sheringham \"for 15 years\" after Sheringham did not offer to shake Cole's hand as Cole was substituted on for Sheringham to make his England debut in a match against Uruguay at Wembley in 1995.[58]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cole"}, {"id": 37, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/66/1302814/original/1302814-photo-u1872523804?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "John Barnes", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/john-barnes/1302814", "desc": "John Charles Bryan Barnes MBE (born 7 November 1963) is an English former professional footballer and manager, who currently works as a commentator and pundit for ESPN and SuperSport.

Often considered one of the greatest English players of all time,[4][5][6] Barnes currently works as an author, as well as a commentator and pundit for ESPN and SuperSport.[7] Initially a quick, skilful left winger, he moved to central midfield later in his career. Barnes won two league titles and two FA Cup finals with Liverpool. He was also an FA Cup runner-up with Watford, Liverpool and Newcastle United. He earned 79 international caps for England.\n\nBarnes was born and raised in Jamaica as the son of a military officer from Trinidad and Tobago and a Jamaican mother. He moved to London, England, with his family when he was 12 years old. He joined Watford aged 17 in 1981, before playing 296 competitive games for them, scoring 85 goals. He debuted for England in 1983, and in 1987 joined Liverpool for \u00a3900,000. In his ten seasons there, Liverpool won the then-top-flight First Division twice and the FA Cup twice. He scored 106 goals in 403 matches. By the time of his last cap, in 1995, he had more caps than any other black England player. After two years at Newcastle United, he ended his playing career at Charlton Athletic in 1999. Barnes had eight months as Celtic head coach when his former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was director of football. He has since managed the Jamaica national team, in 2008\u201309, and English club Tranmere Rovers, for four months in 2009.\n\nBarnes was the PFA Players' Player of the Year once (in 1987\u201388) and the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year twice (in 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390). In 2005, he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame. In 2006, in a poll of Liverpool fans' favourite players, Barnes came fifth; a year later, FourFourTwo magazine named him Liverpool's best all-time player. In 2016, The Times readers voted him England's greatest-ever left-footed player.[8]\n\nBarnes has published two books: John Barnes: The Autobiography (1999), which was followed by The Uncomfortable Truth About Racism (2021), both of which were met with a largely positive reception.[9] In 2022, he returned to Liverpool as an official Club Ambassador.[10]\n\nBarnes was born in Jamaica, to Roderick Kenrick \"Ken\" Barnes (a Trinidadian) and Frances Jeanne Hill (a Jamaican). Ken Barnes hailed from Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago emigrating to Jamaica in 1956 as a member of the West India Regiment. He joined the Jamaica Defence Force when formed after the nation's 1962 independence when he was initially commanding officer of the 1st Battalion Jamaica Regiment. In 1973 he was promoted to colonel remaining in the army until retiring in 1989. While in the army, he was a semi-professional footballer for a Jamaica National Premier League club and also captained the Jamaica national football team.[11][12] Barnes spent his early childhood living in Jamaica's biggest military base,[13] playing football and living a disciplined life. His father was president of the Jamaica Amateur Swimming Association and later formed Jamaica's first bobsleigh team.[12]\n\nBarnes' father was a huge squash and football fan who encouraged his son to pursue sports, having named him after Welsh footballer John Charles.[14] Ken Barnes, who was promoted to Colonel in 1973,[12] was appointed Defence adviser to the High Commission of Jamaica, London (1976\u20131981)[12] and Barnes moved to London with his family in January 1976[15] when he was 12 years old. He attended the rugby-playing St Marylebone Grammar School[16] then a short stint at Haverstock School, Camden Town.[17] While at school he played four years of youth football at the Stowe Boys Club in Paddington.[18]\n\nBarnes was noticed by Watford as a teenager while playing for Middlesex League club Sudbury Court.[19] After a successful trial game in Watford's reserves, Barnes signed on 14 July 1981 for the fee of a set of kits.[20]\n\nBarnes debuted aged 17 as a substitute on 5 September 1981 in a Football League Second Division 1\u20131 home draw with Oldham Athletic. With manager Graham Taylor Watford were eight months away from completing a five-year rise from the Fourth Division to the First.\n\nBarnes quickly established himself as a regular player and scored 12 Second Division goals as Watford were promoted, as runners-up to fierce rivals Luton Town to the top flight of English football at the end of season 1981\u201382. Watford finished runners-up for the League title[21] to Liverpool the season after. Watford lost the 1984 FA Cup Final as under-dogs 2\u20130 to Everton.[22] Watford lost a 1986\u201387 FA Cup semi-final to Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nAt the end of the 1986\u201387 season, Taylor called time on his 10-year spell as Watford manager to take charge at Aston Villa. Bassett, resigned to losing Barnes to a bigger club, gave Alex Ferguson the chance to sign Barnes for Manchester United. Ferguson rejected the offer still having faith in United's left winger Jesper Olsen. Ferguson later admitted that he regretted not signing Barnes, especially as Barnes helped extend Liverpool's dominance in England by three seasons, while Olsen fell out of favour at Old Trafford and had left by the end of 1988, with his successors Ralph Milne and Danny Wallace failing to live up to expectations. Ferguson's United waited until 1990 to win a major trophy and 1993 to win the league title.[23]\n\nBarnes left Watford on 9 June 1987 to sign for Liverpool FC on June 12, 1987 after 233 league appearances scoring 65 goals.\n\nBarnes arrived at Kenny Dalglish's Liverpool in the same close season as England teammate Peter Beardsley and linked up with new signings John Aldridge and Ray Houghton. John Barnes signed for Liverpool FC on June 12, 1987. He debuted for the Reds along with Beardsley on 15 August 1987 in the 2\u20131 league win at Arsenal at Highbury. After 9 minutes Barnes and Beardsley combined to set up Aldridge to score. Barnes' first Liverpool goal was on 12 September beating Oxford United 2\u20130 at Anfield.\n\nIn Barnes' first Liverpool season they won the League title, remaining undefeated for the first 29 games of the season. Barnes' 15 Liverpool league goals in his first season there was second only to John Aldridge. The 2 April 2\u20131 defeat at Nottingham Forest was the last of only two league defeats that season. 11 days later Barnes, Beardsley, Houghton and Aldridge were instrumental in Liverpool's 5\u20130 home win over Forest described by Tom Finney as \"One of the finest exhibition I've seen the whole time I've played and watched the game. You couldn't see it bettered anywhere, not even in Brazil.\"[24][25] The double however was thwarted by Lawrie Sanchez' Wimbledon goal beating Liverpool 1\u20130 in the 1988 FA Cup Final. Barnes was a key performer on the Anfield Rap; the club's cup final song that UK charted at number 3. Barnes was voted PFA Player of the Year.\n\nIn the summer of 1988 Ian Rush re-signed for Liverpool. Following the death of 96 Liverpool fans in April 1989 as a result of the Hillsborough disaster, Barnes attended several funerals and visited the injured in hospital. He pulled out of an England international friendly in order to fulfil these public duties.[26] Liverpool won the 1989 FA Cup Final with a 3\u20132 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton, with Barnes creating goals from the left wing for Rush. In the 1988\u201389 title decider at Anfield, Arsenal's Michael Thomas' 92nd minute, league winning goal occurred in their counter-attack 17 seconds after Barnes lost ball possession attempting to dribble past Kevin Richardson.\n\nBarnes played in the 1990 title winning side at Liverpool and scored 22 league goals from the left wing \u2013 the highest goal tally of his career. Ian Rush scored four fewer league goals than Barnes. Barnes was voted Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year, and expectations from England manager Bobby Robson were also high, seeing Barnes as a key component in the buildup to Italia 90. Teammate Peter Beardsley has since said Barnes at the end of the 1980s was \"The best player I ever played with, bar none. For three or four years at the end of the '80s, John was possibly the best player in the world.\"[27]\n\nBarnes continued to play regularly for Liverpool and England into the 1990s. In 1990\u201391 he scored 16 league goals. Arsenal were league champions in the season of Kenny Dalglish's resignation and his replacement by Graeme Souness as manager. Liverpool had qualified for the 1991\u201392 UEFA Cup, being readmitted to European competitions a year after the ban on all other English clubs in European competitions since the Heysel disaster in 1985 had been lifted. This was the first time Barnes had played in European competitions since Watford's 1983\u201384 UEFA Cup campaign. However, Barnes missed most of the 1991\u201392 season due to a succession of injuries and played just 12 league games, scoring once, as Liverpool finished sixth in the league \u2013 their lowest finish in two decades and the first time since 1981 that they had failed to finish champions or runners-up. Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final but Barnes missed the game through injury. The next month in June he was injured playing for England in Helsinki in a warm up game before Euro 92. Barnes was out injured for five months. He never recovered his explosive burst of speed that had been a key element of his play. He was now past his playing peak.[28]\n\nBarnes and several other senior players had frosty relationships with Souness during this period as the manager tried to impose new methods quickly. Many senior pros resented his hard discipline approach as well as the increased pressure in training.[29] Barnes also once had to make a public apology to Souness after he gave an interview criticising the tactics employed by the manager before an important match.[30] Young teammate Robbie Fowler also said in his autobiography that Souness felt at the time Barnes was past his best, but in Fowler's (and others') opinion he still had a lot to offer and was still one of the most talented players at the club.[31]\n\nSouness later stated in his autobiography that Barnes, due to his injuries, was now taking a \"less demanding\" central midfield playmaker's role as opposed to a goalscoring winger. Despite the effects of the injuries, Barnes was still regarded as one of the club and country's best players and Souness noted that Barnes \"Retained his quality on the ball, using it well and rarely losing possession\".[29] Mark Walters who had played for Souness at Glasgow Rangers had been purchased as cover/competition for Barnes but failed to displace him.\n\nAfter Liverpool's league title in 1990 Liverpool was usurped by Arsenal, Leeds United, Manchester United, and Blackburn Rovers each winning the league at least once. Under Evans, Barnes and younger players like Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler (who had been given their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) won the 1994\u201395 Football League Cup and were 1996 FA Cup Final runners-up due to Eric Cantona's Manchester United goal that gave United a second league and FA Cup double in three seasons. Liverpool's Spice Boys team drew stinging criticism for wearing matching cream Armani suits to the final.[32]\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Barnes had been moved from the left wing to the position of a holding midfielder. He often captained the side in 1995\u201396 when regular captain Ian Rush lost his place to new signing Stan Collymore. When Rush departed to Leeds United at the season's end Barnes became full-time captain. Barnes created the final goal after a dribble and passing movement for Stan Collymore during Liverpool's 4\u20133 win against Newcastle at Anfield, which is often considered the greatest game in Premier League history.[33]\n\nJamie Carragher debuted for the Liverpool first team in January 1997 and said that despite the 33-year-old Barnes now being past his peak, he was still the best player at the club. \"Technically, he's the best player I've ever trained or played with, he was great with both feet, they were both exactly the same. I'd say he's the best finisher I've ever played with (including Torres, Fowler, Owen). Barnes never used to blast his shots \u2013 they'd just get placed right in the corner. You speak with the players from those great Liverpool sides and ask them who the best player they played with was and they all say John Barnes,\" Carragher commented.[34]\n\nOn 13 August 1997 three months before his 34th birthday, after 10 years at Liverpool with 407 appearances, 108 goals, and five major trophies, Barnes left on a free transfer. He had missed just three Premier League games in his final season at Anfield, scoring four goals (including a memorable late winner against Southampton just after Christmas) as they had led the table for much of the first half of the season before being overhauled by eventual champions Manchester United at the end of January and having to settle for a fourth-place finish. Paul Ince, with a completely contrasting combative style, was signed from Inter Milan to replace Barnes in central midfield.[35]\n\nBarnes was subsequently snapped up by former teammate and manager Kenny Dalglish, who was managing Newcastle United. Although an approach had already been made by Harry Redknapp of West Ham, Barnes had agreed in principle to join them, until at the final moment Dalglish called him, and Barnes changed his mind. In the 1997\u201398 season Barnes played up front mostly, deputising for Alan Shearer after Shearer was injured for most of the season, and Barnes ended up Newcastle's top league scorer with six goals, highlighting the Magpies' lack of ability to score in the absence of the injured Shearer, while Ferdinand and Beardsley had both been sold. Former Liverpool colleague Ian Rush and England colleague Stuart Pearce were also drafted in for the 1997\u201398 season. Pearce has since stated in his autobiography, Psycho, that he felt Barnes was overweight by the time he joined Newcastle and that both Barnes and Rush had less desire than himself to win at that stage in their careers as they had already won everything, and that they could have had more of an edge to them.[36]\n\nNewcastle (the previous season's Premier League runners-up) endured a disappointing league campaign and finished 13th, although they did reach the 1998 FA Cup Final, and Barnes went onto the field for the fourth FA Cup final of his career. However, Newcastle lost 2\u20130 to Arsenal, and following the sacking of Dalglish early in the 1998\u201399 season, he was left isolated and shunned along with a number of Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan era players including Rob Lee and Stuart Pearce. Barnes with many others was dropped from the first team by new manager Ruud Gullit and spent several months in the reserves despite, in his opinion, \"excelling in training\" and showing he had lost none of his quality if some of his pace. He felt that himself and others were deliberately being cold shouldered to make it known Gullit wanted his own players in; Barnes had worked briefly with Gullit during the 1998 World Cup ITV commentary team, and they had played numerous international matches played against each other in the 1980s and 1990s, but they were not friends. Barnes knew it was the last straw when even his MBE from the Queen was overlooked by Gullit after a presentation had been given to Stuart Pearce for receiving one \u2013 this was in the winter of 1998 and he knew he was unwanted.[35] Barnes left the club on a free transfer to newly promoted Charlton on 10 February 1999.\n\nBarnes made his debut for Charlton on 13 February 1999, coming on as a substitute in a 1\u20130 home win over Liverpool.[37] He made a further 11 league appearances that season, mostly as a substitute, and did not score any goals.[37] Defeat on the final day of the season relegated the Addicks back to Division One, and Barnes announced his retirement as a player after 20 years.\n\nDuring his short spell as Celtic manager, Barnes would later register as a player, although he did not make an appearance for the Scottish side.[37]\n\nDuring his playing career, Barnes (like other Black players of his era) was frequently the target of racial abuse from the terraces. At one of his first appearances at Anfield, Barnes said that the tea lady had, intentionally or unintentionally, served tea to all the players in the lounge except him, and he made a joke about it by asking light-heartedly, \"Is it because I'm Black?\"[35] As well as being abused by opposition players, on occasions Barnes reported overhearing teammates making racist remarks towards other black players in opposition teams. One instance of racial abuse by a section of Everton supporters in the Merseyside derby at Anfield led to Everton chairman Philip Carter disowning the offending supporters, branding them \"scum\". The highest profile racial incident of his career was captured in a photograph where Barnes, in full Liverpool kit and mid-match, casually backheeled away a banana which had been hurled at him during a match with Everton at Goodison Park.[38]\n\nAlthough born in Jamaica, Barnes had no intention of representing Jamaica at international level as the \"Reggae Boyz had not yet made a significant mark on world football and he was eager to get to the game's biggest stage\".[39]\n\nAt the time of Barnes' international career, FIFA's national team eligibility criteria allowed British passport holders to represent one of the British football associations if they had no blood ties to the United Kingdom. Barnes had already planned to represent England where he had lived since the age of 12.[40] Barnes said: \"the only reason I played for England was because they were the first to ask...if Scotland had asked [first]...You go and play for Scotland.\"[39]\n\nBarnes debuted for Bobby Robson's England on 28 May 1983 as a second-half substitute for Watford teammate Luther Blissett in a 0\u20130 at Northern Ireland's Windsor Park in the British Championship.[41] Blissett was the fifth and Barnes the seventh black full England football internationalists.\n\nEngland failed to qualify for the 1984 European Championships, so instead toured South America. On 10 June 1984 Barnes v Brazil dribbled through several Brazilian defenders and rounded Roberto Costa to score in a friendly match at Rio de Janeiro's Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3.[citation needed]\n\nIt was after the World Cup that Barnes became a British passport holder. Speaking in 2008, Barnes said \"I don't even know if the English F.A. didn't know that I wasn't born there and wasn't brought up there...maybe I played (for England) illegally, right?\"[39]\n\nIn his early England days, he and fellow black player Mark Chamberlain were subjected to threats from racist groups. Barnes was abused by supporters of the National Front on the plane back from South America in June 1984; with the group claiming that England had only won 1\u20130 against Brazil because Barnes' goal \"didn't count\".[citation needed]\n\nBobby Robson did not use Barnes at the 1986 World Cup until the quarter final with 15 minutes left when trailing 2\u20130 against Argentina.[41] (BBC commentator Barry Davies shouted: \"Go on! Run at them!\" when Barnes was given the ball), setting up a goal for Gary Lineker and laying on another chance denied by the head of Lineker's Argentine marker. England were eliminated with Barnes praised for his contribution and many asked why he had not played more nor in previous games. He then became a regular starter for England at both the 1988 European Championships and 1990 World Cup.[41]\n\nAs part of a front four with Gary Lineker, Peter Beardsley, and Chris Waddle, England lost all three of their group games at the 1988 European Championships. However, Robson stayed in his job.\n\nBarnes pulled out of England's first international game after the Hillsborough disaster due to grief he felt at the time.[citation needed] In his absence, England won the World Cup qualifier against Albania 5\u20130 at Wembley on 26 April 1989.[42]\n\nIn the Football World Cup 1990 lead up, Barnes played several times as a forward alongside Gary Lineker, and in a warm up game against Uruguay played well and scored a half volley from a Stuart Pearce cross. Barnes again rapped this time in New Order's UK Number 1, \"World in Motion\", tie-in song.\n\nAt the 1990 World Cup he injured his groin against Belgium shortly after his volleyed goal was wrongly disallowed for offside. England went out to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final.\n\nIn June 1992 v Finland in Helsinki in England's last warm up game before the 1992 European Championships, he tore his achilles tendon. He was injured for five months. In his absence England were eliminated at the group phase. On his return he had lost his explosive burst of speed and was now past his peak.[28]\n\nIn a Wembley 1994 World Cup qualifier against San Marino, Barnes was booed by an entire section of England fans after the whole team played poorly. Barnes later believed an article attributed to Jimmy Greaves in the Daily Mirror, which cited his supposed support for the West Indies cricket team and questioned his loyalty to the England team, had influenced the crowd to boo.[35]\n\nHe earned a surprise England recall in 1994 under Terry Venables and was in the squad in the run up to Euro '96 after improved form for Liverpool, although he was not selected for the final tournament squad despite England not having an established left-sided alternative.\n\nBarnes' 79 caps (11 goals) made him England's record capped black player for a time. Compared to his club form, he was never seen as a player who peaked wearing an England shirt. Bobby Robson described him as the \"Greatest enigma\" of his career; whilst including him for his all time dream team England squad of all the players he had picked as manager in his 1990 book \"Against All Odds\" (placing him on the bench), he was baffled at Barnes's inconsistency. He described Barnes as being a player of \"the highest calibre\" but sometimes being unable to reach for that bit extra when he or Captain Bryan Robson shouted at him to take more players on.[35]\n\nBarnes has since said he felt the systems England played were \"rigid\" focusing on speed, aggression, and attacking through the centre rather than patient, passing play. He also said he could receive the ball as few as six or seven times in a game whereas at Liverpool he may receive it more than twenty times, and he had more freedom under Kenny Dalglish who did not ask him to stay on the left wing all the time. England also had a very different system to Liverpool at the time, who were much more free-flowing, and later said that to have got the best out of him, they would have needed a similar system to the one used by Dalglish, which was never likely to happen. He also cited Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle as players he felt England were unable to get the best out of.[35]\n\nNewspapers at the time of his England career even queried whether his disciplinarian upbringing in Jamaica to a military family and rumoured beatings as a child from his parents had contributed to his underperformance as an England footballer.[35]\n\nAfter 12 years Barnes won his 79th and last cap on 6 September 1995 in a 0\u20130 friendly draw with Colombia at Wembley that contained extrovert Colombian goalkeeper Ren\u00e9 Higuita's 'Scorpion Kick.'[43] Barnes was in the top ten most capped players list for eleven years until David Beckham and then Gary Neville edged him from ninth to 11th.\n\nIn 1999, Tony Adams picked Barnes to be in his England dream team in his book Addicted, citing that Barnes \"could pass, move, dribble, had Brazilian style movement... what more could you want?\" He also backed Barnes's view that England at times used rigid systems.[44]\n\nIn a \"dream ticket\" style move, Barnes was appointed head coach of Celtic on 8 June 1999 working under Kenny Dalglish as director of football. After his appointment he later re-registered himself as a player but never played a competitive game for Celtic. He was sacked 8 months into his tenure following a home 3\u20131 1999\u20132000 Scottish Cup defeat by lower division Inverness Caledonian Thistle in February. The result led to the newspaper headline, \"Super Caley go ballistic, Celtic are atrocious\". Kenny Dalglish took over first-team duties until the end of the season.[45] Although Dalglish won the League Cup in the process, his contract was not renewed and the board decided to replace him with Martin O'Neill.\n\nBarnes entered discussions with the Jamaica Football Federation in September 2008 regarding the possibility of him managing the Jamaica national team.[46] On 16 September 2008, Barnes was appointed as manager of Jamaica announcing Mike Commane as his assistant. Barnes guided his new Jamaican charges to a first-place finish in the 2008 Caribbean Championships, qualifying as the top Caribbean side for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nIn February 2009, Barnes told Sky Sports that he wanted to return to club management if the opportunity arose.[47] It was reported in May 2009 that Barnes contacted English League Two side Port Vale to see whether he could replace out-going manager Dean Glover.[48] Ultimately, though, the potential move to Port Vale did not happen. Instead, on 14 June 2009 he confirmed that he was to be appointed manager of League One side Tranmere Rovers.\n\nBarnes was officially named as manager of Tranmere Rovers on 15 June 2009, with Jason McAteer assisting him.[49] He got off to a disastrous start, with Tranmere only winning three of their first fourteen games. On 9 October 2009, Barnes was sacked by the club six days after a 5\u20130 defeat at Millwall and a run of just two wins from eleven league games.[50]\n\nFormer England international Tom Finney remarked that \"players like John Barnes come along just once in a lifetime.\"[51] Twice in his career, Barnes was voted Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year. He also won the PFA Players' Player of the Year. Although he is widely regarded as among the most underperforming players, when compared to his club form, to wear an England shirt, Barnes was voted England's \"greatest left foot\" by readers of The Times in 2016, ahead of Chris Waddle and Jimmy Greaves.[8] Barnes was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to the English game.\n\nThe Liverpool fans\u2019 adoration for \"Digger\" (he was nicknamed after the character Digger Barnes in the American soap opera Dallas)[52] was emphasised when he finished in the top 5 of the poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop which was conducted by the official Liverpool Football Club web site in the summer of 2006. More than 110,000 supporters worldwide voted for their 10 favourite players of all time, Barnes finished 5th behind Robbie Fowler (4th), Ian Rush (3rd), Steven Gerrard (2nd) and the man that signed him three times (for Liverpool, Newcastle and Celtic) Kenny Dalglish (1st).[53]\n\nHe also appears frequently as a selection in FourFourTwo magazine's Perfect XI, a choice in which current and former professional footballers select the best 11 players they have ever seen, played with or against, including selections by Michael Owen, Steve McManaman, Peter Beardsley, Ian Wright and Jamie Carragher.[54]\n\nHe performed the Keith Allen-penned rap section of New Order's \"World in Motion\" as well as appearing on the track \"Anfield Rap\", a Liverpool FC FA Cup Final song, rapping the lyrics \"Liverpool FC is hard as hell/ United, Tottenham, Arsenal\",[55] and performing lead rap in Liverpool's '96 cup final song \"Pass & Move (It's the Liverpool Groove)\".\n\n\"World in Motion\" reached #1 in the charts and spent 18 weeks in the UK top 75 (including re-releases in 2002 and 2010) although Barnes was only paid a flat rate of \u00a3200 and received no royalties.[56] \"Anfield Rap\" reached #3 and spent 6 weeks in the top 75, and \"Pass & Move\" reached #4 and spent 4 weeks in the top 75.\n\nThe rap portion of \"World in Motion\" is the most remembered part of the original song, becoming an iconic piece of English football culture in its own right, familiar to subsequent generations of England football fans not even born in 1990.[57]\n\nBarnes was first married to and subsequently divorced Suzy, with whom he has two sons and two daughters. Barnes' second wife is called Andrea and they have two daughters and a son.\n\nWith fellow former footballers Les Ferdinand and Luther Blissett, he founded Team48 Motorsport, a team aiming to promote young racing drivers of African-Caribbean background. In 2008, the team entered the British Touring Car Championship, running Alfa Romeos for white Jamaican Matthew Gore and 18-year-old black Briton Darelle Wilson. However, the project never got off the starting line and the team failed to show up for any of the races.\n\nA few days after being sacked by Tranmere, Barnes was declared bankrupt. He has described the bankruptcy as a technicality, saying: \"The bankruptcy issue is a tax oversight which is being dealt with.\"[58][59] Barnes' claims of the bankruptcy being a \"tax oversight\" proved true and the order was quickly overturned.[60]\n\nAs a sporting icon in England in the early 1990s Barnes appeared in a commercial for the energy drink Lucozade, launching their Lucozade Sport drink.[61] Barnes became a pundit on ITV and a presenter of the football coverage on Five as well as having his own weekly football discussion show on LFC TV called The John Barnes Show, every Thursday. He also worked as an ambassador for Save the Children. Barnes has appeared on several shows and media outlets to promote his charity work, including a notable appearance on Soccer AM in February 2009 performing the \"World in Motion\" rap and a parody of the mistimed advert by ITV in the previous week's Everton vs. Liverpool FA Cup tie, with Barnes' \"Under-11 World Champion Baton-twirling\" routine missed by mock commercials.[62][63][64] In 2001, Barnes appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank.[65]\n\nIn 2000, Barnes presented a one off soccer special with Lisa Rogers entitled The Pepsi World Challenge, devised and produced by Nathan Carey and airing on Channel 5 in the UK. The show was edited with local presenters around the world.[citation needed]\n\nHe was the subject of a This is Your Life programme in 2001, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel.[citation needed]\n\nBarnes competed in the fifth series of Strictly Come Dancing which started in October 2007. His dance partner was Nicole Cutler. They finished in seventh place. He was also the first male celebrity to receive a ten from the judges, which he got for his salsa.\n\nAfter an absence of nearly eight years, Barnes returned to football in late 2007. He agreed to run several coaching clinics across the Caribbean for young players with the possibility of them joining Premier League side Sunderland on trial.[66]\n\nHe made a guest appearance as himself in episode 10 of Series 6 of Waterloo Road that was aired on BBC One on Wednesday, 27 October 2010.[citation needed]\n\nHe has been used as a pundit in ESPN's coverage of the FA Cup 2010, and in SuperSport's coverage of the UEFA Champions League 2010\u20132011, in South Africa.\n\nHe appeared on Russell Howard's Good News best bits show on Thursday, 15 December 2011, as his Mystery Guest. In the show he was dressed as Santa Claus and along with Russell Howard he performed his famous rap from New Order's \"World in Motion\".[citation needed]\n\nOn 17 October 2012, Barnes featured in series 9, episode 9 of the BBC series Who Do You Think You Are?.[67]\n\nBarnes has suggested the American National Football League's Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview minority candidates for coaching positions, should be adopted by the Premier League.[68]\n\nIn 2016 in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, Barnes refuted Michael Gove's claim that he wished the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, clarifying that he supports continued UK membership of the EU.[69]\n\nIn January 2018, Barnes participated as a housemate on the twenty-first series of Celebrity Big Brother.[70]\n\nOn 21 February 2019, Barnes was a guest on Question Time, commenting on racism and discrimination in society.[71]\n\nLiverpool\n\nJamaica\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barnes_(footballer)"}, {"id": 38, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/48/952290/original/ernie-barnes-football-players-american--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Ernie Barnes", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/ernie-barnes/952290", "desc": "Ernest Eugene Barnes Jr. (July 15, 1938 \u2013 April 27, 2009) was an American artist, well known for his unique style of elongation and movement.  He was also a professional football player, actor and author.", "full_desc": "\n\nErnest Eugene Barnes Jr. (July 15, 1938 \u2013 April 27, 2009) was an American artist, well known for his unique style of elongated characters and movement.  He was also a professional football player, actor and author.\n\nErnest Barnes Jr. was born during the Jim Crow era in \"the bottom\" community of Durham, North Carolina, near the Hayti District of the city. He had a younger brother named James (b. 1942), as well as a half-brother, Benjamin B. Rogers Jr. (1920\u20131970). Ernest Jr. was nicknamed \"June\". His father, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. (\n\u20131966), worked as a shipping clerk for Liggett Myers Tobacco Company. His mother, Fannie Mae Geer (1905\u20132004), oversaw the household staff for a prominent Durham attorney and local Board of Education member, Frank L. Fuller Jr.\n\nOn days when Fannie allowed \"June\" (Barnes's nickname to family and childhood friends) to accompany her to work, Mr. Fuller encouraged him to peruse the art books and listen to classical music. The young Ernest was intrigued and captivated by the works of master artists. By the time Barnes entered the first grade, he was familiar with the works of such masters as Toulouse-Lautrec, Delacroix, Rubens and Michelangelo. When he entered junior high school, he could appreciate, as well as decode, many of the cherished masterpieces within the walls of mainstream museums \u2013 although it would be many more years before he was allowed entrance because of segregation.[1]\n\nA self-described chubby and unathletic child, Barnes was taunted and bullied by classmates. He continually sought refuge in his sketchbooks, finding the less-traveled parts of campus away from other students. One day Ernest was drawing in his notebook in a quiet area of the school. He was discovered hiding there by the masonry teacher, Tommy Tucker, who was also the weightlifting coach and a former athlete. He was intrigued with Barnes's drawings, so he asked the aspiring artist about his grades and goals. Tucker shared his own experience of how bodybuilding improved his strength and outlook on life. That one encounter would begin Barnes's discipline and dedication that would permeate his life. In his senior year at Hillside High School, Barnes became the captain of the football team and state champion in the shot put.[2]\n\nBarnes attended racially segregated schools. In 1956 he graduated from Hillside High School with 26 athletic scholarship offers. Segregation prevented him from attending nearby Duke University or the University of North Carolina. His mother promised him a car if he lived at home so he attended the all-Black North Carolina College at Durham (formerly North Carolina College for Negroes, now North Carolina Central University). At North Carolina College he majored in art on a full athletic scholarship. His track coach was Dr. Leroy T. Walker.[1] Barnes played the football positions of tackle and center at NCC.\n\nAt age 18, on a college art class field trip to the newly desegregated North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, Barnes inquired where he could find \"paintings by Negro artists\". The docent responded, \"Your people don't express themselves that way\".[3] 23 years later, in 1979, when Barnes returned to the museum for a solo exhibition, North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt attended.\n\nIn 1990 Barnes was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by North Carolina Central University.[4]\n\nIn 1999 Barnes was bestowed \"The University Award\", the highest honor by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors.[4]\n\nIn December 1959 Barnes was drafted in the tenth round by the then-World Champion Baltimore Colts.  He was originally selected in the eighth round by the Washington Redskins,[5] who renounced the pick minutes after discovering he was a Negro.\n\nShortly after his twenty-second birthday, while at the Colts' training camp, Barnes was interviewed by N. P. Clark, sportswriter for the Baltimore News-Post newspaper.  Until then Barnes was always known by his birth name, Ernest Barnes.  But when Clark's article appeared on July 20, 1960, it referred to him as \"Ernie Barnes,\" which changed his name and life forever.[6]\n\nBarnes was the last cut of the Colts' training camp.  After Baltimore released Barnes, the newly formed Titans of New York immediately signed him because the team had first option on any player released within the league.[5]\n\nBarnes loathed being on the Titans.  He said, \"[The New York team organization] was a circus of ineptitude. The equipment was poor, the coaches not as knowledgeable as the ones in Baltimore. We were like a group of guys in the neighborhood who said let's pretend we're pros.\"[5]\n\nAfter their seventh game on October 9, 1960 at Jeppesen Stadium, his teammate Howard Glenn died.  Barnes asked for his release two days later.  The cause of Glenn's death was reported as a broken neck.  However, Barnes and other teammates have long attributed it to heatstroke.[1]  In a later interview, Barnes said, \"They never really said what he died of.  (Coach) Sammy Baugh said he'd broken his neck in a game the Sunday before.  But how could that be?  How could he have hit in practice all week with a broken neck?  What he died of, I think, was more like heat exhaustion.  I told them I didn't want to play on a team like this.\"[5]\n\n\nBarnes decided to accept a previous offer from Coach Al Davis at the Los Angeles Chargers.  Barnes joined their team at mid-season as a member of their taxi squad.  The following season in 1961 the team moved to San Diego.  It was there Barnes met teammate Jack Kemp, and the two men would share a very close lifelong friendship. \nDuring the off-seasons with the Chargers, Barnes was program director at San Diego's Southeast YMCA working with parolees from the California Youth Authority.[1]  He also worked as the sports editor for The Voice, a local San Diego newspaper, writing a weekly column called \"A Matter of Sports.\"[7]\n\nBarnes also illustrated several articles for San Diego Magazine during the off-seasons in 1962 and 1963.[8][9]\n\nBarnes's first television interview as a professional football player and artist was in 1962 on The Regis Philbin Show on KGTV in San Diego.  It was Philbin's first talk show.  They would see each other again 45 years later when Philbin attended the tribute to Barnes in New York City.\n\nMidway through Barnes's second season with the Chargers, he was cut after a series of injuries.  He was then signed to the Denver Broncos.\n\nBarnes was often fined by Denver Coach Jack Faulkner when caught sketching during team meetings.[1]  One of the sketches that he was fined $100 for sold years later for $1000.[10]\n\nMany times during breaks, Barnes would run off the field onto the sideline to give his offensive line coach Red Miller the scraps of paper of his sketches and notes.\n\n\"During a timeout you've got nothing to do \u2013 you're not talking \u2013 you're just trying to breathe, mostly.  Nothing to take out that little pencil and write down what you saw.  The shape of the linemen.  The body language a defensive lineman would occupy\u00a0... his posture\u00a0...  What I see when you pull.  The reaction of the defense to your movement.  The awareness of the lines within the movement, the pattern within the lines, the rhythm of movement.  A couple of notes to me would denote an action\u00a0... an image that I could instantly recreate in my mind.  Some of those notes have been made into paintings.  Quite a few, really.\"[11]\n\nOn Barnes's 1964 Denver Broncos Topps football card he is shown wearing jersey #55 although he never played in that number.  His jersey was #62.\n\nBarnes was called \"Big Rembrandt\" by his Denver teammates.[12]  Coincidentally, Barnes and Rembrandt share the same birthday.\n\nIn 1965, after his second season with the Broncos, Barnes signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders in Canada.  In the final quarter of their last exhibition game, Barnes fractured his right foot, effectively ending his professional football career.\n\nShortly after his final football game, Barnes went to the 1965 NFL owners meeting in Houston in hopes of becoming the league's official artist.  There he was introduced to New York Jets owner Sonny Werblin, who was intrigued by Barnes and his art.  He paid for Barnes to bring his paintings to New York City.  Later they met at a gallery and unbeknownst to Barnes, three art critics were there to evaluate his paintings.  They told Werblin that Barnes was \"the most expressive painter of sports since George Bellows.\"[1]\n\nIn what was one of the most unusual posts in the history of the NFL, Werblin retained Barnes as a salaried player, but positioned him in front of the canvas, rather than on the football field. Werblin told Barnes, \"You have more value to the country as an artist than as a football player.\"[13]\n\nBarnes's November 1966 debut solo exhibition, hosted by Werblin at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City, was critically acclaimed and all the paintings sold.[14][15]\n\nIn 1971 Barnes wrote a series of essays (illustrated with his own drawings) in the Gridiron newspaper titled \"I Hate the Game I Love\" (with Neil Amdur).[16]  These articles became the beginning manuscript of his autobiography, later-published in 1995 titled From Pads to Palette which chronicles his transition from professional football to his art career.\n\nIn 1993 Barnes was selected to the \"Black College Football 100th Year All-Time Team\" by the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.\n\nBarnes credits his college art instructor Ed Wilson for laying the foundation for his development as an artist.[17]  Wilson was a sculptor who instructed Barnes to paint from his own life experiences.  \"He made me conscious of the fact that the artist who is useful to America is one who studies his own life and records it through the medium of art, manners and customs of his own experiences.\"[18]\n\nAll his life, Barnes was ambivalent about his football experience.  In interviews and in personal appearances, Barnes said he hated the violence and the physical torment of the sport.  However, his years as an athlete gave him unique, in-depth observations.  \"(Wilson) told me to pay attention to what my body felt like in movement.  Within that elongation, there's a feeling.  And attitude and expression. I hate to think had I not played sports what my work would look like.\"[19]\n\nBarnes sold his first painting \"Slow Dance\" at age 21 in 1959 for $90 to Boston Celtic Sam Jones.[1]  It was subsequently lost in a fire at Jones' home.\n\nNumerous artists have been influenced by Barnes's art and unique style. Accordingly, several copyright infringement lawsuits have been settled and are currently pending.\n\nErnie Barnes framed his paintings with distressed wood in homage to his father. In his 1995 autobiography, Barnes wrote of his father: \"... with so little education, he had worked so hard for us. His legacy to me was his effort, and that was plenty. He knew absolutely nothing about art.\"[1]\n\nWeeks before Ernie Barnes's first solo art exhibition in 1966, he was at the family home in Durham as his father lay in the hospital after suffering a stroke. He noticed the usually well-maintained white picketed fence had gone untended since his father's illness. Days later, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. died. \"I placed a painting against the fence and stood away and had a look. I was startled at the marriage between the old wood fence and the painting. It was perfect. In tribute, Daddy's fence would hug all my paintings in a prestigious New York gallery. That would have made him smile.\"[1]\n\nOne of his most notable art works that takes on this framing style is titled \"Screen Door\", which was a work in progress piece from 2007. It is a scene viewed through an open door. \"The large vertical painting depicts a man and women embracing. Her back is to the viewer. Green painted and weathered wood frames the image in the manner of a wooden screen door, complete with handle.\"[20]\n\nA consistent and distinct feature in Barnes's work is the closed eyes of his subjects.\n\nIt was in 1971 when I conceived the idea of The Beauty of the Ghetto as an exhibition. And I showed it to some people who were Black to get a reaction. And from one (person) it was very negative. And when I began to express my points of view (to this) professional man, he resisted the notion. And as a result of his comments and his attitude I began to see, observe, how blind we are to one another's humanity. Blinded by a lot of things that have, perhaps, initiated feelings in that light. We don't see into the depths of our interconnection. The gifts, the strength and potential within other human beings. We stop at color quite often. So one of the things we have to be aware of is who we are in order to have the capacity to like others. But when you cannot visualize the offerings of another human being you're obviously not looking at the human being with open eyes.[21]\n\n\"We look upon each other and decide immediately: This person is black, so he must be\u00a0... This person lives in poverty, so he must be\u00a0...\".[11]\n\nMoving to an all-Jewish neighborhood in Los Angeles known as the Fairfax District in 1971 was a major turning point in Barnes's life and art.\n\nFairfax enlivened me to everyday life themes \u2026 and forced me to look at my life \u2013 the way I had grown up, the customs within my community versus the customs in the Jewish community. Their customs were documented, ours were not. Because we were so clueless that our own culture had value and because of the phrase \"Black is Beautiful\" had just come into fashion, Black people were just starting to appreciate themselves as a people. But when it was said, \"I'm Black and I'm Proud,\" I said, \"proud of what?\" And that question of \"proud of what\" led to a series of paintings that became \"The Beauty of the Ghetto\".\n\nIn response to the 1960s \"Black is beautiful\" cultural movement and James Brown's 1968 \"Say it Loud: I'm Black and I'm Proud\" song, Barnes created The Beauty of the Ghetto exhibition of 35 paintings that toured major American cities from 1972 to 1979 hosted by dignitaries, professional athletes and celebrities.\n\nOf this exhibition, Barnes said, \"I am providing a pictorial background for an understanding into the aesthetics of black America.  It is not a plea to people to continue to live there (in the ghetto) but for those who feel trapped, it is\u00a0... a challenge of how beautiful life can be.\"[22]\n\nWhen the exhibition was on view in 1974 at the Museum of African Art in Washington, DC, Rep. John Conyers stressed the important positive message of the exhibit in the Congressional Record.\n\nBarnes created many styles of athletic pieces of art that weren't just football related. These pieces would capture sports such as hockey, boxing, tennis, basketball, and gymnastics[20]\n\nThe Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee named Barnes \"Sports Artist of the 1984 Olympic Games\".  LAOOC President Peter V. Ueberroth said Barnes and his art \"captured the essence of the Olympics\" and \"portray the city's ethnic diversity, the power and emotion of sports competition, the singleness of purpose and hopes that go into the making of athletes the world over.\" Barnes was commissioned to create five Olympic-themed paintings and serve as an official Olympic spokesman to encourage inner city youth.[23][24]\n\n1985:  Barnes was named the first \"Sports Artist of the Year\" by the United States Sports Academy.[10]\n\n1987:  Barnes created Fastbreak, a commissioned painting of the World Champion Los Angeles Lakers basketball team that included Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Kurt Rambis and Michael Cooper.\n\n1996: Carolina Panthers football team owners Rosalind and Jerry Richardson (Barnes's former Colts teammate) commissioned Barnes to create the large painting Victory in Overtime (approximately 7\u00a0ft. x 14\u00a0ft.).  It was unveiled before the team's 1996 inaugural season and hangs permanently in the owner's suite at the stadium.  Richardson and Barnes were Baltimore Colts teammates briefly in 1960.\n\n1996:  To commemorate their 50th anniversary in 1996, the National Basketball Association commissioned Barnes to create a painting with the theme, \"Where we were, where we are, and where we are going.\"  The painting, The Dream Unfolds hangs in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts.  A limited edition of lithographs were made, with the first 50 prints going to each of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. \n\n2004:  Barnes was named \"America's Best Painter of Sports\" by the American Sport Art Museum & Archives.[25]\n\nOther notable sports commissions include paintings for the New Orleans Saints, Oakland Raiders and Boston Patriots football team owners.[26]\n\nShortly after Barnes was drafted by the Baltimore Colts, Barnes was invited to see their Colts' NFL Championship Game vs. the New York Giants at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore on December 27, 1959.  The Colts won 31\u201316 and Barnes was filled with layers of emotion after watching the game from the Colts' bench.  At age 21, he had just signed his football contract and met his new teammates Johnny Unitas, Jim Parker, Lenny Moore, Art Donovan, Gino Marchetti, Alan Ameche and \"Big Daddy\" Lipscomb.\n\nAfter he returned home, without making any preliminary sketches, he went directly to a blank canvas to record his point of view.  Using a palette knife, \"painting in quick, direct movements hoping to capture the vision\u00a0... before it evaporated,\" Barnes said, he created \"The Bench\" in less than an hour.[1]  Throughout his life, The Bench remained in Barnes's possession, even taking it with him to all his football training camps and hiding it under his bed. It would be the only painting Barnes would never sell, despite many substantial offers, including a $25,000 bid at his first show in 1966.\n\nIn 2014, Barnes's wife Bernie presented The Bench painting to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for their permanent collection in Canton, Ohio.\n\nBarnes created the painting The Sugar Shack in 1971.  It gained international exposure when it was used on the Good Times television series and on the 1976 Marvin Gaye album I Want You. \n\nAccording to Barnes, he had created the original version of The Sugar Shack after reflecting upon his childhood, during which he was not \"able to go to a dance.\"[27]  In a 2008 interview, Barnes said, \"The Sugar Shack is a recall of a childhood experience. It was the first time my innocence met with the sins of dance. The painting transmits rhythm so the experience is re-created in the person viewing it. To show that African-Americans utilize rhythm as a way of resolving physical tension.\"[28]\n\nThe Sugar Shack has been known to art critics for embodying the style of art composition known as \"Black Romantic,\" which, according to Natalie Hopkinson of The Washington Post, is the \"visual-art equivalent of the Chitlin' circuit.\"[29]\n\nWhen Barnes first created The Sugar Shack, he included his hometown radio station WSRC on a banner.  (He incorrectly listed the frequency as 620, though it was actually 1410.  Barnes confused what he used to hear WSRC's on-air personality Norfley Whitted saying \"620 on your dial\" when Whitted was at his former station WDNC in the early 1950s.)\n\nAfter Marvin Gaye asked him for permission to use the painting as an album cover, Barnes then augmented the painting by adding references that allude to Gaye's album, including banners hanging from the ceiling to promote the album's singles.[29][30]\n\nDuring the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever anniversary television special on March 25, 1983, tribute was paid to The Sugar Shack with a dance interpretation of the painting.\n\nThe original piece is currently owned by Eddie Murphy, and is on display at his home in Beverly Park, California. A duplicate created by Barnes was created in 1976 on display at the California African American Museum (CAAM).[31] The duplicate was sold at Christie's on May 12, 2022 to American businessman Bill Perkins, who paid $15.3 million for the work.[32][33]\n\nBarnes's work appears on the following album covers: \n\n\n1971: \"Barnes organized a touring exhibition of 35 paintings with the purpose of defining how black is beautiful, giving the black community  a sense of pride a sense of community.\" From 1972 to 1979, \"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" traveled to major U.S. cities, where his celebrity supporters and local elected officials hosted the shows and new collectors from across the country were introduced to his work.\"[20]\n1992:  In the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Mayor Tom Bradley used Barnes's painting Growth Through Limits as an inspirational billboard in the inner-city.  Barnes contributed $1,000 to the winner of a slogan contest among the city's junior high school students that best represented the painting.[34][35]\n\n1995:  Barnes's work was included in the traveling group exhibition 20th Century Masterworks of African-American Artists II.[36]\n\n1998:  Barnes's painting The Advocate was donated to the North Carolina Central University School of Law by a private collector.[37]  Barnes felt compelled to create the painting from his \"concern with the just application of the law\u00a0... the integrity of the legal process for all people, but especially those without resource or influence.\"[38]\n\n2001:  While watching the tragic events of 9/11, Barnes created the painting In Remembrance.  It was formally unveiled at the Seattle Art Museum.  It was later acquired on behalf of the City of Philadelphia and donated to its African American Museum.  A limited number of gicl\u00e9e prints were sold with 100% of the proceeds going to the Hero Scholarship Fund, which provides college tuition and expenses to children of Pennsylvania police and fire personnel killed in the line of duty.[39]\n\n2005:  Three of Barnes's original paintings were exhibited at London's Whitechapel Gallery in the 2005 Back to Black: Art, Cinema & Racial Imaginary art exhibition.[40]\n\n2005: Kanye West commissioned Barnes to create a painting to depict his life-changing experience following his near-fatal car crash.  A Life Restored measures 9\u00a0ft. x 10\u00a0ft.  In the center of the painting is a large angel reaching out to a much smaller figure of West.[41]\n\nOctober 2007:  Barnes's final public exhibition.  The National Football League and Time Warner sponsored A Tribute to Artist and NFL Alumni Ernie Barnes in New York City.\n\nAt the time of his passing, Barnes had been working on an exhibition Liberating Humanity From Within which featured a majority of paintings he created in the last few years of his life.[42]\n\n2016: Barnes' painting \"Willies' Barbershop\" was part of an exhibit about afro-natural hair pioneer Willie Morrow at the Museum at California Center for the Arts, Escondido.[43][44]\n\nBarnes appeared on a 1967 episode of the game show To Tell the Truth. The panelists correctly guessed Barnes was the professional football player-turned-artist.\n\nBarnes played Deke Coleman in the 1969 motion picture Number One, which stars Charlton Heston and Jessica Walter. Barnes played Dr. Penfield in the 1971 movie Doctors' Wives, which starred Dyan Cannon, Richard Crenna, Gene Hackman and Carroll O'Connor.\n\nIn 1971 Barnes, along with Mike Henry, created the Super Comedy Bowl, a variety show CBS television special which showcased pro athletes with celebrities such as John Wayne, Frank Gifford, Alex Karras, Joe Namath, Jack Lemmon, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett and Tony Curtis. A second special aired in 1972.[45][46][47]\n\nThroughout the Good Times television series (1974\u201379) most of the paintings by the character J.J. are works by Ernie Barnes. However a few images, including \"Black Jesus\" in the first season (1974), were not painted by Barnes. The Sugar Shack made its debut on the show's fourth season (1976\u201377) during the opening and closing credits.  In the fifth season (1977\u201378) The Sugar Shack was only used in the closing credits for five early episodes during that season. In the sixth season (1978\u201379), The Sugar Shack was only used in opening credits for the first eight episodes and in the closing credits for five early episodes during that season. In the fifth and sixth seasons (1977\u201379), The Sugar Shack appears in the background of the Evans family apartment. Barnes had a bit part on two episodes of Good Times: The Houseguest (February 18, 1975) and Sweet Daddy Williams (January 20, 1976).\n\nBarnes's artwork was also used on many television series, including Columbo, The White Shadow, Dream On, The Hughleys, The Wayans Bros., Wife Swap, and Soul Food, and in the movies Drumline and Boyz n the Hood.\n\nIn 1981 Barnes played baseball catcher Josh Gibson of the Negro leagues in the television movie Don't Look Back: The Story of Leroy 'Satchel' Paige with Lou Gossett Jr. playing Paige.\n\nThe 2016 film Southside with You (about Barack and Michelle Obama's first date) prominently features Barnes's work in an early scene where the two characters visit an art exhibition.[48][49]\n\nBarnes passed away on Monday evening, April 27, 2009, at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, California, from myeloid leukemia.[50]  He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in two places: at his hometown Durham, North Carolina, near the site of where his family home once stood, and at the beach in Carmel, California, one of his favorite cities.\n\nErnie Barnes was recognized as a main honoree by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, North Carolina, on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed on 29 individuals \"whose dedication, accomplishments and passion have helped shape Durham in important ways.\"[51]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Barnes"}, {"id": 39, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/477/9532606/original/peter-burgstaller-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Peter Burgstaller", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/peter-burgstaller/9532606", "desc": "Peter Burgstaller (13 February 1964 \u2013 23 November 2007) was an Austrian football goalkeeper.", "full_desc": "Peter Burgstaller (13 February 1964 \u2013 23 November 2007) was an Austrian football goalkeeper.\n\nHe played for Favoritner AC (until 1984), Wacker Innsbruck (1984\u20131986), Grazer AK (1986\u20131987), VfB M\u00f6dling (1987\u20131988), Austria Salzburg (1988\u20131991), SV Ried (1991\u20131992) and finally a second spell at Austria Salzburg before retiring from the game in 1993.\n\nAfter retiring from the game, Burgstaller coached lower division side FC Puch during the 1995\u201396 season, and later founded an event agency in Salzburg.\n\nBurgstaller was shot and killed on a golf course in Durban, South Africa on 23 November 2007.[1] Police suspect the murder was the result of a robbery, as Burgstaller's mobile phone and golfing equipment were missing at the scene of the crime.

John Bentley Reid (1843\u20131910) and Sibyl Rose Reid, n\u00e9e Drury (1849\u20131943).[2] He was born in Swan Hill, Victoria on 12 July 1872, and was one of their five sons and two daughters.[3][4]\n\nThe Reids had arrived in Australia in 1871 on the Hampshire, and moved straight to Swan Hill, Victoria where Rev. John Reid became its first Presbyterian minister. He was ordained as soon as Swan Hill's first Presbyterian Church, The John Knox Church, was completed in December 1872.[5]\n\nAfter spending some time in Victoria Rev. John Bentley Reid moved to Western Australia. He was the joint minister of both the Leederville and the Subiaco Presbyterian churches in 1899.[6] He died on 10 August 1910, in Victoria, aged 68.[7]\n\nHe attended Caulfield Grammar School, Scotch College, and the University of Melbourne, where he was a resident of Ormond College.[8]\n\nHe graduated from Melbourne University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1896.[9]\n\nAs well as playing football whilst he was at Scotch College[10] \u2014 he played for the Scotch College First XVIII in both 1889 and 1890[11] \u2014 he also played cricket.[12] In a match against Wesley College in 1888, he took 7 wickets for 16 runs in the first innings.[13]\n\nHe also competed in, and came second in the open age pole vault and the running high jump at the Scotch College School Sports in 1888.[14]\n\nIn 1893 and 1894, whilst attending Melbourne University, he participated in a number of lawn tennis tournaments. He won the high jump championship at the 1897 Melbourne University sports meeting, representing the Arts faculty, with a jump of 5\u00a0ft. 5in; was captain of the Ormond rugby team[15] and, also, came second in the 120 yards hurdles championship race.[16]\n\nReid made his debut for Victorian Football Association (VFA) team Fitzroy, as a backman, on Saturday 9 June 1894, at the Richmond Cricket Ground. It was Fitzroy's seventh game for the 1894 season, and Fitzroy won 10 goals 7 behinds to Richmond's 3 goals 11 behinds.[17]\n\nIn its match report The Argus commented that \"The Fitzroy captain [viz., Tom Banks] was immensely pleased with the high marking of Reid, a former Scotch College boy\".[18] In its report, The Age, noting that \"it was his first game in the maroons' ranks\", and that \"he is a decided acquisition to the team\", remarked that \"Reid, among the backs, played almost perfect football throughout\".[19]\n\nHe played a number of senior VFA games for Fitzroy between 1894 and 1896,[20] and came to be considered as one of the game's best defenders.[21]\n\nBy the start of 1897, when the Fitzroy Football Club left the VFA and took part in the inaugural VFL competition, Reid was already well established as a defender,[22] and had gained a reputation for his strength, his high making and his long kicking.[23][24]\n\nHe played a total of 24 senior Victorian Football League (VFL) games; eight in 1897,[25] and sixteen in 1898.[26]\n\nIn his first VFL match, at the Brunswick Street Oval, on Saturday 29 May 1897, Reid played an outstanding defensive game \u2014 \"Reid was playing a sure and fast game\";[27] \"Reid marked beautifully and invariably got in a splendid long low kick\"[28] \u2014 in a team that was unexpectedly very soundly beaten by a very inexperienced Essendon side, 6.6 (42) to 2.8 (20); the three-quarter time score had been 5.5 (35) to 1.3 (9).[29]\n\nIn June 1897, in the first season of the new V.F.L. competition, the Victorian Football League arranged a match between a combined team of V.F.L. players and a combined team from what was, perhaps, the second strongest competition in Australia at that time, the Ballarat Football Association.[30] Whilst the selected team was listed as \"Melbourne\", and the match spoken of as the Ballarat v. Melbourne match, all of the contemporary newspaper accounts indicate that most people referred to them as \"The Metropolitans\" (by contrast with the \"Country\" team from Ballarat). There is no record of the team ever being referred to as either the \"Victorian\" team or the \"V.F.L.\" team.\n\nThe representative match was originally proposed to take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday, 12 June 1897; however, for some trivial reasons, relating to the question of the free admission of V.F.L. delegates to the Members' Reserves,[31] the Melbourne Cricket Club refused to allow the V.F.L. to use its pavilion facilities, and the V.F.L. decided well before the match to transfer the game to the Brunswick Street Oval in North Fitzroy.[32]\n\nReid was not selected in the original team, which contained players from Melbourne, Essendon, South Melbourne, Fitzroy, Geelong, Carlton and St Kilda.[33] However, for reasons that were never made quite clear, six of the selected twenty players, Firth McCallum and Henry Young from the Geelong Football Club, Bill McCulloch from the Melbourne Football Club, and Jim Anderson, George Vautin and Harry Wright all of the Essendon Football Club failed to turn up for the match.\n\nThe match did not start on time, and there was a rush to find last minute replacements. Eventually, Ernie Walton from the Carlton Football Club, Joe O'Grady from the St Kilda Football Club, and Tom Banks, Bill Cleary, Bill McSpeerin, and Stan Reid, all from the Fitzroy Football Club took the field in place of the absentees in the Metropolitan team.[34] Thus, Stan Reid played for the first combined Victorian Football League side that ever played in metropolitan Melbourne \u2013 earlier in that same week, a far weaker combined V.F.L.  team had travelled to Bendigo, and played a combined team there, winning the match 14.14 (98) to 9.4 (58).[35]\n\nReid was injured early in the game, was unable to continue, and left the field;[36] which, according to the rules of the day, which allowed for twenty \"run on\" players for each team with no replacements, left his team one man short (he was, however, fit enough by the following Saturday to play for Fitzroy against South Melbourne). Another of the Metropolitan team, Norm Waugh, from the Essendon Football Club, was very badly concussed during the match; he remained on the field for the whole match, but was of no help to his team-mates at all.\n\nThe well trained and highly skilled Ballarat team beat the VFL side \u2013 no doubt because the VFL team had not trained together, had the six last minute replacements, played as separate, selfish individuals, and effectively played two men short  \u2014 by a score of 13.11 (89) to 8.6 (54).[31]\n\nHis last game for Fitzroy was in the 1898 VFL Grand Final, on Saturday, 24 September 1898, at the Junction Oval,[37] the first ever VFL Grand Final Match.\n\nSelected on the full-back line,[38] he played a strong game and was one of Fitzroy's best players.[39]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026Mr. T. Banks then presented on behalf of the\nFitzroy Football Club, Mr. Stanley Reid with a very\nuseful travelling companion and pair of field glasses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr Banks commented on the good the game\nreceived from gentlemen of the position of Mr. Reid\nin playing football.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The club was sorry to lose Mr. Reid, and he was\ncarrying to West Australia their best wishes for his\nfuture welfare.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Reid made a very feeling speech in reply,\nhe stated that he thoroughly loved the game and\nalthough he was donning the clerical robes, he\nwould still feel an interest in the sport and would\nalways look for Fitzroy's welfare. (Cheers).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fitzroy City Press, 20 October 1898.\n\nOnce in Western Australia, he continued to play football; he played for one of the local teams, the Boulder City Rovers.[41]\n\nAlthough stationed on the West Australian goldfields, Reid kept in touch with his old team. On Monday 1 April 1901, at the annual meeting of the Fitzroy Football Club held at the Fitzroy Town Hall, prizes were awarded to Mick Grace and Ern Jenkins for having been the most \"consistent\" players in the 1900 season.\n\nThe prizes had been donated by the Rev. Stanley S. Reid of Boulder, and the West Australian dental surgeon, Edgar Henry McGillicuddy.[42]\n\nBecause Melbourne University was a secular institution in the nineteenth century, it did not offer degrees in Divinity.[43]\n\nConsequently, Reid had to pursue his theological studies at the separate Presbyterian theological college that was situated on the university's campus, Ormond College, graduating at the end of 1898.[44],[45] Whilst he was at Ormond College he was also captain of the College's football team.[46]\n\nHe was ordained as the first minister to the newly formed St. George's Presbyterian Church in the Western Australian gold mining town of Boulder on 15 March 1899,[47] having arrived there in December 1898.[48]\n\nOn Monday 5 June 1899, as a mark of the high esteem with which he was already held by the congregation (and the citizens of Boulder in general), the ladies of St George's Presbyterian Church presented Reid with a silk gown. At the same gathering, presided over by the Mayor of Boulder, Mr. John M. Hopkins, Reid was also presented with an illuminated address to mark the auspicious occasion.[49]\n\nWhilst still in Victoria, Reid had served for 18 months[50] as a member of the self-funded voluntary citizens' military force known as the Victorian Mounted Rifles. The men were required to supply and maintain their own horse, and supply their own uniform, rifle, saddles, harness, and all other equipment. They were trained in various cavalry activities, such as marksmanship and both mounted and dismounted parade drills.[51]\n\nReid was a highly skilled horseman. More than a year after leaving Victoria and taking up his post at Boulder in Western Australia, he was still able to produce a good performance. He competed in the \"Military Sports\" division of the four-day carnival arranged to aid the St George's Presbyterian Church in Boulder.[52] Reid competed in the tilting at the ring without success, came second in the tent pegging competition, came third in the umbrella and cigar race,[53] came second in his heat of the rescue race, and won his first bout in the horseback wrestling only to lose his second bout to a much heavier and stronger opponent.[54]\n\nSoon after the Second Boer War had broken out in October 1899, Reid volunteered to serve as a chaplain to the Second Contingent of the Western Australian Mounted Infantry. His offer to serve as a chaplain was not successful because there were no vacant positions at the time of his application.[55]\n\nHe eventually enlisted as a private in the Second Western Australian (Mounted Infantry) Contingent (2WAMI)[56] which left Australia on 3 February 1900.[57]\n\nOn Wednesday, 26 December 1899, Reid was given a special farewell by the town council and residents of Boulder.\n\nIn his response to the toasts, he said that whilst \"he had got over the youthful glamor of war\" he was also totally \"prepared to take his part in what was in store for him\" in South Africa. He added that he hoped that, if he returned, those present \"would be able to say that they had given a farewell to a man who had taken his part for the British Empire\". He also stressed that his enlistment had been thought out at some length and was not the consequence of a momentary whim, remarking that \"to outsiders\u2026 it might seem peculiar for a clergyman to join as a common soldier\"; however, in his view, \"when the time and opportunity offered\u2026 every man should act patriotically as well as talk patriotism\", and that \"[although] there might be questions as to the beginning of the war\" it was clear that, \"now that it had started they should all unite to see it through. (Loud applause.)\"[58]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BOULDER CLERGYMAN VOLUNTEERS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0KALGOORLIE, 27 December\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rev. Stanley Reid, Presbyterian minister at the Boulder, left this afternoon by the express to join the West Australian contingent for the Transvaal. Last night he was accorded a hearty send-off by friends and church communicants. As the train moved away he was accorded ringing cheers. Mr. Reid, who was in the first flight of Melbourne athletes, has joined the contingent as a private.[59]\nHe was a popular soldier and he was well respected for his military skills by his fellow troopers.[60]\n\nThe contingent (consisting of 6 officers, 97 other ranks, 125 horses, one spring cart, and one wagon[61]) left Australia on the SS Surrey on 3 February 1900. Immediately the West Australian contingent arrived in South Africa it was attached to the 11th Division of the South Africa Field Force, commanded by Lieutenant-General Reginald Pole-Carew. On 25 July 1900, as the division began its advance to Komatipoort on the Komati River, at the frontier between Mozambique and South Africa, Reid became separated from his Division, and was listed as \"missing\" for twelve days. He rejoined his Division at Middelburg.[62] The Division eventually reached Komatipoort on 24 September.[44]\n\nDuring this first tour of duty, Reid had seen action in Johannesburg, Diamond Hill, Belfast, Cape Colony, and Orange Free State.[63]\n\nDuring this time Reid had written a letter from Middelburg, dated 22 August 1900, to his mother in Perth.\n\nIn his letter he was highly critical of a senior officer. Although he did not name him in the letter to his mother, the officer was later identified as one \"Sergeant Robinson\", who had been promoted to \"Captain Robinson\". Consequent upon matters connected with the Bush Veldt Carbineers and \"the Handcock-Morant military scandal\" Robinson was relieved of his command, and reduced to \"Corporal Robinson\", thus effectively exonerating Reid, and verifying that his privately expressed views were reliable.[64] The West Australian newspaper obtained the letter from his mother, and noting that \"this letter gives an account of his experiences during a very anxious time\" (viz., the time that he was missing), published it on 11 October 1900,[65] without seeking Reid's permission to do so.\n\nAs soon as the military authorities in South Africa became aware of the letter's publication, Reid was arrested and repatriated to Australia (he reached Fremantle, along with the rest of the Second Western Australian (Mounted Infantry) Contingent, on 8 December 1900).[66]\n\nHaving returned to Australia under arrest, Reid had the reasonable expectation that he would be court-martialled. However, no official investigation of any kind was ever made into the circumstances of the publication of the letter; and, for some undisclosed reason, his case was unexpectedly dropped altogether.[67]\n\nIn the absence of any \"official\" explanation, is reasonable to suppose that one or more of several possible influences may have played a part in the decision of the authorities not to proceed against Reid:\n\nHaving been released from custody, and having been selected as one of the 25 returned soldiers to represent the State of Western Australia at the celebrations held in Sydney to celebrate the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901,[72] Reid was promoted to Lieutenant on 7 March 1901,[73] and he joined the Sixth Western Australian (Mounted Infantry) Contingent in camp at Karrakatta.[67],[74]\n\nHis younger brother, Surgeon-Captain Francis Bentley Reid,[75] was medical officer to the same unit.\n\nThe entire contingent left Western Australia on 10 April 1901 on the S.S. Ulstermore. Reid made a speech at the quayside and a presentation of a purse of sovereigns to the W.C.T.U. on behalf of the members of the contingent who had received their support at Karrakatta.[76] The contingent arrived in South Africa on 29 April 1901.[67]\n\nReid's unit saw action in Eastern Transvaal; and, on 16 May 1901, Reid was badly wounded in the stomach in a heavy fire fight at a farm near Brakpan.[77] Reid was taken to a field hospital 39 miles from Carolina.[67] Both Reid and his brother were mentioned in despatches for their bravery at this time:[78]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lieutenant S S Reid at [Brakapan]\u2026 remained with his men though severely wounded early in the fight\u2026\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Surgeon-Captain F B Reid showed absolute disregard of danger in performing his duties on the same occasion\".[79]\nReid recovered from his stomach wound and returned to action with his unit.[80] In 1902, Mr. Collick,[81] a military chaplain, reported that when he had gone up to the wounded Reid (Collick had been riding in company with Dr. Francis Reid) and told him that he would call an ambulance, pointing to the two wounded men by his side, Reid had responded \"Don't mind me; see to these fellows\".[82] Collick also remarked that, he was one of the bravest officers in South Africa; and that, although \"Reid's wound was serious enough to get him three months' leave of absence\", he insisted on returning to action immediately he had recovered sufficiently and leading his men.[83]\n\nOn 23 June 1901, during a reconnaissance at Renshoogte Farm, near Ermelo,[84] Reid was once again shot in the stomach. His brother placed Reid and the other wounded in an ambulance cart and set off back to their camp.\n\nIn a letter to their parents, written after Reid's death, his brother described his wounding:[85]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[On 23 June], as soon as it was light enough to march, the Fifth and Sixth W.A.M.I. and Imperial Light Horse, with two Colt guns, left camp to reconnoitre the surrounding country, as the Boer snipers had been giving a lot of annoyance on the previous day. On a kopje about three miles from camp we lodged the guns in a position in which they had command on all sides within a range of about 3,000 yards. From the kopje we advanced, the Fifth on the left and the Sixth in the centre, and on the right we advanced two and a half miles from the guns to some kaffir kraals, where we halted, while Stanley was further ahead with his troops in skirmishing order to see what was over the sky-line which was about three miles away from us. They advanced slowly, and when they were near the sky-line we heard heavy firing going on. Stanley and his troops disappeared from view behind a ridge, and the rifle firing became very heavy and continuous in their direction. Then we saw about twenty mounted men appear from the ridge over which his troops had disappeared from view. We took them to be our men returning until they came within 300 yards or so. Then we discovered they were Boers chasing two of Stanley's men. We opened fire on them and drove them back. Then these two men told us that of Stanley's troops' two men were killed and three wounded, the rest being taken prisoners. In the meantime the 5in. gun had been sent for and taken into position alongside the Colt guns. These now commenced firing on the enemy for a while at a range of about five miles. After they finished my orderly and myself rode across with the Red Cross flag, to the scene of the troops' engagement. There we found two dead and three wounded \u2013 Stanley through the stomach, his sergeant in three places, through the neck, through the leg, and through his lungs; and a private through the chest. We at once dressed Stanley's wounds, and made him as comfortable as it was possible, the men of ours doing all they could to make him comfortable, taking off half their own clothes to make a bed for him and to cover him. In about an hour and a half the ambulance waggon came, and we took them all back to camp. Major Jones, who is in charge of the hospital, has done everything to make him comfortable.\nThree days later, on the morning of 29 June 1901, Reid died of his wounds at Middel-Kraal: his brother described the circumstances in his letter to their parents:[86]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stanley died [on the morning of 29 June] at 5 o'clock. Since he was wounded I have been near him all the time, and was with him when he passed away. I had all the surgeons in the camp. but they all agreed it was hopeless. He was in considerable pain, but stood it as I have seldom seen a man stand it. The men of the contingent fairly worshipped him; and are very cut up over his death. Poor Stanley's grave is the best I have seen in South Africa. The men asked leave from the captain to look after the grave. Leave was granted, and they worked away at it and made it up splendidly.\nHe was buried in a grave especially arranged by the men he had commanded \u2013 situated beneath a clump of Australian wattles, with a large wooden cross bearing his name at its head \u2013 with full military honours in a ceremony, attended by his commanding officer Colonel Campbell and his staff, representatives of all of the regiments comprising the Sixth W.A.M.I., conducted by regimental chaplain and Reid's old friend, Mr. Collick.[87]\n\nA fellow officer, Lieutenant Bernard Bardwell, reported that \"His brother, the doctor, was almost mad with grief. It will take a strong hand to pull him together again, as he is utterly broken down, poor fellow.\"[88]\n\nIn 1902, Mr. Collick praised Reid, stating that \"though Stanley Reid went to South Africa as a soldier he lived up to the high standard of life that he would have had to live as a minister, and in every way he set a good example to his men.[83]\n\nReid, the second VFL player known to have died in active service,[89] is buried at the Middelburg Cemetery, Mpumalanga.[90]\n\nAt probate, in April 1902, his estate was worth \u00a3200.[91]\n\nThe West Australian of 21 May 1901, noting that Reid \"was for some time the minister of the Presbyterian Church at Boulder\", reported that \"he was regarded as a fine soldier, and one who had a more than ordinary moral influence over his comrades in the field\".[92]\n\nIn its 20 July 1901 tribute to Reid, The Western Mail, having made reference to his academic and clerical careers, reported that Field Marshal Lord Roberts, the Commander in Chief of the British Forces in Second Boer War, had said of Reid: \"He is one of the best men on the field of battle\".[93][94]\n\nAt the same time the newspaper observed that \"his death has caused sorrow in many a home\", and reported that a memorial service had been held in Boulder on Sunday 14 July 1901 for the town's former Presbyterian minister and that \"many Roman Catholics and people of other denominations [had] attended to show their respect to the memory of one who had proved himself a man among men\".[94] The Kalgoorlie Western Argus also published an obituary.[95]\n\nAfter his death his commanding Officer wrote to his mother:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both officers and men under my command feel acutely the loss of your gallant son who by his kindliness and manly bearing had endeared himself to everybody with whom he was associated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His conduct in the field was most exemplary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During our engagement at Breakpan [sic] he was severely wounded in the stomach, but not withstanding the severity of his wound he continued in action, and led his division until the close of the action.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For his conspicuous bravery I mentioned him in despatches, and to the general commanding this column was pleased to forward it on to the commander in chief.[96]\nIn a match against Trinity College on Tuesday, 9 July 1901, not long after the news of Reid's death had reached Melbourne, the Ormond College football team all wore black arm-bands as a mark of respect for their former captain.[46]\n\nReid was specifically mentioned in the address given by Sir James George Steere, the chairman of the W.A. Fallen Soldiers' Memorial Committee, on Friday 26 July 1901 in Kings Park, when Steere formally invited the Duke of York (later King George V) to lay the foundation stone for the monument that was to serve as a memorial to the 4 officers and 24 men (of the more than 900 that went to South Africa in six different contingents from Western Australia) who were killed in action or died of their wounds in the Boer War.[97]\n\nStanley Spencer Reid is commemorated on war memorials at:[94]\n\nReid's personal diary and a collection of letters that were written by Reid whilst on active service in South Africa are held by the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.[100]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Reid"}, {"id": 41, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/66/1314175/original/john-salthouse-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "John Salthouse", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/john-salthouse/1314175", "desc": "John Salthouse (born John Lewis on 16 June 1951) is a British actor and producer.

As footballer he played for Corinthians in several different positions including goalkeeper and centre forward, although his preferred position was wing-half. He made one appearance for the England national team in 1925 when he was appointed team captain. As a cricketer he played for Cambridge University and Essex. A pre-war officer of the Auxiliary Air Force, he died as a result of a mid-air collision in a training accident in the Second World War.\n\nAshton was born in Calcutta, India and was the youngest of four sons of Hubert Shorrock Ashton and of Victoria Alexandrina Ashton (n\u00e9e Inglis). Ashton's mother, Victoria, was the daughter of Sir John Eardley Wilmot Inglis, who commanded the British forces at the Siege of Lucknow, and Julia Selina Thesiger.[1]\n\nHis brothers included Hubert, Gilbert and Percy, all of whom played first-class cricket.\nClaude was educated at Winchester College where he was captain of cricket, football, racquets and fives. He then went up to Trinity College, Cambridge and earned his blue at hockey, cricket and football. When Claude Ashton and his two brothers, Hubert and Gilbert, were together in the Cambridge football team of 1920, the university side earned itself the nickname of \"Ashton Villa\".[2] Although he became football captain in his third year at University, he was unable to take part in the 1923 match against Oxford University.\n\nAshton first played for the University Cricket eleven in May 1921, and in 1921 he made 557 runs for the university at an average of 46.41. His best scores were 101 not out off the Surrey bowlers at the Oval[3] and with 98 against M.C.C. at Lord's.[4] In the match against Oxford University in July, he played alongside his brothers Gilbert (captain) and Hubert making 48 runs (with Hubert scoring 118) as Cambridge won by an innings and 24 runs.[5]\n\nAfter the varsity match, Claude joined Hubert at Essex with only modest success, scoring 240 at an average of 18.46. With one appearance for the England XI against Australia, his aggregate for the season was 798 at an average of 29.55.\n\nIn July 1922, he again joined Hubert (now captain) in the varsity match which was won by an innings and 100 runs, after Hubert (on 90) (with Percy Chapman on 102) declared at 403 for four wickets. As a result, Claude was unable to bat and only bowled three overs without claiming a wicket.[6] Rain interfered with many matches in 1922 but Claude's aggregate for the university and Essex for the year was 797 runs, average 28.46. His best performance came in early August against Middlesex, when he scored 110 not out in a drawn match.\n\nFor 1923, he succeeded his two elder brothers as captain of Cambridge University, but was unable to emulate his brothers in the varsity match. Oxford batted all the first day, and during the night a severe thunderstorm with a deluge of rain completely altered the conditions at Lord's, with the result that Cambridge were dismissed twice and beaten on the Tuesday by an innings and 227 runs, the most overwhelming defeat in the whole series of university matches and the three most decisive results to occur consecutively.[7] Claude thus ended his time with the university in rather dismal circumstances.\n\nIn the 1923 season as a whole, however, he amassed 916 runs at an average of 24.75, and claimed 50 wickets with his medium-pace bowling, together with 21 catches.\n\nOver the next few years, his business commitments restricted his cricket and between 1930 and 1933 he played no first-class cricket. After a five-year absence from first-class cricket, he returned for Essex at the end of May 1934 in a match against Kent at Brentwood. In an astonishing match Kent scored 803 for four wickets, with Bill Ashdown scoring 332, Frank Woolley 172 and Les Ames 202 n.o. (185 runs were scored off Ashton's 31 overs). In reply, Essex managed 408 in the first innings, with centuries from Dudley Pope and Jack O'Connor, while Ashton could only contribute 11. Following on, Essex were bowled out for 203, with Ashton making 71 not out.[8]\n\nA few days later, he made his highest first-class score of 118 against Surrey (again at Brentwood), helping O'Connor put on 287 for the fifth wicket, a then Essex record, in a total of 570, which brought victory by an innings and 192.[9] The stand occupied only two hours twenty minutes, and the fourth hundred of the innings came in 38 minutes.[10] The combined total of runs scored in these two matches was 2362. In six games for Essex in 1934, Ashton scored 416 runs and headed the averages with 59.42.\n\nHis fourth and final century came against Gloucestershire in July 1936, when he scored 100 in a drawn match, thereby passing a career total of 4500 runs.[11]\n\nHis first-class cricket career spanned 18 years from 1921 to 1938 during which he scored an aggregate of 4723 runs at an average of 24.98, took 139 wickets as a bowler, and held 113 catches.\n\nAt Cambridge University, he became football captain in his third year, but unable to take part in the 1923 match against Oxford University. After graduating, he played for Old Wykehamists, and he, Hubert and Gilbert occupied the inside-forward positions for Old Wykehamists in Arthur Dunn Cup ties.\n\nWhilst at university, he joined his two brothers at Corinthian, making his first appearance on 18 December 1920 playing at wing-half in a 4\u20132 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion. In the next match, against the Isthmian League, he played at inside left alongside his two brothers. Over the next two seasons he generally played as a forward, before reverting to left-half in 1923\u201324, occasionally dropping back into defence. On 29 November 1924 he played in goal against Oxford University deputising for Benjamin Howard Baker.\n\nFor the 1925\u201326 season, he was restored to the forward line with great success. Over the next five seasons, he scored 103 goals from 89 appearances, including five goals against Northern Nomads on 24 December 1927, United Hospitals on 20 October 1928 and The Army on 19 January 1929. He played for the \"Amateurs\" in the 1929 FA Charity Shield.[12] In 1932 he dropped back into midfield and ended his career with the Corinthians in November 1934.\n\nHis final appearance for Corinthian came in an FA Cup first round tie against Watford on 24 November 1934, which was lost 2\u20130. In his fifteen seasons with Corinthian, he appeared in all 20 FA Cup ties played by Corinthian, scoring seven goals including a pair against Walsall on 8 January 1927 and a hat-trick in a 5\u20130 victory at Norwich City in the third round on 12 January 1929. His first goal against Norwich came at thirty minutes when he scored with a drive, following a pass from Jackie Hegan. He increased the lead two minutes before the break after a cross from Hegan, when he \"proceeded to slot the ball gently past the surprised goalkeeper\". His third goal came near the end of the game when he ran through to complete his hat-trick.[13] He also scored Corinthian's consolation goal in a 3\u20131 defeat by Newcastle United at Crystal Palace in front of a crowd of 56,338 on 29 January 1927.[14]\n\nIn his career with Corinthian, he played a total of 208 matches, only exceeded by Tommy Whewell and Benjamin Howard Baker, and scored 145 goals.\n\nHe was selected for the England national team for the match against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park, Belfast on 24 October 1925, and was appointed captain for his solitary appearance for the full national side, playing at centre-forward. He did not have a particularly memorable game, failing to \"give cohesion to his line and his shooting was weak\".[15] He was generally considered to be a good tackler and dribbler, but weak in the air. The game ended in a 0\u20130 draw.[16] He was the last player to captain England in his only international.[17]\n\nHe also made 12 appearances for the England Amateur XI.\n\nWhilst at Cambridge, he twice played hockey against Oxford.[9] After retiring from football, he joined the Beckenham hockey club and was given a trial for England.\n\nOn graduating from Cambridge University, he qualified as a Chartered Accountant, and later worked in the London Stock Exchange.\n\nHe was married to Isabel Norman-Butler and had three children. His wife's sister was married to George Abell who played cricket for Worcestershire and Oxford University.\n\nHe was commissioned as an acting pilot officer in No. 909 (County of Essex) (Balloon) Squadron, Auxiliary Air Force on 5 July 1938,[18] he was promoted to flying officer later that year.[19] He was called to active service at the outbreak of the Second World War, and was promoted flight lieutenant on 18 September 1939.[20] On 25 February 1942 he transferred to the General Duties Branch for flight training, reverting to the rank of flying officer.[21] He was posted in rank of squadron leader to No. 256 Squadron RAF and was killed on 31 October 1942,[22] when as a navigator/observer flying in a Bristol Beaufighter X7845 it collided in mid-air with a Vickers Wellington during a training mission near Caernarfon, North Wales. The pilot of his Beaufighter was Squadron Leader Roger Winlaw, a fellow Old Wykehamist who had played 52 games for Cambridge and Surrey.

As a player, he won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973 and 1974.[4] Cruyff was a proponent of the football philosophy known as Total Football explored by Rinus Michels. Generally regarded as one of the most influential figures in modern football, he is considered as both one of the best players and greatest managers in the history of the sport.[5][6][7][8][9]\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dutch football rose from a semi-professional and obscure level to become a powerhouse in the sport.[10][11] Cruyff led the Netherlands to the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup with three goals and three assists; he received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.[12][13] After finishing third in UEFA Euro 1976, Cruyff refused to play in the 1978 FIFA World Cup after a kidnapping attempt targeting him and his family in their Barcelona home dissuaded him from football.[14] At club level, Cruyff started his career at Ajax, where he won eight Eredivisie titles, three European Cups, and one Intercontinental Cup, where he had two assists in the final.[15][16]  In 329 matches for Ajax, he scored 257 goals and provided more than 170 assists. In 1973, he moved to Barcelona for a world record transfer fee, helping the team win La Liga in his first season and winning the Ballon d'Or. In 180 official matches for Barcelona, he scored 60 goals and provided 83 assists.[17] After retiring from playing in 1984, Cruyff became highly successful as manager of Ajax and later Barcelona; he remained an advisor to both clubs after his coaching tenures. His son Jordi also played football professionally for Barcelona.\n\nIn 1999, Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, and came second behind Pel\u00e9 in their World Player of the Century poll.[18] He came third in a vote organised by the French magazine France Football consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect their Football Player of the Century.[19] He was included in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, and in 2004 was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[20]\n\nI was born shortly after the war, though, and was taught not to just accept anything.\n\n\u2014Cruyff said in a documentary on TV3 channel (2015).[21]\n\nHendrik Johannes \"Johan\" Cruyff was born on 25 April 1947 in the Burgerziekenhuis hospital in Amsterdam. He grew up on a street five minutes away from Ajax's stadium, his first football club. Johan was the second son of Hermanus Cornelis Cruijff and Petronella Bernarda Draaijer, from a humble, working-class background in east Amsterdam. Cruyff, encouraged by his influential football-loving father and his close proximity in Akkerstraat Stadium, played football with his schoolmates and older brother, Henny, whenever he could, and idolised the prolific Dutch dribbler, Faas Wilkes.\n\nIn 1959, Cruyff's father died from a heart attack. His father's death had a major impact on his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, \"My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept stronger over me that I would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.\"[22] Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats.[23] His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.[24]\n\nCruyff joined the Ajax youth system on his tenth birthday. Cruyff and his friends would frequently visit a \"playground\" in their neighbourhood and Ajax youth coach Jany van der Veen, who lived close by, noticed Cruyff's talent and decided to offer him a place at Ajax without a formal trial.[23] When he first joined Ajax, Cruyff preferred baseball and continued to play the sport until age fifteen when he quit at the urging of his coaches.[25]\n\nHe made his first team debut on 15 November 1964 in the Eredivisie, against GVAV, scoring the only goal for Ajax in a 3\u20131 defeat. That year, Ajax finished in their lowest position since the establishment of professional football, in 13th.[26] Cruyff really started to make an impression in the 1965\u201366 season and established himself as a regular first team player after scoring two goals against DWS in the Olympic stadium on 24 October 1965 in a 2\u20130 victory. In the seven games that winter, he scored eight times and in March 1966 scored the first three goals in a league game against Telstar in a 6\u20132 win. Four days later, in a cup game against Veendam in a 7\u20130 win, he scored four goals. In total that season, Cruyff scored 25 goals in 23 games, and Ajax won the league championship.[12]\n\nIn the 1966\u201367 season, Ajax again won the league championship, and also won the KNVB Cup, for Cruyff's first \"double\".[12] Cruyff ended the season as the leading goalscorer in the Eredivisie with 33. Cruyff won the league for the third successive year in the 1967\u201368 season. He was also named Dutch footballer of the year for the second successive time, a feat he repeated in 1969.[12] On 28 May 1969, Cruyff played in his first European Cup final against Milan, but the Italians won 4\u20131.\n\nIn the 1969\u201370 season, Cruyff won his second league and cup \"double\"; at the beginning of the 1970\u201371 season, he suffered a groin injury. He made his comeback on 30 October 1970 against PSV, and rather than wear his usual number 9, which was in use by Gerrie M\u00fchren, he instead used number 14.[12] Ajax won 1\u20130. Although it was very uncommon in those days for the starters of a game not to play with numbers 1 to 11, from that moment onwards, Cruyff wore number 14, even with the Dutch national team. There was a documentary on Cruyff, Nummer 14 Johan Cruyff[27] and in the Netherlands there is a magazine by Voetbal International, Nummer 14.[28]\n\nIn a league game against AZ '67 on 29 November 1970, Cruyff scored six goals in an 8\u20131 victory. After winning a replayed KNVB Cup final against Sparta Rotterdam by a score of 2\u20131, Ajax won in Europe for the first time. On 2 June 1971, in London, Ajax won the European Cup by defeating Panathinaikos 2\u20130.[12] He signed a seven-year contract at Ajax. At the end of the season, he was named the Dutch and European Footballer of the Year for 1971.[12]\n\nIn 1972, Ajax won a second European Cup, beating Inter Milan 2\u20130 in the final, with Cruyff scoring both goals.[12] This victory prompted Dutch newspapers to announce the demise of the Italian style of defensive football in the face of Total Football. Soccer: The Ultimate Encyclopaedia says, \"Single-handed, Cruyff not only pulled Internazionale of Italy apart in the 1972 European Cup Final, but scored both goals in Ajax's 2\u20130 win.\"[29] Cruyff also scored in the 3\u20132 victory over ADO Den Haag in the KNVB Cup final. In the league, Cruyff was the top scorer with 25 goals as Ajax became champions. Ajax won the Intercontinental Cup, beating Argentina's Independiente 1\u20131 in the first game followed by 3\u20130, and then in January 1973, they won the European Super Cup by beating Rangers 3\u20131 away and 3\u20132 in Amsterdam. Cruyff's only own goal came on 20 August 1972 against FC Amsterdam. A week later, against Go Ahead Eagles in a 6\u20130 win, Cruyff scored four times for Ajax. The 1972\u201373 season was concluded with another league championship victory and a third successive European Cup with a 1\u20130 win over Juventus in the final.[29]\n\nWhen players like [Gareth] Bale and [Cristiano] Ronaldo are worth around \u20ac100 million, Johan [Cruyff] would go in the billions!\n\n\u2014Franz Beckenbauer, in an interview with Bild.de (September 2014) about Cruyff's transfer value in the early 1970s.[30][31]\n\nIn mid-1973, Cruyff was sold to Barcelona for 6\u00a0million guilders (approx. US$2\u00a0million, c. 1973) in a world record transfer fee.[32] On 19 August 1973, he played his last match for Ajax where they defeated FC Amsterdam 6\u20131, the second match of the 1973\u201374 season.\n\nCruyff endeared himself to the Barcelona fans when he chose a Catalan name, Jordi, for his son. He helped the club win La Liga for the first time since 1960, defeating their fiercest rivals Real Madrid 5\u20130 at their home of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Thousands of Barcelona fans who watched the match on television poured out of their homes to join in street celebrations.[33] A New York Times journalist wrote that Cruyff had done more for the spirit of the Catalan people in 90 minutes than many politicians in years of struggle.[33] Football historian Jimmy Burns stated, \"with Cruyff, the team felt they couldn't lose\".[33] He gave them speed, flexibility and a sense of themselves.[33] In 1974 Cruyff was crowned European Footballer of the Year.[12]\n\nDuring his time at Barcelona, in a game against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Cruyff scored a goal in which he leapt into the air and kicked the ball past Miguel Reina in the Atl\u00e9tico goal with his right heel (the ball was at about neck height and had already travelled wide of the far post).[34] The goal was featured in the documentary En un momento dado, in which fans of Cruyff attempted to recreate that moment. The goal has been dubbed Le but impossible de Cruyff (Cruyff's impossible goal).[citation needed] In 1978, Barcelona defeated Las Palmas 3\u20131, to win the Copa del Rey.[12] Cruyff played two games with Paris Saint-Germain in 1975 during the Paris tournament. He had only agreed because he was a fan of designer Daniel Hechter, who was then president of PSG.[35][36]\n\nCruyff briefly retired in 1978. But after losing most of his money in a series of poor investments, including a pig farm, that were counseled by a scam artist, Cruyff and his family came to the United States.[37][38] As he recalled, \"I had lost millions in pig-farming and that was the reason I decided to become a footballer again.\"[22] Cruyff insisted that his decision to resume his playing career in the United States was pivotal in his career. \"It was wrong, a mistake, to quit playing at 31 with the unique talent I possessed\", and adding that \"Starting from zero in America, many miles away from my past, was one of the best decisions I made. There I learned how to develop my uncontrolled ambitions, to think as a coach and about sponsorship.\"[22]\n\nIn May 1979, Cruyff signed a lucrative deal with the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League (NASL).[39][12] He had previously been rumoured to be joining the New York Cosmos but the deal did not materialise; he played a few exhibition games for the Cosmos. He stayed at the Aztecs for only one season, and was voted NASL Player of the Year. After considering an offer to join Dumbarton F.C. in Scotland, In February 1980, he moved to play for the Washington Diplomats.[40] He played the whole 1980 campaign for the Diplomats, even as the team was facing dire financial trouble. In May 1981, Cruyff played as a guest player for Milan in a tournament, but was injured. As a result, he missed the beginning of the 1981 NASL season, which ultimately led to Cruyff choosing to leave the team. Cruyff also loathed playing on artificial surfaces, which were common in the NASL at the time.\n\nIn January 1981, Cruyff played three friendly matches for FC Dordrecht. Also in January 1981, manager Jock Wallace of English club Leicester City made an attempt to sign Cruyff, competing with Arsenal and an unnamed German club for his services,[41] and despite negotiations lasting three weeks, in which Cruyff expressed his desire to play for the club, a deal could not be reached. Cruyff instead chose to sign with Spanish Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side Levante in February 1981.[42]\n\nOn 1 March 1981, Cruyff took the field for the first time for Levante, starting in a 1\u20130 win against Palencia.[41] Injuries and disagreements with the administration of the club, however, blighted his spell in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and he only made ten appearances, scoring two goals. Having failed to secure promotion to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n, a contract with Levante fell through.[43]\n\nIn June 1981, Cruyff returned to the U.S. and he played for Washington Diplomats in 1981 NASL season.\n\nAfter his spell in the U.S. and his short-lived stay in Spain, Cruyff returned to playing for Ajax in December 1981. Originally, he had rejoined Ajax on 30 November 1980, before his time as a player with Levante, as \"technical advisor\" to trainer Leo Beenhakker, Ajax being eighth in the league table at the time after 13 games played. After 34 games, however, Ajax finished the 1980\u201381 season in second. In December 1981, Cruyff signed a contract as \"player\" with Ajax until the summer of 1983.[43]\n\nIn the 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383 seasons, Ajax, along with Cruyff, became league champions. In 1982\u201383, Ajax won the Dutch Cup (KNVB-Beker). In 1982, he scored a famous goal against Helmond Sport. While playing for Ajax, Cruyff scored a penalty the same way Rik Coppens had done it 25 years earlier.[44][45] He put the ball down as for a routine penalty kick, but instead of shooting at goal, Cruyff nudged the ball sideways to teammate Jesper Olsen, who in return passed it back to Cruyff to tap the ball into the empty net, as Otto Versfeld, the Helmond goalkeeper, looked on.[12]\n\nAt the end of the 1982\u201383 season, Ajax decided not to offer Cruyff a new contract. This angered Cruyff, who responded by signing for Ajax's archrivals Feyenoord.[46] Cruyff's season at Feyenoord was a successful one in which the club won the Eredivisie for the first time in a decade, part of a league and KNVB Cup double. The team's success was due to the performances of Cruyff along with Ruud Gullit and Peter Houtman.[47]\n\n\nDespite his relatively advanced age, Cruyff played all league matches that season except for one. Because of his performance on the field, he was voted as Dutch Footballer of the Year for the fifth time. At the end of the season, the veteran announced his final retirement. He ended his Eredivisie playing career on 13 May 1984 with a goal against PEC Zwolle. Cruyff played his last game in Saudi Arabia against Al-Ahli, bringing Feyenoord back into the game with a goal and an assist.[48]\nAs a Dutch international, Cruyff played 48 matches, scoring 33 goals.[12][49] The national team never lost a match in which Cruyff scored. On 7 September 1966, he made his official debut for the Netherlands in the UEFA Euro 1968 qualifier against Hungary, scoring in the 2\u20132 draw. In his second match, a friendly against Czechoslovakia, Cruyff was the first Dutch international to receive a red card. The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) banned him from Internationals games but not Eredivise or KNVB Cup games.[50]\n\nAccusations of Cruyff's \"aloofness\" were not rebuffed by his habit of wearing a shirt with only two black stripes along the sleeves, as opposed to Adidas' usual design feature of three, worn by all the other Dutch players. Cruyff had a separate sponsorship deal with Puma.[51] From 1970 onwards, he wore the number 14 jersey for the Netherlands, setting a trend for wearing shirt numbers outside the usual starting line-up numbers of 1 to 11.[12]\n\nCruyff led the Netherlands to a runners-up medal in the 1974 World Cup and was named player of the tournament.[12] Thanks to his team's mastery of Total Football, they coasted all the way to the final, knocking out Argentina (4\u20130), East Germany (2\u20130) and Brazil (2\u20130) along the way.[12] Cruyff scored twice against Argentina in one of his team's most dominating performances, then he scored the second goal against Brazil to knock out the defending champions.[12]\n\nThe Netherlands faced hosts West Germany in the final. Cruyff kicked off and the ball was passed around the Oranje team 15 times before returning to Cruyff, who then went on a run past Berti Vogts and ended when he was fouled by Uli Hoene\u00df inside the box. Teammate Johan Neeskens scored from the spot kick to give the Netherlands a 1\u20130 lead and the Germans had not yet touched the ball.[12] During the latter half of the final, his influence was stifled by the effective marking of Vogts, while Franz Beckenbauer, Uli Hoene\u00df and Wolfgang Overath dominated the midfield as West Germany came back to win 2\u20131.[52]\n\nCruyff retired from international football in October 1977, having helped the national team qualify for the upcoming World Cup.[12] Without him, the Netherlands finished runners-up in the World Cup again. Initially, there were two rumours as to his reason for missing the 1978 World Cup: either he missed it for political reasons (a military dictatorship was in power in Argentina at that time), or that his wife dissuaded him from playing.[53] In 2008, Cruyff stated to the journalist Antoni Bassas in Catalunya R\u00e0dio that he and his family were subject to a kidnap attempt in Barcelona a year before the tournament, and that this had caused his retirement. \"To play a World Cup you have to be 200% okay, there are moments when there are other values in life.\"[54]\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Cruyff followed in the footsteps of his mentor Rinus Michels, coaching a young Ajax side to victory in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1987 (1\u20130). In May and June 1985, Cruyff returned to Ajax again. In the 1985\u201386 season, the league title was lost to Jan Reker's PSV, despite Ajax having a goal difference of +85 (120 goals for, 35 goals against). In the 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387 seasons, Ajax won the KNVB Cup.\n\nIt was during this period as manager that Cruyff was able to implement his favoured team formation\u2014three mobile defenders; plus one more covering space \u2013 becoming, in effect, a defensive midfielder (from Rijkaard, Blind, Silooy, Verlaat, Larsson, Spelbos), two \"controlling\" midfielders (from Rijkaard, Scholten, Winter, Wouters, M\u00fchren, Witschge) with responsibilities to feed the attack-minded players, one second striker (Bosman, Scholten), two touchline-hugging wingers (from Bergkamp, van't Schip, De Wit, Witschge) and one versatile centre forward (from Van Basten, Meijer, Bosman). So successful was this system that Ajax won the Champions League in 1995 playing Cruyff's system \u2013 a tribute to Cruyff's legacy as Ajax coach.[55]\n\nAfter having appeared for the club as a player, Cruyff returned to Barcelona for the 1988\u201389 season, this time to take up his new role as coach of the first team. Before returning to Barcelona, however, Cruyff had already built up plenty of experience as a coach/manager. In the Netherlands, he was strongly praised for the attacking flair he imposed on his sides and also for his commendable work as talent spotter. With Bar\u00e7a, Cruyff started work with a completely remodelled side after the previous season's scandal, known as the \"Hesperia Mutiny\" (\"El Mot\u00ed de l'Hesp\u00e8ria\u00a0[ca]\" in Catalan). His second in command was Carles Rexach, who had already been at the club for a year. Cruyff immediately had his Bar\u00e7a charges playing his attractive brand of football and the results did not take long in coming. But, this did not just happen with the first team, the youth teams also displayed that same attacking style, something that made it easier for reserve players to make the switch to first team football.[56][57] As Sid Lowe noted, when Cruyff took over as manager, Barcelona of the late 1980s \"were a club in debt and in crisis. Results were bad, performances were worse, the atmosphere terrible and attendances down, while even the relationship between the president of the club Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez and the president of the Spanish autonomous community they represented, Jordi Pujol, had deteriorated. It did not work immediately but he [Cruyff] recovered the identity he had embodied as a player. He took risks, and rewards followed.\"[58]\n\nAt Bar\u00e7a, Cruyff brought in players such as Pep Guardiola, Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero, Txiki Begiristain, Andoni Goikoetxea, Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Rom\u00e1rio, Gheorghe Hagi and Hristo Stoichkov. With Cruyff, Bar\u00e7a experienced a glorious era. In the space of five years (1989\u20131994), he led the club to four European finals (two European Cup Winners' Cup finals and two European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals). Cruyff's track record includes one European Cup, four Liga championships, one Cup Winners' Cup, one Copa del Rey and four Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a.[59]\n\nUnder Cruyff, Bar\u00e7a's \"Dream Team\" won four La Liga titles in a row (1991\u20131994), and beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley Stadium.[60][57]\nOn 10 May 1989, goals from Salinas and L\u00f3pez Rekarte led Barcelona to a 2\u20130 victory against Sampdoria. Over 25,000 supporters travelled to Switzerland to support the team. Cruyff's new Bar\u00e7a took home the club's third Cup Winners' Cup. The European Cup dream became a reality on 20 May 1992 at Wembley in London, when Bar\u00e7a beat Sampdoria. Cruyff's last instruction to his players before they stepped onto the pitch was \"Salid y disfrutad\" (Spanish for \"Go out and enjoy it\" or \"Go out there and enjoy yourselves\").[61][62] The match went to extra time after a scoreless draw. In the 111th minute, Ronald Koeman's brilliant free kick clinched Bar\u00e7a's first European Cup victory. Twenty-five thousand supporters accompanied the team to Wembley, while one million turned out on the streets of Barcelona to welcome the European champions home.[61] Victories under Cruyff include a 5\u20130 La Liga win over Real Madrid in El Cl\u00e1sico at the Camp Nou, as well as a 4\u20130 win against Manchester United in the Champions League.[63][64][65] Barcelona won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, as well as finishing runner-up to Manchester United and Milan in two European finals.[60]\n\nWith 11 trophies, Cruyff was Barcelona's most successful manager, but has since been surpassed by his former player Pep Guardiola, who achieved 15. Cruyff was also the club's longest-serving manager. In his final two seasons, however, he failed to win any trophies, falling out with chairman Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who ultimately sacked him as Barcelona coach.[66]\n\nWhile still at Barcelona, Cruyff was in negotiations with the KNVB to manage the national team for the 1994 World Cup finals, but talks broke off at the last minute.[67]\n\nAs well as representing Catalonia on the pitch in 1976, Cruyff also managed the Catalonia national team from 2009 to 2013, leading the team to a victory over Argentina in his debut match.[68]\n\nOn 2 November 2009, Cruyff was named as manager of the Catalonia national team. It was his first managing job in 13 years.[69] On 22 December 2009, they played a friendly game against Argentina, which ended in a Catalonia win, 4\u20132 at Camp Nou. On 28 December 2010, Catalonia played a friendly against Honduras winning 4\u20130 at Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys.[70] On 30 December 2011, Catalonia played Tunisia in a goalless draw at the Llu\u00eds Companys.[71] In their last game under Cruyff, on 2 January 2013, Catalonia drew with Nigeria at the Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, 1\u20131.[72]\n\nLater in his reign as Barcelona manager, Cruyff suffered a heart attack and was advised to quit coaching by his doctors. He left in 1996, and never took another top job, but his influence did not end there. Though he vowed never to coach again, he remained a vocal football critic and analyst. Cruyff's open support helped candidate Joan Laporta to victory in Barcelona's presidential elections. He continued to be an adviser for him, although he held no official post at Barcelona.[73][74] Back in an advisory capacity alongside Joan Laporta, he recommended the appointment of Frank Rijkaard in 2003. Again Barca was successful, winning back-to-back league titles and another Champions League crown in 2006.\n\nAfter two relatively disappointing campaigns, Laporta survived a censure motion and an overhaul was needed. In summer 2008, Rijkaard left the club and even though Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was pushing for the job at Camp Nou, Cruyff chose Pep Guardiola. Many were quick to point to Guardiola's lack of coaching experience, but Cruyff said, \"The biggest test for a coach at a team like Bar\u00e7a is the strength to make decisions and the ability to talk to the press, because they don't help and you have to manage that. After that, it's easy for those who know football. But there aren't many who know.\"[75]\n\nOn 26 March 2010, Cruyff was named honorary president of Barcelona in recognition of his contributions to the club as both a player and manager.[76] In July 2010, however, he was stripped of this title by new president Sandro Rosell.[77][78]\n\nOn 20 February 2008, in the wake of a major research on the ten-year-mismanagement, it was announced that Cruyff would be the new technical director at his boyhood club Ajax, his fourth stint with the Amsterdam club.[79] Cruyff announced in March that he was pulling out of his planned return to Ajax because of \"professional difference of opinion\" between him and Ajax's new manager, Marco van Basten. Van Basten said that Cruyff's plans were \"going too fast\", because he was \"not so dissatisfied with how things are going now\".[80]\n\nOn 11 February 2011, Cruyff returned to Ajax on an advisory basis after agreeing to become a member of one of three \"sounding board groups\".[81] After presenting his plans to reform the club, in particular to rejuvenate the youth academy, the Ajax board of advisors and the CEO resigned on 30 March 2011.[82] On 6 June 2011, he was appointed to the new Ajax board of advisors to implement his reform plans.[83][84]\n\nThe Ajax advisory board made a verbal agreement with Louis van Gaal to appoint him as the new CEO, without consulting Cruyff.[85] Cruyff, a fellow board member, took Ajax to court in an attempt to block the appointment.[86] The court overturned the appointment, saying that the board had \"deliberately put Cruyff offside\".[87] Due to the ongoing quarrel within the advisory board, Cruyff resigned on 10 April 2012, with Ajax stating that Cruyff will \"remain involved with the implementation of his football vision within the club\".[88]\n\nCruyff became a technical advisor for Mexican club Guadalajara in February 2012. Jorge Vergara, the owner of the club, made him the team's sport consultant in response to the losing record Guadalajara sustained in the last few months of 2011.[89] Although signed to a three-year contract, Cruyff's contract was terminated December 2012 after just nine months with the club. Guadalajara said that other members of the team's coaching staff would likely not be terminated.[90]\n\nIn September 2009, Cruyff and Ruud Gullit were unveiled as ambassadors for the Belgium\u2013Netherlands joint bid for the World Cup finals in 2018 or 2022 at the official launch in Eindhoven.[91]\n\nCruyff is widely seen as a revolutionary figure in the history of Ajax, Barcelona, and the Netherlands. The style of play Cruyff introduced at Barcelona later came to be known as tiki-taka\u2014characterised by short passing and movement, working the ball through various channels, and maintaining possession\u2014which was later adopted by the Euro 2008, 2010 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2012 winning Spain national football team.[92]\n\nThroughout his career, Cruyff became synonymous with the playing style of \"Total Football\".[93][94][95] It is a system where a player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team, thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure. In this fluid system, no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role. The style was honed by Ajax coach Rinus Michels, with Cruyff serving as the on-field \"conductor\".[96][97] Space and the creation of it were central to the concept of Total Football. Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff, who played with Cruyff, explained how the team that won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973 worked it to their advantage: \"We discussed space the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where people should run, where they should stand, where they should not be moving. It was all about making space and coming into space. It is a kind of architecture on the field. We always talked about speed of ball, space and time. Where is the most space? Where is the player who has the most time? That is where we have to play the ball. Every player had to understand the whole geometry of the whole pitch and the system as a whole.\"[98]\n\nThe team orchestrator, Cruyff was a creative playmaker with a gift for timing passes.[99] Nominally, he played centre-forward in this system and was a prolific goalscorer, but dropped deep to confuse his markers or moved to the wing to great effect.[100] In the 1974 World Cup final between West Germany and the Netherlands, from the kick-off, the Dutch monopolised ball possession. At the start of the move that led to the opening goal, Cruyff picked up the ball in his own half. The Dutch captain, who was nominally a centre-forward, was the deepest Dutch outfield player, and after a series of passes, he set off on a run from the centre circle into the West German box. Unable to stop Cruyff by fair means, Uli Hoeness brought Cruyff down, conceding a penalty scored by Johan Neeskens. The first German to thus touch the ball was goalkeeper Sepp Maier picking the ball out of his own net.[101] Due to the way Cruyff played the game, he is still referred to as \"the total footballer\".[102]\n\nCruyff was known for his technical ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. \"Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina\", he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. \"There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players.\" On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: \"Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate.\"[103]\n\nWinning is just one day, a reputation can last a lifetime. Winning is an important thing, but to have your own style, to have people copy you, to admire you, that is the greatest gift.\nCruyff always considered the aesthetic and moral aspects of the game; it was not just about winning, but about winning with the \u2018right\u2019 style and in the \u2018right\u2019 way. He also always spoke highly of the entertainment value of the game. The beautiful game, for him, was as much about entertainment and joy as results. In the thinking of Cruyff, victory was only truly meaningful when it could fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. As he once noted, \"Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring,\".[105] For Cruyff, choosing a \u2019right\u2019 style of play to win was even more important than winning itself.[106][107] Cruyff always believed in simplicity, seeing simplicity and beauty as inseparable. \"Simple football is the most beautiful. But playing simple football is the hardest thing\", as Cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy.[108] \"How often do you see a pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough?... To play well, you need good players, but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency. He always wants to do things prettier than strictly necessary.\"[109]\n\nCruyff also perfected a feint now known as the \"Cruyff Turn\".[100] The feint is an example of the simplicity in Cruyff's football philosophy. It was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd, but because Cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method (in terms of effort and risk versus expected result) to beat his opponent. Cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball, then, instead of kicking it, he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turned through 180 degrees, and accelerated away.[110] As Swedish defender Jan Olsson (a \"victim\" of the Cruyff Turn at the 1974 World Cup) recalled, \"I played 18 years in top football and seventeen times for Sweden but that moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career. I thought I'd win the ball for sure, but he tricked me. I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius.\"[111]\n\nLike Dutch football in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British coaches such as Vic Buckingham.[112][113]\n\nThe mind-body duality always played an important role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff's words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, \"...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.\"[114] For Cruyff, football was an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, \"Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late.\"[98]\n\nThe creativity was always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, \"Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [recommended by Van Gaal] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you cannot measure with a computer.\"[115]\n\nIn his posthumously released autobiography My Turn: The Autobiography,[116] Cruyff reveals his dream all-time XI in his favourite 3\u20134\u20133/4\u20133\u20133 formation. Cruyff's side (in the 3\u20134\u20133 diamond formation) reads as follows: Lev Yashin (goalkeeper); Ruud Krol (full back/wing-back), Franz Beckenbauer (central defender/libero), Carlos Alberto (full-back/wing-back); Pep Guardiola (holding midfielder/midfield anchor), Bobby Charlton, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Diego Maradona (playmaker/attacking midfielder/second striker); Piet Keizer (winger), Garrincha (winger), and Pel\u00e9 (centre-forward/striker). For humility, Cruyff did not put himself in there, but there is a spot for his pupil, Pep Guardiola and his former teammates, Ruud Krol and Piet Keizer. It's a typically attacking line-up but Cruyff explains the selection in detail. \"For the ideal squad, I also try and find a formula in which talent is used to the maximum in every case\", notes Cruyff. \"The qualities of one player have to complement the qualities of another.\"[117][118]\n\nIn his autobiography, Cruyff explained why he made a set of 14 basic rules, which are displayed at every Cruyff Court in the world: \"I read an article once about the building of the pyramids in Egypt. It turns out that some of the numbers coincide completely with natural laws \u2013 the position of the moon at certain times and so on. And it makes you think: how is it possible that those ancient people built something so scientifically complex? They must have had something that we don't, even though we always think that we're a lot more advanced than they were. Take Rembrandt and van Gogh: who can match them today? When I think that way, I'm increasingly convinced that everything is actually possible. If they managed to do the impossible nearly five thousand years ago, why can't we do it today? That applies equally to football, but also to something like the Cruyff Courts and school sports grounds. My fourteen rules are set out for every court and every school sports ground to follow. They are there to teach young people that sports and games can also be translated into everyday life.\"[116]\n\nAnd he listed his 14 basic rules that include:\n\nIn 2018, Cruyff was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in EA Sports' FIFA video game FIFA 19, receiving a 94 rating.[121] British sportswriter David Winner's 2000 book on Dutch football, Brilliant Orange, mentions Cruyff frequently. In the book, Dutch football's ideas (in particular Cruyff's) effectively related to the use of space in Dutch painting and Dutch architecture.\n\nIn 1976, the Italian-language documentary film Il profeta del gol was directed by Sandro Ciotti. The documentary narrates the successes of Johan Cruyff's football career in the 1970s. In 2004, the documentary film Johan Cruijff \u2013 En un momento dado (\"Johan Cruijff \u2013 At Any Given Moment\") was made by Ramon Gieling and charts the years Cruyff spent at Barcelona, the club where he had the most profound effect in both a footballing and cultural sense. In 2014, the Catalan-language documentary film L'\u00faltim partit: 40 anys de Johan Cruyff a Catalunya was directed by Jordi Marcos, celebrating 40 years since Johan Cruyff signed for Barcelona in August 1973.\n\nBritish rock band The Hours recorded a song called \"Love You More\" in 2007. In it lead singer Antony Genn described his partner as \"Better than Elvis in his '68 comeback, Better than Cruyff in '74..\", In an interview with German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung in 2008, when German Chancellor Angela Merkel was discussing the upcoming Euro 2008, she praised Cruyff's performance at the 1974 World Cup: \"Cruyff really impressed me. I think I wasn't the only one in Europe.\"[122] Cruyff stood out at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany which Merkel watched from her then home country East Germany.[123]\n\nIn the Netherlands, and to some extent Spain, Cruyff is famous for his one-liners that usually hover between brilliant insight and the blatantly obvious. They are famous for their Amsterdam dialect and incorrect grammar, and often feature tautologies and paradoxes.[124] In Spain, his most famous statement is \"En un momento dado\" (\"In any given moment\"). The quote has been used for the title of a 2004 documentary about Cruyff's life: Johan Cruijff \u2013 En un momento dado. In the Netherlands, his most famous one-liner is \"Ieder nadeel heb z'n voordeel\" (\"Every disadvantage has its advantage\") and his way of expressing himself has been dubbed \"Cruijffiaans\". Cruyff rarely limited himself to a single line though, and in a comparison with the equally oracular but reserved football manager Rinus Michels, Kees Fens equated Cruyff's monologues to experimental prose, \"without a subject, only an attempt to drop words in a sea of uncertainty ... there is no full stop\".[124]\n\nHe had a small hit (number 21 in the charts) in the Netherlands with \"Oei Oei Oei (Dat Was Me Weer Een Loei)\". Upon arriving in Barcelona, the Spanish branch of Polydor decided to release the single in Spain as well, where it was rather popular.[125]\n\nCruyff suffered a heart attack (like his father who died of a heart attack when he was 12) in his early forties. He used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day prior to undergoing double heart bypass surgery in 1991 while he was the coach of Barcelona. Cruyff was forced to immediately give up smoking, and he made an anti-smoking advertisement for the Catalan Department of Health. In the TV spot, Cruyff is dressed like a manager in a long trench coat combined with collared shirt and necktie. He performed keepy-uppies with a pack of cigarettes by juggling it 16 times \u2013 using feet, thighs, knees, heel, chest, shoulder, and head like holding up a ball \u2013 before volleying it away. Throughout the commercial he speaks in Catalan about the dangers of smoking.[126]\n\nIn November 2003, Cruyff invoked legal proceedings against the publisher Tirion Uitgevers, over its photo book Johan Cruyff de Ajacied (\"Johan Cruijff the Ajax player\"), which used photographs by Guus de Jong. Cruyff was working on another book, also using De Jong's photographs, and claimed unsuccessfully that Tirion's book violated his trademark and portrait rights.\n\nIn 2004, a public poll in the Netherlands to determine the greatest Dutchman (\"De Grootste Nederlander\") named Cruyff the 6th-greatest Dutchman of all time, with Cruyff finishing above Rembrandt (9th) and Vincent van Gogh (10th).[127] In 2010, the asteroid (minor planet) 14282 Cruijff (2097 P-L)\u00a0[de] was named after him. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially ratified the naming of Cruijff on 23 September 2010. After Josef Bican and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Cruyff is the third football player to have an asteroid named after him.[128][129]\n\nThere were many nicknames Cruyff had in the Netherlands and Spain, including \"Jopie\", \"Nummer 14\" (Number 14),[130] \"Het orakel van Betondorp\" (the prophet of Betondorp), \"El Salvador\" (The Saviour), and \"El Flaco\" (The Skinny One). One of his best known nicknames was \"El Salvador\" or \"The Saviour\", a nickname he received during the 1973\u201374 season and again in 1988, when he helped terminate crisis eras in Bar\u00e7a's history.[58][104][131] However, contrary to popular belief, the nickname \"El Salvador\" is a Dutch rather than Spanish invention.[132]\n\nOutside football, Cruyff's favourite sport (and hobby) was golf.[133][134] In the 1970s, Cruyff loved to collect cars. In the Sandro Ciotti's documentary film Il Profeta del gol (1976), Cruyff said, \"I like to drive for the 20 km that separate the training camp from my house, it relaxes me. I love the cars.\"[135]\n\nIn 1979, Cruyff was reaching the twilight of his career in Barcelona. He began to imagine creating a range of footwear himself to challenge the technical and luxury qualities of those on the market beforehand. After a few years of trying and failing to encourage big sportswear brands to take his idea seriously, after all this was quite an unusual ambition of a professional sportsman at the time. Eventually he combined with his close friend, Italian designer Emilio Lazzarini, and using his knowledge he set out to create a technical shoe which managed to balance functionality with elegance. Initially the range was filled with \"luxury\" indoor football shoes, but they quickly became used as a fashion shoe due to their attractive appearance. And so Cruyff Classics brand was born.[136][137]\n\nCruyff is the author/co-author of several books (in Dutch and Spanish) about his football career, in particular his principles and view about the football world. He also wrote his weekly columns for El Peri\u00f3dico (Barcelona-based newspaper) and De Telegraaf (Amsterdam-based newspaper).[138]\n\nCruyff was multilingual; British football writer Brian Glanville wrote: \"his intelligence off the field as well as on it was quite remarkable. How well I remember seeing Cruyff surrounded by journalists from all over the world in 1978 to whose questions he replied almost casually in a multiplicity of languages. Not only Dutch, but English, French, Spanish and German.\"[139]\n\nThe Johan Cruyff Foundation[140] has provided over 200 Cruyff Courts in 22 countries, including Israel, Malaysia, Japan, United States and Mexico, for children of all backgrounds to play street football together. UEFA praised the foundation for its positive effect on young people, and Cruyff received the UEFA Grassroots Award on the opening of the 100th court in late 2009.[141] In 1999, he founded the Johan Cruyff Institute with a programme for 35 athletes as part of the Johan Cruyff University of Amsterdam and has since become a global network.[142]\n\nBorn in the heavily damaged post\u2013World War II Netherlands, Cruyff came from a humble background and lost his father as a child. This had a great influence on his future career and character. He was renowned for his strong personality. His character, both in and beyond the footballing world, was much described as the complicated combination of an idealist,[143] individualist, libertarian, collectivist, romantic, purist, pragmatist, rebel,[144] and even despot.[145] Dutch sportswriter Johan Derksen, a close friend of Cruyff, once said of him, \"Johan is absolutely religious, though he never goes to church.\"[146]\n\nIn August 1973, Ajax players voted for Piet Keizer to be the team's captain in a secret ballot, ahead of Cruyff. And Cruyff decided his time in Amsterdam had come to an end. He joined Barcelona just weeks later, two years before the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco died, maintaining to the European press corps en route that he chose Barcelona over rivals Real Madrid because he could never join a club \"associated with Franco\".[147] As he recalled in a documentary on TV3 channel, \"I remember my move to Spain was quite controversial. ... The president of Ajax wanted to sell me to Real Madrid, ... Barcelona weren't at the same level as Madrid football wise, but it was a challenge to play for a Catalan club. Barcelona was more than a club.\"[148] At the end of the 1982\u201383 season, Ajax decided not to offer Cruyff a new contract. This angered Cruyff and he responded by signing for Ajax's archrivals Feyenoord. Cruyff's season at Feyenoord was a successful one in which the club won the Eredivisie for the first time in a decade, part of a league and KNVB Cup double.[47]\n\nCruyff's strong personality played a role in the struggle between Puma and Adidas, the two rival brands that were born from the divisions between the two Dassler brothers.[135] Cruyff was a fan of Puma's King boots and by 1974 had signed a sponsorship deal with the German sportswear and equipment supplier. At the 1974 World Cup, he was under contract with Puma in a deal that prohibited him from promoting other sports brands. As the tournament approached, Cruyff flatly refused to wear Adidas's trademark three black stripes on his No. 14 jersey. The Netherlands national football association had little choice but to honour the wishes of their best player, and Dutch officials eventually persuaded Adidas to design a separate jersey just for Cruyff, with just two stripes running along the sleeves.[149][150]\n\nUntil the 1990s, players did not have fixed numbering \u2014 except in some short competitions like the World Cup or European Championship where players were given a designated number. The starting players usually wore jerseys from 1 to 11 and the substitutes from 12 to 16. Cruyff's usual number was 9.[151]\n\nOn 30 October 1970, Cruyff was coming back from a long-term injury to play Ajax's rivals PSV. However, in the locker room before the match, teammate Gerrie Muhren could not find his number 7 jersey. Cruyff offered his shirt to Muhren and went to the basket to pick another one at random. It happened to be the number 14.[151] Ajax won 1\u20130 and Cruyff suggested they keep the same numbers to the following game \u2014 according to Muhren, in an interview to Voetbal International, it was a form to challenge the Dutch Football Association.[151] From then on, Cruyff kept using the number 14 for Ajax and Netherlands national team when he was allowed to.[12][151]\n\nIn the 1974 FIFA World Cup, Netherlands' head coach Rinus Michels wanted his squad to wear numbers alphabetically. As Cruyff was the first player on the roster, he would be number 1, but he refused and insisted on wearing his lucky number 14.[151] Forward Ruud Geels ended up with the number 1 shirt while goalkeeper Jan Jongbloed played as the number 8.\n\nAlthough the number 14 had become a trademark for Cruyff, he could be seen wearing his old number 9 on other occasions, like during most of his career for FC Barcelona, because the league demanded starting players were numbered 1 to 11,[152] or for Netherlands in the 1976 European Championship. In 2007, Ajax retired Cruyff's number 14.[151]\n\nCruyff remained a controversial figure throughout his life. His relationships with Ajax, Bar\u00e7a, and KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association) were turbulent for some time, especially in his later years. In his native Netherlands, there was always a love\u2013hate relationship between Cruyff and his fellow countrymen.[153] There was a long-standing feud between Cruyff and Louis van Gaal, though never confirmed publicly by both sides.[154] He also often criticised Jos\u00e9 Mourinho for his defensive-based coaching philosophy, stated, \"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is a negative coach. He only cares about the result and does not care much for good football.\" As David Winner notes, \"Cruyff has had many enemies and critics over the years.\"[155] He has been accused of being arrogant, greedy,[153] intolerant, despotic, \"too idealistic, too stubborn, insufficiently interested in defending and simply too difficult a personality. He loves an argument, and his conflict-model method of working can be bruising.\"[155] And Winner concludes that, \"With his belief in the \"conflict model\" \u2013 the idea that you got the best out of people by provoking fights and thereby raising levels of excitement and adrenaline \u2013 Cruyff made enemies almost as easily as he generated delight. Battles with club presidents and teammates led to ruptures, especially at Ajax and Barcelona, the two clubs that defined his career.\"[156]\n\nCruyff was also well known for his vocal criticism and uncompromising attitude. A perfectionist, he always had a strong opinion about things and was loyal to his principles even more than anything else in the football world.[157] As an outspoken and critical visionary, he strongly criticized the Netherlands' style of play at the 2010 World Cup. \"Who am I supporting? I am Dutch but I support the football that Spain is playing. Spain's style is the style of Barcelona... Spain, a replica of Bar\u00e7a, is the best publicity for football\", Cruyff wrote in his weekly column for the Barcelona-based newspaper El Peri\u00f3dico, prior to the final match.[158]\n\nUntil the early 2010s, Barcelona had mounting debts, built up over the previous few seasons, a situation that forced the club to push through an emergency bailout loan of \u20ac150\u00a0million. The Qatar Foundation, run by Sheikha Mozah, became the first shirt sponsor in Barcelona's 111-year history. The club had previously used UNICEF's logo on the front of its shirts.[159] In 2011, incoming Barcelona president Sandro Rosell agreed the deal for a period of five seasons, with the club receiving \u20ac30\u00a0million each year, starting on 1 July 2011 and running until 30 June 2016, plus bonuses for trophies won that could total \u20ac5m.[160] Writing in his El Peri\u00f3dico column, Cruyff slammed the deal, \"We are a unique club in the world, no one has kept their jersey intact throughout their history, yet have remained as competitive as they come... We have sold this uniqueness for about six percent of our budget. I understand that we are currently losing more than we are earning. However, by selling the shirt it shows me that we are not being creative, and that we have become vulgar.\"[161]\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian's Donald McRae in 2014, Cruyff spoke about football's lost values and how money had eroded the game's purity, \"Football is now all about money. There are problems with the values within the game. This is sad because football is the most beautiful game. We can play it in the street. We can play it everywhere. Everyone can play it whether you're tall or small, fat or thin. But those values are being lost. We have to bring them back.\"[162]\n\nAt the wedding of Ajax teammate Piet Keizer, on 13 June 1967, Cruyff met his future wife, Diana Margaretha \"Danny\" Coster (born 1949). They started dating, and on 2 December 1968, at the age of 21, he married Danny. Her father was Dutch businessman Cor Coster who also happened to be Cruyff's agent. He was also credited with engineering Cruyff's move to FC Barcelona in 1973. The marriage is said to have been happy for almost 50 years.[163] Contrary to his well-known strong personality and superstar status, Cruyff led a relatively quiet private life beyond the world of football.[164] A highly principled, strong-minded and devoted family man, Cruyff's football career, both as a player and as a manager, was considerably influenced by his family, in particular his wife Danny.[165][166] He and Danny had three children together: Chantal (16 November 1970), Susila (27 January 1972), and Jordi (9 February 1974). The family has lived in Barcelona since 1973, with a six-year interruption from December 1981 to January 1988 when they lived in Vinkeveen, the Netherlands.[167]\n\nIn 1977, Cruyff announced his decision to retire from international football at the age of 30, despite still being lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup.[168] This move, shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff explained his decision in an interview with Catalunya R\u00e0dio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona.[169] And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory at the end of his international career. In the interview with Catalunya R\u00e0dio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, \"You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [put] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change your point of view towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.\"[170]\n\nCruyff named his third child after the patron saint of Catalonia, St Jordi, commonly known in English as Saint George of Lydda. This was seen as a provocative gesture towards the then Spanish dictator General Franco, who had made all symbols of Catalan nationalism illegal. Cruyff had to fly his son back to the Netherlands to register his birth as the name \"Jordi\" had been banned by the Spanish authorities. Cruyff's decision to go to such great lengths to support Catalan nationalism is part of the reason he is a hero to Barcelona supporters and Catalan nationalists.[171]\n\nJordi Cruyff played for teams such as Barcelona (while father Johan was manager), Manchester United, Alav\u00e9s and Espanyol.  He wore \"Jordi\" on his shirt to distinguish himself from his father, which also reflects the common Spanish practice of referring to players by given names alone or by nicknames. His grandson, Jesjua Angoy, played for Dayton Dutch Lions.  Pep Guardiola, Ronald Koeman, and Joan Laporta were among Cruyff's closest friends.[172] Estelle Cruijff, a niece of Cruyff, was married to Ruud Gullit for 12 years (2000\u20132012),[173][174] and their son Maxim Gullit plays for Cambuur.[175]\n\nCruyff once described himself as \"not religious\" and criticised the practices of devoutly Catholic Spanish players: \"In Spain all 22 players make the sign of the cross before a game; if it worked, every game would be a tie.\"[176] That widely quoted statement earned him a place on lists of the world's top atheist athletes. But in the 1990s, Cruyff told the Dutch Catholic radio station RKK/KRO that as a child he attended Sunday school, where he was taught about the Bible, and that while he did not go to church as an adult, he believed \"there's something there.\"[177] The Dutch evangelical broadcaster EO posted an interview conducted before Cruyff's death with his friend Johan Derksen, the editor-in-chief of Voetbal International magazine. \"People don't know the real Johan Cruyff\", Derksen said. \"I have on occasion had beautiful conversations with him about faith, because we both went to the same kind of schools and learned about the Bible. And it stays with you.\"[178][179]\nCruyff also expressed his faith in God in an interview with Hanneke Groenteman on Sterren op het Doek.[180]\n\nHe has enriched and personified our football. He was an icon of the Netherlands. Johan Cruijff belonged to all of us.\n\n\u2014King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands pays tribute following Cruyff's death.[182]\n\nCruyff had always been a heavy smoker from his boyhood until he underwent an emergency bypass operation in 1991. After giving up smoking following the surgery, he took to sucking lollipops when watching games.[183] He featured in a Catalan health department advertisement, saying, \"Football has given me everything in life, tobacco almost took it all away.\"[183][184] After more heart trouble in 1997, he vowed never to coach again (until 2009), though he remained a vocal football critic and analyst.[185]\n\nIn October 2015 he was diagnosed with lung cancer.[186] After the news broke, tributes poured in for Cruyff, with all Eredivisie games featuring a round of applause on 14 minutes, Cruyff's former shirt number. Ahead of their league game against Eibar at the Camp Nou (25 October 2015), Barcelona players showed their support for Cruyff by wearing orange T-shirts bearing the words \"\u00c0nims Johan\" (Catalan for \"Get well soon Johan\"). Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, \"Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.\" On his condition, Cruyff added, \"Meanwhile, we have to wait. It's really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now is that I have lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.\"[187]\n\nIn mid-February 2016, he stated that he had been responding well to chemotherapy and was \"winning\" his cancer battle.[188][189] On 2 March 2016, he was in attendance on the second day of winter testing at the Circuit de Catalunya just outside Barcelona and visited Dutch Formula One driver Max Verstappen. Cruyff appeared to be in good spirits and it is believed this was the last time he was seen in public.[190][191][192] On the morning of 24 March 2016, in a clinic in Barcelona, Cruyff died at the age of 68, surrounded by his wife, children, and grandchildren.[193] His lung cancer had metastasized to his brain and a week before his death he had begun to lose his ability to speak as well as movement on his left side. He was cremated in Barcelona within 24 hours[194] of his death. A private ceremony was held, attended only by his wife, children and grandchildren.[195][196][197]\n\nWithin a week of his death, several people (including players and managers) and organisations (including clubs) paid tribute to him, especially via social media.[198][199][200][201] Thousands of Barcelona fans passed through the memorial to Cruyff, opened inside the Camp Nou stadium, to pay tribute.[202][203][204] Former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell, who did not have a good relationship with Cruyff, was among the early visitors to the memorial.[205] Real Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez led a Real Madrid delegation to the memorial, including former players Emilio Butrague\u00f1o and Amancio Amaro.[206]\n\nA friendly match between the Netherlands and France was held on the day after Cruyff's death. The play (at the Amsterdam Arena) was stopped in the 14th minute as players, staff, and supporters gave a minute's applause for Cruyff, who wore the number 14 shirt for his country.

He played with the Carlton and Brisbane Lions football clubs in the Australian Football League (AFL).\n\nFevola is regarded as one of the most effective full-forwards to have played AFL in the 2000s,[citation needed] having won the Coleman Medal for league leading goalkicker in 2006 and 2009 (kicking 84 and 86 goals, respectively) as well as All-Australian selection as a forward three times since 2006. His representative honours include playing for Victoria, where he was awarded the Allen Aylett Medal for being the state team's best player, and leading goalkicker. During his career at Carlton, he was the club's leading goalkicker and key forward from 2003 until 2009. However, throughout his career he has been a controversial figure off the field, which ultimately led to him parting company with both of his AFL clubs.\n\nBrendan was born to Italian Australian Angelo Fevola, a Victorian state representative in lacrosse, and Karen Ralph in 1981.[1] His parents split when he was eight years old.[1] For a short time he attended a Catholic school.[1]\n\nFevola began playing football with the Beaconsfield Junior Football Club in the Dandenong & District Junior Football League, before playing senior football in the Victorian Country Football League. His ability to kick goals for the Dandenong Stingrays earned him selection in the TAC Cup Team of the Year in 1998[2] and attracted the eye of recruiters and was one of three talented AFL prospects featured in the television documentary \"The Draft\".\n\nFevola was recruited to Carlton Football Club with selection No. 38 overall in the 1998 AFL Draft.[3] Early in his career he showed signs of being a brilliant kick of the ball and a prospective key position player at full forward, and he led the AFL reserves for the 1999 season with 42 goals, despite Carlton finishing last for the year.[4] During a pre-season game on 31 December 1999 against Collingwood (promoted as the \"Millennium Match\"), he kicked 12 goals.[5]\n\nThe promising talent was given the No. 25 guernsey made famous by Carlton legend Alex Jesaulenko.\n\nHowever Fevola struggled to maintain form over the next few years, playing in 39 games and kicking 66 goals between 2000 and 2002, with noticeably poor body language on-field as well as causing bad publicity through incidents off-field.[5] Carlton Football club senior coach Wayne Brittain had intended to trade or delist Fevola at the end of the 2002 season; however, after Carlton's poor season (in which it won the wooden spoon) Brittain was himself sacked, and incoming senior coach Denis Pagan reversed Brittain's decision.[6]\n\nPagan's arrival had an immediate impact on Fevola's discipline and form. In Round 5, 2003, Fevola kicked 8 goals against the Kangaroos, helping win the game for Carlton and launching himself into the eyes of AFL viewers. Fevola's unkempt dreadlocks and extroverted personality in the media earned him the nickname \"The Shag\" by fans.[citation needed]\n\nFevola's early goalkicking inconsistency saw him experiment with unorthodox styles of handling the ball in approach to taking set shots. In 2004, Fevola developed a ritualistic set-shot routine of taking three quick steps to shoot on goal, and this resulted in a significant increase in goalkicking accuracy, particularly from long distance. The duration of his ritual, at times taking longer than a minute, became a point of contention, and was partially responsible for the introduction of a new rule in 2006 (commonly referred to as \"the Lloyd Rule\" after Essendon's Matthew Lloyd, who had a similarly lengthy set-shot ritual), limiting the duration permitted to take a set shot to 30 seconds, before play-on would be called.[7] Fevola's ritual was duly shortened to accommodate the new rule.\n\nIn 2006, Fevola capped off a stunning year and his best to that point by kicking 84 goals and winning the Coleman Medal and All-Australian selection. He scored 59 goals in 2007, then followed this up in 2008 with his career best of 99 goals for the season, seeing him finish second behind Lance Franklin in the race for the Coleman Medal.[5] He was selected for Victoria in the once-off AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match in 2008, kicking six goals and winning the Allen Aylett Medal as best on ground.\n\nIn 2009, Fevola won his second Coleman Medal, kicking 86 goals for the season, eight goals clear of the runner-up Jonathan Brown.[5] He is the only Carlton player ever to win the League goal-kicking twice, and it was his seventh consecutive season as the club's leading goalkicker; only Stephen Kernahan (11) had won the award more times consecutively.[8] He later sold the medal \"to fund a gambling addiction.\"[9]\n\nCarlton announced on 30 September 2009 that it would seek a trade for Fevola during the 2009 trade week due to his off-field behaviour, most specifically due to antics at the 2009 Brownlow Medal Count. On 9 October, he was officially traded to the Brisbane Lions, along with a second round draft pick (#27 overall) in exchange for Brisbane's Lachlan Henderson and a first round draft pick (#12 overall).[10] Additionally, Carlton agreed to pay $100,000 of Fevola's salary for each of the two years remaining on his existing contract.[11] Fevola left Carlton as a life member of the club, after playing 187 senior games for 575 goals \u2013 the third most goals by any player in Carlton Football Club history. Despite the circumstances of his departure, Carlton has stated that Fevola's life membership was not affected, and that he remained welcome at the club.[12]\n\nAt Brisbane, Fevola was given the Number 5 guernsey.[13] He made his debut for the Lions in the first round of the 2010 season at the Gabba against the West Coast Eagles. He finished the 2010 season with 48 goals in 17 games.\n\nAfter further off-field controversy over the 2010/11 offseason, Fevola was sacked by the Lions on 20 February 2011.[14]\n\nOn 6 April 2011, Fevola signed to play with the Casey Scorpions in the Victorian Football League in 2011.[15] He kicked 63 goals during the home and away season, with 43 of those coming in the final six games of the season, to finish second behind Port Melbourne's Patrick Rose (67 goals) in the league goalkicking, and he kicked a further six goals in finals.[16][17] His contract with the Scorpions was not renewed for 2012. He played six games for Waratah in the 2011/12 NTFL season, kicking 49 goals.[18][19]\n\nIn 2012, Fevola signed to play home matches with Yarrawonga in the Ovens & Murray Football League.[20] Interest in Fevola's presence was a significant financial boon for both Yarrawonga and the O&M in 2012, with an increase in attendances and gate takings across the league compared with previous seasons;[21] such was Fevola's ability to draw a crowd that some rival clubs paid Fevola to play against them in Yarrawonga's away matches.[22] Fevola remained at Yarrawonga for four seasons from 2012 until 2015, kicking 357 goals from 65 matches and being part of back-to-back premierships in 2012 and 2013.[23] He was coach of the O&M's interleague representative team in 2014 and 2015,[24] served as a playing co-coach of Yarrawonga in 2015,[25] and holds the record for most goals in a game at Yarrawonga, kicking 16 goals in a match in late 2014.[26] After this, he played with Deer Park in the Western Region Football League in 2016,[23] Melton South in the Ballarat Football League in 2017 and 2018, Hastings in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League in 2019, and then again for Deer Park in 2021 (having also signed there for the 2020 season which was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nThroughout his post-AFL career, Fevola also played once-off matches for several local clubs around the country, earning appearance fees which the clubs financed by the large crowds he could draw.[27] Among the clubs was former TANFL club New Norfolk, now in Tasmania's Southern Football League, where in 2012 he drew a record home crowd for the club and kicked eighteen goals to set a new club record;[28] he returned for another game in 2013, this time kicking sixteen goals.[29]\n\nFevola was a regular panellist on The Footy Show on the Nine Network, and was noted for his larrikin persona. His tenure as a panellist ended after his behaviour at the 2009 Brownlow Medal Count, the same event which led to the end of his time at Carlton.[30]\n\nIn April 2016, Fevola joined Fox FM to host Fifi, Dave, Fev & Byron with Fifi Box, Dave Thornton and Byron Cooke. Dave Thornton resigned from the show in September 2017 and the show was renamed to Fifi, Fev & Byron. In December 2020, Byron Cooke resigned from the show and was replaced by Nick Cody in January 2021. The show was renamed Fifi, Fev & Nick.\n\nAfter gaining some weight following the years after his AFL retirement, he joined Jenny Craig and has become a TV ambassador for the brand as a result of his weight-loss efforts.\n\nFevola starred in the second season of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, which he won and was crowned King of the Jungle. The prize for taking out the title was $100,000 to be donated to his chosen charity. Felova decided to split the winnings evenly between his chosen charity, Shane Warne Foundation, and series runner-up Paul Harragon's chosen charity, Mark Hughes Foundation\n\nFevola married Alex Cheatham on 7 October 2005 at St John's Church in Toorak. Fevola has two daughters, Leni and Lulu, and is also step-father to Mia (Cheatham's child from a previous relationship).[31] In May 2018, Fevola announced on Fox FM's Fifi, Fev & Byron that wife Alex was pregnant with their third child.[32]\n\nOn 12 December 2006 it was announced that they were separated after 14 months of marriage, amid allegations of Fevola's infidelity with an Australian model Lara Bingle.[33] Cheatham stated in a Woman's Day interview that Fevola had become \"disconnected\" from her following the birth of Leni. Bingle later confessed to the five-week affair, claiming that being from Sydney, she did not know that Fevola was married until she heard his baby in the background during a phone conversation.[34]\n\nFevola and Cheatham divorced in 2014; however, in 2016 it was announced that they were again engaged.[31]\n\nFevola opened a restaurant, Fellini, in 2007 on Toorak Road, South Yarra.[35] He sold the restaurant in 2010.[36]\n\nFevola has been noted as studying criminology via correspondence at Griffith University and says that becoming a police officer is a possible career after football.[37][38][39][40][41][42]\n\nFevola has been diagnosed with depression, and he underwent 51 days of extensive rehabilitation in 2011; both his agent and manager have associated many of Fevola's antics with his depression.[43]\n\n\"When Fevola plumbed the depths, there were some who suggested it was like watching a train wreck. Yes, but a train designed by Norman Bel Geddes, a wreck choreographed by Merce Cunningham, and filmed by Guillermo del Toro.\"\n\n\u2014 Chris McAuliffe[44]\n\nIn 2001, he was involved in an attempted theft of jackets from a dry cleaners in North Melbourne; he was fined $8000 by Carlton for the incident.[5] On 8 March 2004, he was involved in an incident at Crown Casino; no charges were laid, but he was suspended by Carlton for a week.[45] In 2006 Fevola assaulted a barman during a tour of Ireland in 2006 with the Australian International Rules team, and was sent back to Australia.[46] In March 2008, Fevola was fined $10,000 by the club and stood down from the leadership group after urinating on a window outside a Melbourne nightclub. After this incident, Carlton did not suspend or delist Fevola, saying that taking such action would not assist Fevola in addressing his problems, but he was put on his final warning.[47]\n\nIn September 2009, Fevola was fined $10,000 and banned from appearing on the Grand Final Footy Show after behaving inappropriately at the 2009 Brownlow Medal count. Fevola withdrew from the traditional lap of honour by the Coleman Medallist at the 2009 AFL Grand Final and did not attend Carlton's award night.[48] As a result of the incident, he was traded to the Brisbane Lions, and did not return as a panellist on The Footy Show in 2010.\n\nOn 2 March 2010, Lara Bingle started proceedings to sue Fevola for breach of privacy, defamation and misuse of her image for the release of a nude photo in Woman's Day released on 1 March 2010;[49] but on 9 April, Fevola was cleared of the charges against him. In September 2010 it was announced that Queensland police had launched a formal investigation into claims that Fevola had flashed a woman at a Brisbane park during a football clinic, but again there were no charges laid;[50] the Brisbane Lions also suspended him independently while it conducted its own investigation into the event.[51]\n\nEarly on 1 January 2011, New Year's Day, Fevola was arrested in Brisbane on charges of public nuisance and obstructing police. He was released on bail and is scheduled to appear in court on 18 January. The Brisbane Lions granted him indefinite leave,[52] before terminating his contract after receiving medical advice.[53]\n\nIn 2010, it became public that Fevola was addicted to gambling, mostly playing poker and punting on horses. He accumulated significant debts from gambling.[54] In a paid interview with the Footy Show in early 2011, Fevola further discussed his addiction, revealing that he spent 65 days in rehabilitation, had lost almost a million dollars gambling, including $365,000 in one day of horse punting, and that his addiction almost drove him to suicide during Christmas 2010.[55] In 2022 Fevola began appearing in commercials for online gambling agency Bet Nation.[56]\n\nFevola's best goalkicking haul in an AFL match was nine goals, scored for Carlton against Richmond in 2009. Prior to this, he had scored eight goals on eight separate occasions. In his one season with the Brisbane Lions, Fevola's highest tally was 5.2 (32).\n\nIn AFL matches outside the premiership season, Fevola's best effort was a haul of twelve goals, scored for Carlton against Collingwood in the 2000 pre-season match known as the Millennium Match; and, he had two other eight-goal hauls in pre-season matches: the 2005 Wizard Cup grand final against West Coast, earning him the Michael Tuck Medal, and in the semi-final of the 2007 NAB Cup against North Melbourne. He scored hauls of eleven and ten goals in matches for Casey during the 2011 VFL season, against Frankston and the Northern Bullants respectively.[16]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Fevola"}, {"id": 47, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/38/743337/original/claude-mak-l-l-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/claude-mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9/743337", "desc": "Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 Sinda (French pronunciation: \u200b[klod makelele]; born 18 February 1973) is a French football manager and former professional player who played as a defensive midfielder.

He won league titles in France, Spain and England, as well as the 2001\u201302 UEFA Champions League during his time with Real Madrid.[6]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was a French international for 13 years, and was part of the France national team which reached the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He also represented his nation at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, two UEFA European Championships and the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest players in his position, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 has been credited with redefining the defensive midfield role in English football, especially during the 2004\u201305 FA Premier League season, where he played a key role in helping Chelsea win the title with 95 points. In homage, the defensive midfield position is sometimes colloquially known as the \"Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 Role\".[7][8]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was born in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). \"Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9\" means \"noises\" in Lingala,[9] one of the languages spoken in the country. He moved to Savigny-le-Temple, a suburb of Paris in Seine-et-Marne, in 1977, when he was four years old. His father, Andr\u00e9-Joseph Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, was also a football player. He represented DR Congo, and ended his career in the third division of Belgium with Union Royale Namur.[10]\n\nAt age 15, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 signed for Sporting Melun-Dammarie 77. He played one year there, and left at the age of 16, when he joined the training centre of Brest-Armorique in Brittany. According to him,[citation needed] it was not easy to adapt to the new life in Brest. The training academy life was tough, especially as it was the first time he was far from his family.[citation needed]\n\nHe worked very hard in Brest, but it was in the city of Nantes where he discovered the real pleasure of playing. Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was recruited by FC Nantes in December 1991, when he was still 18\u00a0years old. Robert Budzynski, Nantes' sporting director, confessed that once he had discovered Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 in Brest, he was sure he would become the new Emmanuel Petit.[11]\n\nAt the beginning of the 1992\u201393 season, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was already in the Nantes first-team, then playing in the French first division. He played at Nantes for five seasons, winning the French championship in 1995 and helped the club to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League the following season. This earned him a move to Marseille for whom he played for one season.[12]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was transferred to Celta Vigo where he spent two successful seasons at the Galician club. While playing alongside Aleksandr Mostovoi, Valeri Karpin, Haim Revivo and M\u00edchel Salgado, Celta achieved historic victories such as 4\u20131 against Liverpool and 4\u20130 against Juventus in the UEFA Cup.[13]\n\n\u2026we knew that Zidane, Ra\u00fal, and Figo didn't track back, so we had to put a guy in front of the back four who would defend.\n\nArrigo Sacchi describes Real Madrid's need for a holding midfielder.[14]\n\nIn 2000, he was recruited by Real Madrid. His transfer was controversial because Celta did not want to sell Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 unless a substantial improvement on their offer was made. Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 refused to train until there was resolution of his contract. Finally, Celta were reluctantly forced to sell him for \u20ac14 million, far less than their valuation of the player and only after a falsified police report was made by his agent, Marc Roger.[15]\n\nAt Real, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 substantially added to his medal tally, winning two Spanish La Liga championships, the Champions League, the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, the UEFA Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup. As an ever-present in Vicente del Bosque's Real Madrid side, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 also established himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world.[12]\n\nDespite his value to the team, however, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was one of its most (relatively) under-paid members, earning a fraction of that paid to teammates like Zinedine Zidane, Lu\u00eds Figo, Ra\u00fal, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Steve McManaman, and Guti. In the summer of 2003, feeling that his position at the club was insecure after the shock sacking of Del Bosque and the arrival of David Beckham, and encouraged by teammates Zidane, Ra\u00fal, McManaman and Fernando Morientes, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 decided to ask for an improved contract. The Real management flatly refused to consider his request.[16] Upset, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 handed in a transfer request, whereupon he was signed by Chelsea. Club president Florentino P\u00e9rez infamously poured scorn on Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9's footballing abilities and proclaimed that Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 would not be missed:\n\nHe wasn't a header of the ball and he rarely passed the ball more than three metres. Younger players will arrive who will cause Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 to be forgotten.[17]\nIn his autobiography, published in 2006, McManaman described Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 as the most important and yet least appreciated midfielder at Real. Retired former Real Madrid player and captain Fernando Hierro also criticised P\u00e9rez for both Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9's departure and the manner of his departure, saying:\n\nI think Claude has this kind of gift \u2013 he's been the best player in the team for years but people just don't notice him, don't notice what he does. But you ask anyone at Real Madrid during the years we were talking about and they will tell you he was the best player at Real. We all knew, the players all knew he was the most important. The loss of Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was the beginning of the end for Los Galacticos. You can see that it was also the beginning of a new dawn for Chelsea. He was the base, the key and I think he is the same to Chelsea now.[18]\nIn the summer of 2003, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 signed for Chelsea for \u00a316.8 million, where then manager Claudio Ranieri proclaimed that Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 would be the \"battery\" of the team.[19]\n\nChelsea finished second in the 2003\u201304 FA Premier League and were eliminated by Monaco in the semi-finals of the 2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League.[20]\n\nFollowing the sacking of Ranieri and his succession by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was a key player in Chelsea's successful 2004\u201305 season, winning both the FA Premier League and the League Cup. His defensive qualities allowed the likes of Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Arjen Robben, Damien Duff, Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen and Didier Drogba to parade their attacking skills. Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9's importance was recognised by Mourinho, who declared him Chelsea's \"Player of the Year\".[21]\n\nTo cap off the 2004\u201305 season for the Frenchman, he was allowed to take a penalty awarded to Chelsea in the game against Charlton Athletic on the day the Premier League trophy was due to be presented. Charlton goalkeeper Stephan Andersen saved it, but Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 scored on the rebound.[22] In September 2005, he was selected as a member of the World XI at the FIFPro awards. The team was chosen by a vote of professional footballers in 40 countries. He added to his sizeable medal haul the following season, winning both the FA Community Shield and the Premier League.[23]\n\nIn March 2006, Fulham defeated Chelsea 1\u20130 in a Premier League game in which Fulham manager Chris Coleman's tactics centered on bypassing Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 on the wings when Fulham had possession and putting midfielders on Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 when Chelsea were in possession. With Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 struggling to function effectively, Chelsea lost the game. Coleman later explained that Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was more than a mere defensive midfielder; that he was actually Chelsea's deep-lying playmaker, and that Chelsea's attacks were channelled through him. Thus, denying him possession was instrumental in unravelling Chelsea. Mourinho was subsequently forced to counter this tactic by withdrawing Lampard and Michael Essien further back in midfield to relieve the pressure on Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9.[24]\n\nOn 5 November 2006, in a league encounter with Tottenham Hotspur, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 scored his second goal for the club, a difficult curling volley from the edge of the 18-yard box which sped past goalkeeper Paul Robinson into the left-hand side of the goal to cue a bench-clearing celebration.[25] Although Tottenham sprang a comeback to beat Chelsea 2\u20131, this goal got him the best shot to goals percentage that year with one shot and one goal \u2013 100%.[citation needed]\n\nOn 5 December 2006, in a League Cup game against Newcastle United, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 wore the captain's armband in John Terry's absence and with Frank Lampard rested. He was substituted at half-time for Lampard. Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 also wore the captain's armband the following season, when Terry, Lampard, and Michael Ballack were all unavailable. Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was captain even when Terry and Lampard returned for a crucial Champions League tie against Olympiacos, but Terry returned as captain the following weekend for the League Cup defeat against Tottenham.[citation needed]\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season was a period of renaissance for the 35-year-old Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, as he played in the majority of Chelsea's fixtures. Despite an ear infection that made him miss an early part of the season, he regained his place and forced Michael Essien into the right-back position, effectively pushing Juliano Belletti out of the team. Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was instrumental in Chelsea's run to the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final under the guidance of manager Avram Grant; the team were defeated by Manchester United in a penalty-shootout, after a 1\u20131 deadlock following both regulation and extra time.[26]\n\nOn 18 July 2008, it was reported that Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was about to take a medical the following day in Paris ahead of a proposed move back to French football. On 21 July, Chelsea announced they had released Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 on a free transfer, while Paris Saint-Germain confirmed that the player would join them and would be unveiled at a press conference that afternoon.[27][28]\n\nOn 25 February 2010, he announced that he would retire at the end of the season, but in June, he retracted his statement and re-signed with PSG for an additional season.[29] He won the Coupe de France with PSG at the end of the 2009\u201310 season. He later retired at the end of the campaign. The next season, he was appointed the assistant manager to Carlo Ancelotti, who had just joined PSG from Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9's previous club, Chelsea.[30]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was first capped for France in a match against Norway in July 1995,[31] and went on to represent his country at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[citation needed]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was not selected for France's 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 successes, making his tournament debut at the 2002 World Cup, where he started the team's final Group A match against Denmark. At Euro 2004, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was a first-choice player in midfield, starting in three of France's four matches.[32][33][34]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 decided to retire from international football in September 2004 in order to focus on club football with Chelsea, but 11 months later, in August 2005, he and compatriots Zinedine Zidane and Lilian Thuram were persuaded out of retirement to help France qualify for the 2006 World Cup in Germany.[35]\n\nAs a member of the France squad competing at the 2006 World Cup, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9's performances as a tireless midfield spoiler were invaluable to France's progress to the final as they defeated Spain, the defending champions Brazil and Euro 2004 finalists Portugal in the knock-out rounds. His partnership with Patrick Vieira in the defensive midfield proved effective as the team conceded only three goals in seven games and took four clean-sheets, a tally only bested by world champions Italy.[36]\n\nAfter a defeat to Italy on penalties in the World Cup Final, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 initially commented that he was again going to retire from international football. However, he was called up to the squad by France national team manager Raymond Domenech for qualification matches for Euro 2008 against Georgia and Italy. On being asked about Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 being called up to his national squad despite being retired during an interview on Sky Sports, Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho accused France national coach Domenech of treating Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 like a slave and refusing to honour his retirement. Mourinho said Domenech \"has been very objective \u2013 very objective \u2013 and said you have to play Georgia and you have to play Italy. Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 wants to retire but the national coach won't allow him to retire.\"[37] FIFA confirmed that any club that refuses to release a player for national team duty is barred from using the player for two matches, a rule which is intended to discourage clubs from pretending that the player is injured.[38] On the same evening as the Mourinho interview, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 told French TV station TPS Star, \"Even if my club doesn't agree, I will humbly honor the call.\"[37]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 went on to continue playing with the France national team through the qualifications and then the finals for the Euro 2008 tournament, where France exited in the group stage after finishing bottom of their group. He and Thuram announced their retirement from international football on 17 June 2008, after France's 2\u20130 defeat to Italy.[39]\n\nRegarded as one of the best players ever in his position, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 revolutionised the role of the defensive midfielder in the Premier League; as such, this position frequently came to be known colloquially as \"the Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 role\" in England. A combative and hard-working player, although he was capable of getting forward and playing in more advanced positions, he usually played in front of his team's back-line, where he mainly served as a defensive foil for his more offensive teammates, due to his aggressive tackling, as well as his ability to read the game, break down plays, mark and anticipate opponents, and time his challenges. In this role, he was known in particular for his acceleration, positional sense, tactical discipline, intelligence, energy, and ball-winning ability; although he was not the fastest, most talented, technically skilled player on the ball, or particularly good in the air, he was also highly regarded throughout his career for being capable of functioning as a deep-lying playmaker for his team, due to his ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play in midfield with his short, efficient passing game, which allowed him to link up the defence with the attack effectively after winning back possession. His physical strength in spite of his small stature, combined with his low centre of gravity, also gave him excellent balance on the ball in limited spaces, which allowed him to retain possession against more physical opponents. In addition to his defensive skills, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was also known for his tenacity, awareness, consistency, and strong mentality.[7][8][14][17][18][19][40][41][42][43][44] Jonathan Wilson, when writing for The Guardian in 2013, labelled Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 as a type of holding midfielder he described as a \"destroyer,\" a player who is primarily tasked with running, winning back possession, and distributing the ball to other players.[45]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 became head coach of Bastia on 24 May 2014. After less than six months in charge, however, he was sacked on 3 November 2014 following a 1\u20130 defeat to Guingamp on 1 November, due to his inability to make an impact on the club as coach.[46] Prior to Bastia, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was an assistant coach at Paris Saint-Germain alongside Paul Clement. In January 2016, Monaco appointed Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 as technical director.[47] Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 joined Clement as his assistant coach at Premier League club Swansea City in January 2017.[48]\n\nMak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 then joined Belgian side Eupen as their head coach in November 2017.[49] He left Eupen in August 2019 after almost 2 full seasons as head coach to return to his former club Chelsea as a youth coach and technical mentor.[5]\n\nIn the spring of 2004, Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 began dating French model No\u00e9mie Lenoir. Lenoir gave birth to a boy, Kelyan (born 24 January 2005). The couple split in early 2009. Despite widespread reports that Lenoir was married to Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, she wrote a blog in 2009 clarifying their former relationship, saying, \"I'm not and have never been married. I do have a son. I have a wonderful baby's father and have a great relationship with him, however I've been single for some time now.\"[50] In May 2010, Lenoir attempted to commit suicide outside Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9's Paris home by ingesting a lethal amount of drugs and alcohol. Reports after the suicide attempt implied that it was related to Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 finally calling it quits with Lenoir and moving on with his then pregnant fianc\u00e9e, which he vehemently denies. Lenoir has had a long battle with substance abuse and later checked into rehab.[51]\n\nNantes\n\nReal Madrid[54]\n\nChelsea[53]\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nFrance\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Mak%C3%A9l%C3%A9l%C3%A9"}, {"id": 48, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/53/1044220/original/gareth-rees-athletes-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Gareth Rees", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/gareth-rees/1044220", "desc": "Gareth Lloyd Rees (born June 30, 1967 in Duncan, British Columbia) is a former Canadian international rugby union footballer who played at fly-half and full back positions.

Paynter asked Tucker if he would play on loan to Athenian League side Finchley against Leyton the following Saturday and after that game, despite a 3\u20130 loss, both West Ham and Finchley were after him. Finchley offered him \u00a311 a week, including \u00a35 from the chairman's personal funds, and Tucker accepted this.

Fry, who described him as \"the best-looking man of my acquaintance\" and one of the players whose presence in the Corinthians' side contributed to \"their reputation up North as a team of toffs\".[citation needed]\n\nGosling's bearing lent him an imposing presence on the football field. He looked, Wall recalled, \"every inch the high-born... [his] carriage and gait would have done credit to a court Chamberlain at a levee\", and was admirably built, being merely \"bone and muscle, not soft flesh\".

He is the son of Dudley and Dora McCarthy and has two brothers and a sister.[7] His older brother is Jerome McCarthy, a former professional footballer who played for Kaizer Chiefs and Manning Rangers, among other clubs, while his younger brother Mark played football at Franklin Pierce University in the United States.[7]\n\nMcCarthy began playing at a local side called Young Pirates, which was managed by his uncles. He then joined the youth structures of a local amateur club called Crusaders. At age 17, he was signed by first division club Seven Stars.[8]\n\nPlaying for Seven Stars, the 18-year-old McCarthy scored 1 goal in 29 matches in the 1995\u201396 season, followed by another 12 goals in 20 matches, which earned him a transfer to Cape Town Spurs, which two years later merged with Seven Stars to form Dutch club Ajax's feeder team, Ajax Cape Town.\n\nIn 1997, after an impressive showing at the African Youth Championship and FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia, he joined Ajax in the Eredivisie, where he scored nine goals and was crowned champion in his first season. After a relatively successful 1998\u201399 season, he was sold to Spanish side Celta de Vigo for a transfer fee reported to be over \u20ac6\u00a0million, at the time the most expensive transfer for a South African player.\n\nAlthough regarded as one of the best African players at the time, McCarthy never established himself as a regular choice for Celta's manager, V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez. After two poor seasons at the Galician club, he was loaned to struggling Porto in the 2001\u201302 season, where he soon rediscovered the form that took him to Europe.\n\nAt Porto, McCarthy played under the then newly appointed coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho for an underperforming team that since winning the European Cup in 1987 had never been quite good enough to challenge for the top honours in Europe. However, that would soon change.\n\nAfter representing Bafana Bafana in the 2002 African Nations Cup, where his national side was eliminated in the quarter-finals, McCarthy returned to Porto, where he became the main force behind the team's recovery. He helped them to third place in the Primeira Liga and automatic qualification for the UEFA Cup by scoring an impressive 12 goals in 11 matches, but Porto's finances did not allow them to keep the player, despite the desire of both sides to continue.\n\nIn 2002\u201303, McCarthy therefore returned to Celta, where he spent much of his time on the substitutes' bench as a squad player as Porto captured the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, the Portuguese League and the UEFA Cup. When Porto sold striker H\u00e9lder Postiga to Tottenham Hotspur ahead of the 2003\u201304 season, Porto finally acquired McCarthy for a sum of \u20ac7.856\u00a0million,[9] (later re-sold part of the rights to GestiFute and First Portuguese Football Players Fund.)\n\nFor the 2003\u201304 Primeira Liga season, he earned the Golden Boot award (with 20 goals in 23 matches) on the season's final matchday with a hat-trick, and was instrumental in Porto's run in the 2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League, which they won. He scored two goals against Manchester United to defeat them in the second round.\n\nOn 25 July 2006, McCarthy flew out to England to undergo a medical and probable contract signing to join Blackburn Rovers.[10] Three days later, he signed a four-year contract with Blackburn for a \u00a32.5\u00a0million transfer fee. The move meant that Rovers regularly fielded a side that contained two South African Internationals, the other being Aaron Mokoena who joined the club the year previous. \n\nAfter a disappointing performance in the side's 3\u20130 defeat to Portsmouth, McCarthy found the net on his debut at Ewood Park against Everton on 23 August 2006. McCarthy further endeared himself to Rovers fans, scoring a goal on his European debut for the club in a 2\u20132 against Red Bull Salzburg in the UEFA Cup, and scoring another in the return leg. He finished second top scorer in the Premier League in 2006\u201307 with 18 league goals, as well as 24 in all competitions.\n\nThe following season got off to a poor start for McCarthy when he was stretchered off in the Premier League opening day win against Middlesbrough. McCarthy was out of action for a few weeks and found first team opportunities limited, largely because the form of new striking arrival Roque Santa Cruz. Despite being limited to largely substitute appearances, McCarthy did find the net 11 times in all competitions.\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 season, McCarthy appeared to be out of favour with new manager Paul Ince, as the club's strike force was strengthened with the arrivals of Carlos Villanueva and Robbie Fowler to join the already established Roque Santa Cruz, Jason Roberts and Matt Derbyshire. However, McCarthy answered these critics by scoring his first goal of the campaign \u2013 a 94th-minute equaliser in a Premier League match against Middlesbrough.\n\nIn all competitions for Blackburn, McCarthy scored 52 goals in 140 matches.\n\nMcCarthy completed a move to West Ham United for an undisclosed fee on transfer deadline day, 1 February 2010. He signed a two and a half-year contract that was due to run until the summer of 2012. He made his Premier League debut for West Ham against Burnley at Turf Moor in a 2\u20131 defeat on 6 February 2010, where he sustained an injury which would keep him out for six weeks.[11] In February 2011, having played just 326 minutes of football, making only three starts and failing to score any goals for West Ham, McCarthy was omitted from West Ham's 25-man squad for the remainder of the 2010\u201311 season. He was also offered a \u00a31\u00a0million pay-off in exchange for terminating his contract prematurely.[12][13] In April 2011, McCarthy left West Ham by mutual agreement after the parties agreed to terminate his contract.\n[14] He made only two Premier League starts and fourteen appearances in all competitions scoring no goals.[15]\n\nAfter leaving West Ham, McCarthy trained with former club Ajax Cape Town during the ABSA Premier League off-season. On 2 August, Orlando Pirates confirmed the signing of McCarthy on a two-year deal, ending his 14-year spell in Europe. On signing, McCarthy said, \"I'm thrilled and delighted and hope I can show my appreciation by coming in and playing good football and hope to score as many goals as possible to put the team where they belong.\"\n[16] McCarthy began the season by scoring on debut and vowed to score more goals.\n\nMcCarthy scored two goals in the final half-hour to help the Pirates defeat the Golden Arrows 4\u20132 on 19 May 2012 to retain their Premier League title.[17] He finished his successful season with ten league goals, ending the campaign as the fourth leading goal-scorer in the Premier League, helping the club secure their second successive treble. Having already won a league championship with Ajax in the Netherlands as well with Porto both domestically and in Europe, McCarthy would make football history by winning the league championship with Orlando Pirates in South Africa. This meant McCarthy was the first South African footballer to win three league titles with three different football clubs on two different continents.[18]\n\nMcCarthy, who is affectionately known as \"Big Brother\" by the Orlando Pirates faithful, was handed a red card for dissent in the MTN 8 secondleg semi-final played on 25 August 2012 after he charged Franklin Cale after a reckless challenge on Daine Klate. This incident lead to protesting fans whom, in their view, Cale was equally guilty in the incident and should have also been shown red. McCarthy announced his retirement from professional football on 6 June 2013, aged 35.[19]\n\nOn 13 July 2014, McCarthy made a guest appearance for Scottish Lowland league club Whitehill Welfare in a pre-season friendly against a Hamilton Academical XI, scoring in the 14th minute and providing an assist for Whitehill Welfare player Kerr Dodds to score in the 20th minute.[20][21] McCarthy has a connection with the club through one of the Whitehill players, John Hall.[22]\n\nMcCarthy made his full international debut for South Africa in a friendly against the Netherlands on 4 June 1997.\n\nAlong with veteran Egyptian striker Hossam Hassan, McCarthy was the joint top scorer in the 1998 African Cup of Nations in Burkina Faso with seven goals, including four in 13 minutes against Namibia. In addition, he was named Player of the Tournament.\n\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup in France was the first time South Africa's national football team had reached the later stages of the competition, and McCarthy was one of their key players. After a 3\u20130 defeat against eventual champions France, South Africa played their second match against Denmark. Trailing since the 13th minute, McCarthy tied the game at 1\u20131 in the 52nd minute and gave South Africa a chance for qualification after a 1\u20131 draw. However, the third match also ended in a draw, against Saudi Arabia, which left the South Africans in third place and eliminated from the competition.\n\nThe 2002 World Cup saw history repeating for the South Africans. After a 2\u20132 draw against Paraguay and a 1\u20130 victory over Slovenia, McCarthy's 30th-minute equaliser in the last match against Spain was not enough, as South Africa eventually lost 3\u20132 and finished with another third place in the group stage.\n\nThere was often conflict over McCarthy's lack of participation in national team matches (whose interests often collide with his club's) and he actually retired from international matches after the 2002 World Cup. However, he returned to the national team in 2004 and eventually set the record for most international goals for South Africa; McCarthy's strike in the second half of a 3\u20130 win against Paraguay in a 2008 friendly eclipsed the previous record of 29 goals held by Shaun Bartlett.\n\nPrior to the 2010 World Cup, held in South Africa, McCarthy announced his support for the Gun-Free World Cup campaign being run by International Action Network on Small Arms. He said, \"This World Cup will be the biggest in football history and the fact that it is taking place in South Africa is a chance for us to show the world everything that is good about our country. It's great that guns will be banned from stadiums \u2013 it's going to be a fantastic party, and guns have no place in that.\"[23] After struggling with his fitness and facing criticism in his nation for being overweight, McCarthy was omitted from the final South African 23-man squad for the 2010 World Cup, which was announced on 1 June 2010.[24]\n\nLiving in Edinburgh since 2013, McCarthy confirmed in April 2015, that he had joined the coaching staff of Alan Stubbs at Scottish club Hibernian.[25] Stubbs had invited McCarthy so he could just learn the coaching side of things. McCarthy knew Stubbs back from their playing days when McCarthy was at Blackburn Rovers and Stubbs was at Everton. McCarthy said, that he was going to help out with the U20s, and assisting with the first team.\n\nIn February 2015, he did a short internship at Sint-Truidense VV club under Yannick Ferrera. On 8 September 2015, McCarthy was appointed assistant manager to manager Chris O'Loughlin, who replaced Yannick Ferrera.[26] Working his way through the different tiers of the UEFA Coaching Badges system, McCarthy met O'Loughlin.\n\nOn 20 April 2016, McCarthy stopped working with Sint-Truiden for personal reasons, after it was previously announced that his contract was not renewed.[27]\n\nOn 13 June 2017, McCarthy was unveiled as the new Cape Town City head coach,[28] replacing Eric Tinkler, who moved to manage SuperSport United. \nMcCarthy would complete his UEFA Pro License while coaching City, and would win his first silverware as a coach in 2018 when he guided City to the MTN 8 cup.[29] \nOn 4 November 2019, McCarthy was dismissed as head coach of Cape Town City after just two wins in 18 games .\n\nOn 14 December 2020, McCarthy was unveiled as the new AmaZulu F.C. head coach, replacing Ayanda Dlamini, who stepped down from the position on 7 December 2020. He took the club to a second-place finish in the DStv Premiership, a record high for AmaZulu in the modern era of the game in South Africa. As a result, AmaZulu qualified for the preliminary rounds of the 2021\u201322 CAF Champions League. McCarthy led AmaZulu to the group stages of the 2021\u201322 CAF Champions League in their debut season before exiting the competition. McCarthy and AmaZulu parted company on 25 March 2022.[30]\n\nOn 30 July 2022, McCarthy was appointed as a first-team coach at Manchester United.[31]\n\nIn 2004, McCarthy married Maria Santos from Spain. They have three daughters together: Minna, Mya and Allegra. In 2007, they separated.[32] In May 2014, McCarthy married Scottish model Stacey Munro. Together, they have one daughter, Lima Rose[33] and one son, Lio Romero, born in 2019.[34]\n\nAs of 18 September 2021\n\nAjax\n\nCelta\n\nPorto\n\nOrlando Pirates\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIndividual\n\nCape Town City\n\nIn 1998, McCarthy collaborated with South African kwaito music group TKZee in \"Shibobo\". The song released in the run-up to the 1998 World Cup in France samples greatly on \"The Final Countdown\" by Europe and features McCarthy rapping part of the lyrics. He also appears in the football-themed music video for the song. Sales of the single topped the 100,000 mark in just over a month in South Africa, making \"Shibobo\" the fastest and biggest selling CD single by TKZee or other South African recording artists. The song was also a hit in other African music charts. The song enjoyed a comeback in a re-release in 2010\u201311.\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benni_McCarthy"}, {"id": 53, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/76/1514946/original/marcelo-salas-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Marcelo Salas", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/marcelo-salas/1514946", "desc": "Jos\u00e9 Marcelo Salas Melinao (American Spanish: [ma\u027e\u02c8selo \u02c8salas]; born 24 December 1974), dubbed as El Matador (due to his goalscoring celebrations), El Fen\u00f3meno, and Shileno, is a retired Chilean footballer who played as a striker.\nHe has played in Chile, Argentina and Italy, winning titles with each club with whom he has played, and was voted South American Footballer of the Year in 1997.

He also gained 17 England caps between 1995 and 1999, and was a member of England\u2019s squad that reached the semi finals of Euro 1996.[8] His 11 years at Liverpool were the most prolific, playing more than 237 league games for the club, including a spell as captain, and being involved in winning the 1995 Football League Cup final.\n\nIn a career that was blighted by a succession of injuries, Redknapp was as famous for his media profile off the field as much as on it.[9] He married the pop singer Louise in 1998. Redknapp comes from a well-known footballing family. His father is the football manager Harry Redknapp. He is also a cousin of Frank Lampard, and a nephew of former West Ham United coach Frank Lampard, Sr.[10]\n\nRedknapp was born in Barton on Sea, Hampshire and started his career at Tottenham Hotspur as a youth player but turned down their offer of a contract, deciding to play for AFC Bournemouth under his father, manager Harry Redknapp. He went on to play for Liverpool where Redknapp would be remembered for his best performances.

He was one of the most expensively signed teenagers in English football around this time.\n\nRedknapp was one of the last players to be signed by manager Kenny Dalglish before his surprising resignation on 22 February 1991 and later became the youngest Liverpool player[11] to appear in European competition, at 18 years 120 days when making his Liverpool debut against Auxerre in the UEFA Cup on 23 October 1991, by which time Liverpool were being managed by Graeme Souness. This record was broken by Phil Charnock thirteen months later.[12]\n\nRedknapp's first goal for Liverpool came in his league debut on 7 December 1991 when he featured as a 63rd-minute substitute for Jan M\u00f8lby in a 1\u20131 draw with Southampton at the Dell.\n\nFollowing Dalglish's departure, Redknapp was part of a transitional Liverpool team under Graeme Souness. He spent most of his first two-and-a-half years as a substitute or in the reserves, missing the 1992 FA Cup final triumph and only becoming a regular first-team player in the 1993\u201394 season, at the expense of Mark Walters. At this time, Redknapp had also become one of the mass-marketed poster boy icons of the newly developing FA Premier League where, alongside other photogenic young players like Manchester United players Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe, he was used ceaselessly in commercials, advertising spots and for the league's promotional purposes in merchandising and sales, with the result being that football stars had become idols on par with rock stars and pop stars,[13] by and around the mid to late 1990s.\n\nRedknapp's contributions peaked during the 1998\u201399 season as he created numerous chances and scored 10 goals under new boss G\u00e9rard Houllier. Redknapp became vice- and then full club captain by 1999\u20132000 following the departures of John Barnes, Steve McManaman and Paul Ince.\n\nHis contributions helped the club back into the top three of the FA Premiership but a knee injury curtailed his involvement in the 2000\u201301 season and in a bid to cure long-standing injury troubles he underwent knee surgery under renowned knee specialist Dr Richard Steadman in the United States. As a result, Redknapp was unable to participate in the whole of the club's cup treble campaign which yielded the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Although injured, as the club captain he was called up by his teammates to receive the FA Cup with vice-captain Robbie Fowler at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. He made his comeback from injury during the pre-season tour before the 2001\u201302 season.\n\nRedknapp's return did not last long as he was again struck by injury. On 27 October 2001 he played and scored in a 2\u20130 win over Charlton Athletic at The Valley,[14] and then 3 days later he played what would prove to be his last game for the Merseyside club against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.[15][16] He had played 308 times for the Reds and scored 41 goals, becoming a favourite amongst Liverpool fans, who included him at number 40 in the 2006 poll 100 Players Who Shook The Kop.[17][18]\n\nRedknapp was allowed to join Glenn Hoddle's Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer on 18 April 2002 with just a couple of fixtures remaining of the 2001\u201302 season. He made his debut at the beginning of the following campaign when he played on 17 August 2002 in the 2\u20132 league draw with his former club Liverpool's rival Everton at Goodison Park. Redknapp's pass into the path of Matthew Etherington allowed Etherington to score his first ever Premiership goal.[19]\n\nRedknapp scored his first goal for the club a week later on 26 August 2002 in the 1\u20130 league win over Aston Villa at White Hart Lane. Redknapp played 49 times for Spurs scoring 4 goals in his two-and-a-half years with the club before becoming his father Harry's first signing for Southampton on 4 January 2005.\n\nThe 31-year-old joined Southampton's fight against relegation on a free transfer and made his debut on 5 January 2005 in the 3\u20133 league draw with Fulham at St Mary's. Redknapp's only goal for the club came three days later in the 3\u20131 FA Cup 3rd round victory over Northampton Town at Sixfields Stadium.[20]\n\nRedknapp was rarely fully fit during his brief spell at the Saints and was not able to prevent them from being relegated to the Championship after 27 successive seasons of top flight football.\n\nAt the end of the season, on 19 June 2005, the 31-year-old Redknapp decided to retire from the game due to his constant injury problems and on the advice of his medical specialists.\n\nEngland manager Terry Venables gave Redknapp his international debut on 6 September 1995 in the 0\u20130 international friendly with Colombia at Wembley.[21] The game is probably best remembered for his mishit cross that produced Ren\u00e9 Higuita's famous 'scorpion kick'.[22] It ranked 94th in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments in 2002.[23]\n\nRedknapp was capped 17 times for England but played just 39 minutes at a major tournament, which was during the Euro 96 campaign when he appeared as a substitute against Scotland in the group stage. Rob Smyth later wrote in The Guardian that Redknapp's \"slick passing greased some slow-moving wheels\".[24] Injury ruled him out of contention for both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000.[25][26]\n\nHis only international goal came on 10 October 1999 in the 2\u20131 friendly victory against Belgium at the Stadium of Light, Sunderland.[21]\n\nOn 21 September 2007, Chelsea reportedly approached Redknapp to become Avram Grant's assistant, as Chelsea's owner billionaire Roman Abramovich looked to shake up Stamford Bridge's coaching staff, though no appointment was forthcoming.[citation needed]\n\nOn 11 December 2008, it was announced Jamie Redknapp would become coach of Chelsea reserves two days a week whilst studying for his UEFA coaching badges. The vacancy arose after former Chelsea reserves coach Brendan Rodgers was hired by Championship outfit Watford.[27]\n\nRedknapp began his career in 2004 as a studio-based pundit on BBC during the European Championships. Since retiring he had gone into punditry full-time and is a regular studio pundit on Sky Sports alongside former England teammate Gary Neville. He is also a regular columnist on the Sky Sports website.[28]\n\nIn 2005, Redknapp launched a bi-monthly magazine with his wife Louise and former teammate Tim Sherwood named Icon Magazine, aimed at professional footballers and their families.[29]\n\nIn 2010, he was made host and mentor on the Sky1 show Football's Next Star, and a team captain in the Sky1 sports game show A League of Their Own.[citation needed]\n\nRedknapp has received significant attention for his repeated overuse and misuse of the word \"literally\", in quotes such as \"he literally chopped him in half in that challenge\", \"Alonso and Sissoko have been picked to literally sit in front of the back four\", \"Drogba literally destroyed Senderos today\", \"in his youth, Michael Owen was literally a greyhound\", \"he had to cut back inside onto his left, because he literally hasn't got a right foot\", \"Martin Jol's head is literally on the chopping block\" and \"these balls now \u2013 they literally explode off your feet\".[30][31] In 2010, he was presented with the Foot in Mouth Award from the Plain English Campaign for his poor use of English.[citation needed]\n\nOn 22 April 2021, chat show Redknapp's Big Night Out premieried on Sky One, presented by Jamie and Harry Redknapp with comedian Tom Davis.[32]\n\nRedknapp's father is football manager Harry Redknapp, and his mother is Sandra Harris. He has one older brother, Mark, who is a model.[33] He is the maternal cousin of Frank Lampard, whose father is former West Ham United player and Harry's former managerial assistant Frank Lampard, Sr.\n\nRedknapp grew up on the south coast as his father was coaching Bournemouth at that time. He attended Twynham School in Christchurch and started playing in the Sunday league youth teams with his brother.[34][35]\n\nOn 29 June 1998, Redknapp married the pop singer Louise Nurding, a member of the girl group Eternal. On 27 July 2004, Louise gave birth to a boy named Charles William \"Charley\" Redknapp at London's Portland Hospital. Charley was named after Louise's grandfather, who died on the day that she found out she was pregnant.[36] On 10 November 2008, Louise gave birth to their second son, Beau Henry Redknapp. Louise revealed the name was a tribute to Jamie's father, Harry, who was born in Bow, London.[37] The family lived in Oxshott, Surrey.[38] After 19 years of marriage, Jamie and Louise Redknapp were granted a divorce on 29 December 2017.[39]\n\nOn 18 October 2021, Redknapp married model Frida Andersson, at Chelsea Register Office in London.[40] The couple welcomed their first child on 24 November 2021, a boy named Raphael.[41][42]\n\nLiverpool[43]\n\nEngland U21[45]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Redknapp"}, {"id": 55, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/31/603214/original/bobby-moore-photo-u14?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Bobby Moore", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/bobby-moore/603214", "desc": "Robert Frederick Chelsea Moore OBE (12 April 1941 \u2013 24 February 1993) was an English professional footballer.

He most notably played for West Ham United, captaining the club for more than ten years, and was the captain of the England national team that won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders in the history of football, and was cited by Pel\u00e9 as the greatest defender that he had ever played against.[5]\n\nWidely regarded as West Ham's greatest ever player, Moore played over 600 games for the club during a 16-year tenure, winning the FA Cup in 1963\u201364 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1964\u201365. During his time at the club, he won the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1964 and the West Ham Player of the Year in 1961, 1963, 1968 and 1970. In August 2008, West Ham United officially retired his number 6 shirt, 15 years after his death.[6]\n\nMoore was made captain of England in 1964, at age 23, going on to lift the World Cup trophy in 1966. He won a total of 108 caps for his country, which at the time of his international retirement in 1973 was a national record. This record was later broken by Peter Shilton. Moore's total of 108 caps continued as a record for an outfield player until 28 March 2009, when David Beckham gained his 109th cap.[7] Moore is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century. A national team icon, a bronze statue of Moore stands at the entrance to Wembley Stadium.\n\nA composed central defender, Moore was best known for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Receiving the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1966, he was the first footballer to win the award and he remained the only one for a further 24 years. Moore was given an OBE in the New Year Honours List. He was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player and in the same year he was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons.\n\nMoore was born in Upney Hospital on Saturday, 12 April 1941 in Barking, Essex, son of Robert E. Moore and Doris (n\u00e9e Buckle). He attended Westbury Primary School Barking then Tom Hood School, Leytonstone, playing football for both.[8]\n\nIn 1956, Moore joined West Ham United as a player and, after advancing through their youth set-up, he played his first game on 8 September 1958 against Manchester United.[9] In putting on the number six shirt, he replaced his mentor Malcolm Allison, who was suffering from tuberculosis.\n\nAt international level, Moore played for the England national youth team. The team reached the UEFA Youth Tournament final in 1958,[10] The team did win the British Amateur Youth Championship that year.[10]\n\nAlongside Geoff Hurst, both played in the 1959 FA Youth Cup final team that lost to Blackburn Rovers (1\u20132 on aggregate), but both were also in the team that won the Southern Junior Floodlit Cup (1\u20130 v Chelsea) later that year.[11] Moore also played cricket for the Essex youth team alongside Hurst.[12]\n\nMalcolm Allison never played another first team game for West Ham as Moore became a regular. A composed central defender, Moore was admired for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way he read the game, marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class. Moore was sent off once over the course of his West Ham career, for a foul on Dave Wagstaffe in the final moment of a match against Manchester City in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown his whistle for the offence and for full-time. As red cards were not issued at that time, the dismissal did not become apparent until after the match.[13]\n\nIn 1960, Moore earned a call up to the England Under-23 squad. His form and impact on West Ham as a whole earned him a late call-up to the full England squad by Walter Winterbottom and The Football Association selection committee in 1962, when final preparations were being made for the summer's World Cup finals in Chile. Moore was uncapped as he flew to South America with the rest of the squad, but made his d\u00e9but on 20 May 1962 in England's final pre-tournament friendly\u00a0\u2013 a 4\u20130 win over Peru in Lima. Also d\u00e9buting that day was Tottenham Hotspur defender Maurice Norman. Both proved so impressive that they stayed in the team for the whole of England's participation in the World Cup, which ended in defeat by eventual winners Brazil in the quarter finals at Vi\u00f1a del Mar.\n\nOn 29 May 1963, 22-year-old Moore captained his country for the first time in just his 12th appearance after the retirement of Johnny Haynes and an injury to his successor, Jimmy Armfield. He was the youngest man ever to captain England at the highest level. England defeated Czechoslovakia 4\u20132 in the game and Armfield returned to the role of captain afterwards, but new coach Alf Ramsey gave Moore the job permanently during a series of summer friendlies in 1964, organised because England had failed to reach the latter stages of the European Championships.\n\n1964 turned out to be quite an eventful year for Moore. As well as gaining the England captaincy, he lifted the FA Cup as West Ham defeated Preston North End 3\u20132 in the final at Wembley, courtesy of a last-minute goal from Ronnie Boyce. On a personal level, Moore was also successfully treated for testicular cancer and was named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year.\n\nThe FA Cup success would become the first of three successful Wembley finals in as many years for Moore. In 1965, he lifted the European Cup Winners Cup after West Ham defeated 1860 Munich 2\u20130 in the final with both goals coming from Alan Sealey. By now he was the first choice captain for England with 30 caps, and around whom Ramsey was building a team to prove correct his prediction that they would win the 1966 World Cup.\n\n1966 had a mixed start for Moore. In January, he scored his first England goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Poland at Goodison Park,[14] but two months later captained West Ham to the final of the League Cup\u00a0\u2013 in its last season before its transfer to Wembley as a one-off final\u00a0\u2013 which they lost 5\u20133 on aggregate to West Bromwich Albion. For Moore, who had scored in the first leg, and his West Ham teammates Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters, considerable consolation lay ahead. Moore scored his second and ultimately final England goal in a friendly against Norway, two weeks before the World Cup would begin.\n\nOn the verge of his greatest triumph, details were released to the press in early 1966 that Moore wanted to leave West Ham. Moore had let his contract slip to termination, and only after the intervention of Sir Alf Ramsey and realisation he was technically ineligible to play, did he re-sign with West Ham to allow him to captain the England team of 1966. Ramsey had summoned West Ham manager Ron Greenwood to England's hotel and told the two of them to resolve their differences and get a contract signed up. Moore was the leader of the World Cup winning side and established himself as a world-class player and sporting icon. With all their games at Wembley, England had got through their group with little trouble, they then beat Argentina in their quarter final and a Eus\u00e9bio-led Portugal team in the semi-finals. West Germany awaited in the final.[15]\n\nAccording to Geoff Hurst's autobiography, England full back George Cohen overheard Ramsey talking to his coaching staff about the possibility of dropping Moore for the final and deploying the more battle-hardened Norman Hunter in his place. However, eventually they settled on keeping the captain in the team. Moore had not been playing badly, nor had he given the impression that he had been distracted by his contract dispute prior to the competition. The only possible explanations were that the Germans had some rather fast attacking players, which could expose Moore's own lack of pace, and that Hunter\u00a0\u2013 who was of a similar age to Moore but only had four caps\u00a0\u2013 was the club partner of Moore's co-defender with England, Jack Charlton.\n\nIn the final, England went 1\u20130 down through Helmut Haller, but Moore's awareness and quick-thinking helped England to a swift equaliser. He was fouled by Wolfgang Overath midway inside the German half and, rather than remonstrate or head back into defence, he picked himself up quickly while looking ahead and delivered an instant free kick on to Hurst's head, in a movement practised at West Ham. Hurst scored.[15]\n\nThe West Ham connection to England's biggest day became stronger when Peters scored to take England 2\u20131 up, but the Germans equalised in the final minute of normal time through Wolfgang Weber\u00a0\u2013 as Moore appealed unsuccessfully for a handball decision\u00a0\u2013 to take the match into extra time.\n\nRamsey was convinced the Germans were exhausted, and after Hurst scored a controversial and heavily debated goal, the game looked over. With seconds remaining, and England under the pressure of another German attack, the ball broke to Moore on the edge of his own penalty area. Teammates shouted at Moore to just get rid of the ball, but he calmly picked out the feet of Hurst 40\u00a0yards\u00a0(36\u00a0m) upfield, who scored to bring the score to 4\u20132.[15]\n\nOf many memorable images from that day, one is of Moore wiping his hands clean of mud and sweat on the velvet tablecloth before shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth II as she presented him with the Jules Rimet trophy (World Cup). The Guardian wrote \"Moore is the calmest person in the stadium as he leads the England players up to the Royal Box\".[15]\n\nMoore became a national icon as a consequence of England's success, with he and the other two West Ham players taking the World Cup around the grounds which West Ham visited during the following domestic season. He was awarded the coveted BBC Sports Personality of the Year title at the end of 1966, the first footballer to do so, and remaining the only one for a further 24 years.[16] He was also given an OBE in the New Year Honours List.[15]\n\nMoore's image and popularity allowed him to start a number of business ventures, including a sports shop next to West Ham's ground, Upton Park, and he also appeared with his wife Tina, along with Peters and his wife Kathy, in a television advertisement for the pub industry, urging people to \"Look in at the local\".[17]\n\nHe continued to play for West Ham and England, earning his 50th cap in a 5\u20131 win over Wales at the end of 1966 in a Home International match which also doubled up as a qualifier for the 1968 European Championships. England ultimately reached the semi-finals (the tournament was just a four-team event) where they played Yugoslavia in Florence and lost 1\u20130. England, as champions, did not have to qualify for the next World Cup, and Moore remained the first name on Ramsey's team sheet, winning his 78th cap prior to the squad's flight to South America for a short period of altitude-acclimatisation, before going on to the finals in Mexico.[15]\n\nThe year 1970 was a bittersweet, mixed and eventful one for Moore. Retained as captain for the 1970 World Cup, there was however heavy disruption to preparations when an attempt was made to implicate Moore in the theft of a bracelet from a jeweller in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, where England were involved in a warm-up game. A young assistant had claimed that Moore had removed the bracelet from the hotel shop without paying for it. While Moore had been in the shop (having entered with Bobby Charlton to look for a gift for Charlton's wife, Norma), no proof was offered to support the accusations. Moore was arrested and then released. He then travelled with the England team to play another match against Ecuador in Quito. He played, winning his 80th cap, and England were 2\u20130 victors, but when the team plane stopped back in Colombia on the return to Mexico, Moore was detained and placed under four days of house arrest. Diplomatic pressure, plus the obvious weakness of the evidence, eventually saw the case dropped entirely, and an exonerated Moore returned to Mexico to rejoin the squad and prepare for the World Cup. He received a guard of honour from his squad when he arrived at the team hotel.[15]\n\nBy common consent, Bobby Moore's greatest game was the fabled 1970 World Cup group match against Brazil in Guadalajara. To crown it all of course is \"that tackle by Moore\" celebrated in song [\"Three Lions\"] and replayed a million times since. One hundred years from now when anyone asks what made Moore special, it will be the first piece of evidence.\n\n\u2014The Times, \"Most famous tackle looked like Superman stopping a train\".[18]\n\nMoore went on to play a leading role in England's progress through their group. On 2 June he captained England to a 1\u20130 victory against Romania. In the second game against favourites Brazil, there was a defining moment for Moore when he tackled Jairzinho with such precision and cleanness that it has been described as the perfect tackle.[19] It continues to be shown on television around the world.[19][20] Brazil still won the game 1\u20130, but England progressed through the group. Moore swapped shirts with Pel\u00e9 after the game.[19] The shirt was displayed at the National Football Museum in Manchester, courtesy of the Priory Collection.[21] A 1\u20130 win over Czechoslovakia allowed England to finish second in the group and advance to the knockout stage.\n\nAt the Quarter Final stage, a rematch of the 1966 World Cup against West Germany, England took a 2\u20130 lead but lost 3\u20132 in extra time. At the end of the year, Moore was voted runner-up (behind Gerd M\u00fcller of West Germany) for the 1970 European Footballer of the Year award.[22]\n\nOn 10 August 1970, Moore received an anonymous threat to kidnap his wife and hold her to a \u00a310,000 ransom. This caused him to pull out of pre-season friendlies against Bristol City and Bournemouth. However, his services to West Ham were rewarded with a testimonial match against Celtic at the end of 1970.\n\nAlthough Moore was seen as an icon and a perfect influence on the game, he was not without his faults or controversies. On 7 January 1971, he and three West Ham teammates, Jimmy Greaves, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, were all fined by West Ham manager Greenwood after going out drinking in a nightclub until the early hours of the morning prior to an FA Cup third round tie against Blackpool. The nightclub in Blackpool was owned by Moore's friend, boxer Brian London. West Ham lost the tie 4\u20130. They were all fined a week's wages. Blackpool were the bottom of Division one at the time, and were relegated at the end of the season. Coincidentally, Moore was featured on TV as the subject on This Is Your Life the night before. Brian Glanville stated that it was not uncommon for Moore to drink heavily, but he was often seen training with West Ham the next day, working off the alcohol he had consumed the night before.[23] On 12 June 1972, he also played for the Greek side Olympiacos, as their captain, in a friendly match against the Brazilian club Corinthians.[24]\n\nMoore surpassed West Ham's appearances record in 1973 when he played for the club for the 509th time. Three days earlier, on Valentine's Day 1973, he won his 100th cap for England in a comprehensive 5\u20130 win over Scotland at Hampden Park[25] By this stage, only Peters and Alan Ball from the 1966 squad were also still involved with the England team. Later the same year, Moore was exposed defensively by Poland in a qualifier for the 1974 World Cup in Chorz\u00f3w, deflecting a free kick past goalkeeper Peter Shilton to put the home side ahead, and then losing possession to Wlodzimierz Lubanski, who scored the second.[26]\n\nMoore's form had dipped enough for Ramsey to choose not to select him for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being replaced by Norman Hunter in defence and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant he was no longer required, to which Ramsey replied: \"Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year.\" It never happened, as England could only draw 1\u20131. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorz\u00f3w, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When Kevin Hector finally did come on for Martin Chivers after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to David Miller \"you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, we need someone to go through the middle. He just nodded. We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch.\" Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken. England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager when he was sacked six months later.[27]\n\nMoore won his 108th and final cap in the next game, a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to Italy on 14 November 1973. He became England's most capped player, beating Bobby Charlton's record by two appearances, and equalled Billy Wright's record of 90 appearances as captain. Peter Shilton, David Beckham and Steven Gerrard have since overtaken the caps record, but the joint captaincy record remains.[28]\n\nHe could hardly run, couldn\u2019t turn, couldn\u2019t head a ball, and had no left foot. But he was the world\u2019s greatest defender. He had a better head on his shoulders than any of the others, and even though he was coming towards the end of his career when he joined Fulham, he was still a great player and a tremendous asset. I remember his first ever pass to me. It was very hard and to my right, so I had to turn sharply to reach it. I thought: \u2018He only passed the ball 15 yards, so why didn\u2019t he pass it to my feet?\u2019 But as I turned the player marking me was on my left side \u2013 so in fact Bobby had beaten him for me. That was the difference.\n\n\u2014 John Mitchell on his Fulham teammate Bobby Moore.[29]\n\nMoore played his last game for West Ham in an FA Cup tie against Hereford United in January 1974. He was injured in the match. On 14 March the same year, he left West Ham after more than 15 years, taking with him the club record for appearances (since overtaken by Billy Bonds) and the most international caps for an outfield player.\n\nHe joined London rivals Fulham, who were in the Second Division, for \u00a325,000. During Moore's first season there they defeated West Ham in a League Cup tie and then reached the FA Cup Final where they faced West Ham again. This time Fulham lost the game, 2\u20130, and Moore made his final appearance at Wembley as a professional player.[29]\n\nMoore played his final professional game in England for Fulham on 14 May 1977 against Blackburn Rovers. He played for two teams in the North American Soccer League\u00a0\u2013 San Antonio Thunder in 1976 (24 games, 1 goal) and Seattle Sounders in 1978 (7 games). During 1976, there was also a final appearance on the international field for Team USA in games against Italy, Brazil and an England team captained by Gerry Francis. This was the U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament, which capitalised on NASL and more importantly England and Italy both failing to qualify for the European Championships that year.\n\nIn April 1978, he signed as a professional player with Danish side Herning Fremad to promote Danish football's new transition to professional football, playing 9 games for the club before he retired.[30] In May 1978, he signed with Canadian side Edmonton Black Gold for a summer exhibition schedule, although he only joined the team six weeks later ahead of the June 23 match against Benfica.[31] After Moore's second game with Edmonton against the Seattle Sounders on June 28, he was signed by the Sounders on July 7.[32]\n\nThe following year, Moore played for Highgate-based club Cracovia for a tour of Malaysia.[33] In 1983, Moore appeared in 8 games for the now-defunct Carolina Lightnin', after injuries left the club without cover.[34]\n\nMoore retired from playing professionally in 1978, and had a short relatively unsuccessful spell in football management at Eastern AA in Hong Kong, Oxford City and Southend United.\n\nHe became manager of Southend United in 1984. In his first full season, 1984\u201385, Southend narrowly avoided having to apply for re-election to the Football League amid severe financial difficulties. However, the side was gradually rebuilt and in the 1985\u201386 season Southend started well and were in the promotion race until the new year before eventually finishing 9th. His successor, David Webb built upon those foundations to win promotion the following year. Moore agreed to serve on the board of the club and held this role until his death.[35] Moore joined London radio station Capital Gold as a football analyst and commentator in 1990.[36]\n\nHis life after football was eventful and difficult, with poor business dealings and his marriage ending. Moore's supporters said that the Football Association could have given a role to him, as the only Englishman to captain a FIFA World Cup winning team or given him an ambassadorial role.[37]\n\nMoore was fined \u00a3150 and banned from driving for 12 months for drink-driving on 12 April 1977, his 36th birthday at Stratford.[38] On 15 December 1983 he was arrested in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire and banned from driving for three years and fined \u00a3175 for drink-driving on 11 January 1984.[39]\n\nMoore's first cancer was in 1964, two years before England's first World Cup win \u2014 a diagnosis of testicular cancer, treated by orchidectomy of one; it had not spread.[40] In April 1991, Moore underwent an operation for suspected colorectal cancer. At the time it was reported as an \"emergency stomach operation\".[41]\n\nOn 14 February 1993, he announced he was suffering from colorectal cancer and liver cancer; by this time it had spread. Three days later he commentated on an England match against San Marino at Wembley, alongside his friend Jonathan Pearce. Moore attended a dinner after the match and made a presentation.[42] That was to be his final public act; seven days later on 24 February, at 6:36\u00a0am, he died at the age of 51.[41]\n\nHe was the first member of the England World Cup winning side to die, the next being Alan Ball 14 years later. Moore was outlived by the squad's trainer, Harold Shepherdson, who died in September 1995, and manager, Alf Ramsey, who died in April 1999, John Connelly in October 2012, Ron Springett in September 2015, Gerry Byrne in November 2015, Jimmy Armfield in January 2018, Ray Wilson in May 2018, Gordon Banks in February 2019, Martin Peters in December 2019, Peter Bonetti and Norman Hunter in April 2020, Jack Charlton in July 2020, Nobby Stiles in October 2020, Jimmy Greaves in September 2021, Ron Flowers in November 2021 and George Cohen in December 2022. Moore's funeral was held on 2 March 1993 at Putney Vale crematorium and his ashes kept in the plot of his father, Robert Edward (died 1978) and his mother, Doris Joyce (died 1992) at City of London Cemetery and Crematorium.\n\nThe first West Ham home game after his death was on 6 March 1993, against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Boleyn Ground was awash with floral tributes, scarves and other football memorabilia from West Ham fans and those of other clubs. Fellow 1966 World Cup winners Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters placed a floral replica of a West Ham shirt, showing Moore's number, 6, on the back, on the centre spot before the game. West Ham rested the No. 6 for the game, with the regular No. 6, Ian Bishop, wearing No. 12. The game was won by West Ham 3\u20131: Trevor Morley, Julian Dicks and Matty Holmes as to the trio, Steve Bull as to the reply.[43]\n\nHis former England teammate, Jack Charlton, on a BBC documentary of Moore's life in and outside of football,[44] said of Moore's death:\n\nWell, I only ever cried over two people, Billy Bremner and Bob... [long pause] He was a lovely man.\nOn 28 June 1993, a public service was held in Westminster Abbey, attended by all the other members of the 1966 World Cup team. He was only the second sportsman to be so honoured, the first being West Indies cricketer Sir Frank Worrell.\n\nFor many years he delighted supporters of West Ham and was a formidable opponent in the eyes of those against whom he played. But it is for his appearances for England\u00a0\u2014 ninety of them as captain\u00a0\u2014 that he will be chiefly remembered, and supremely for his captaincy of the World Cup team of 1966.[45]\nThe Bobby Moore Fund is a charity in the United Kingdom, formed in 1993 by Stephanie Moore, and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) in memory of her late husband to raise money for research into bowel cancer and also public awareness of the disease.[46][47] A campaign, Make Bobby Proud was initiated in 2013 to fundraise. As of February 2013 the Bobby Moore Fund had raised \u00a318.8m towards bowel cancer research.[48]\n\nIn 1996, comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel used the line \"But I still see that tackle by Moore\" in the lyrics to their song \"Three Lions\", which was the England team's official song at the 1996 European Championships, which was adopted by fans rather than the tournament's official song \"We're In This Together\" by Simply Red.[18] It referred to the famous incident with Jairzinho in 1970, and was re-created by Baddiel, Skinner and England left back Stuart Pearce for the video. It was written in the context of a list of great England moments of the past as proof that England could win a tournament again.[18]\n\nMoore was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player. The same year he was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons.[49] In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA's Jubilee, he was selected as the Golden Player of England by The Football Association as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years.[50]\n\nOn 28 April 2003, Prince Andrew as president of The Football Association unveiled the World Cup Sculpture (also called The Champions) in a prominent place near the Boleyn Ground, at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street. It depicts Moore holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft, on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters. The one and a half-size bronze was sculpted by Philip Jackson after a famous photograph taken just after the 1966 final at the old Wembley. The south bank at West Ham's ground up until 2016, the Boleyn Ground in Upton Park, was named the Bobby Moore Stand shortly after Moore's death. When West Ham moved to the London Stadium in 2016, a stand at the north end of the stadium was redesignated as the Bobby Moore Stand, and was officially opened as such before a pre-season friendly match against Italian side Juventus. The Moore family was represented at the official opening ceremony by Moore's grandson, Frederick Moore-Hobbis.\n\nOn Friday 11 May 2007, a statue of Bobby Moore was unveiled by Sir Bobby Charlton outside the entrance of the newly reconstructed Wembley Stadium as the \"finishing touch\" to the project, with the stadium officially opening on Saturday 19 May with the staging of the 2007 FA Cup Final. The twice life-size bronze statue, also sculpted by Jackson, depicts Moore looking down Wembley Way.[51][52][53]\n\nIn August 2008 West Ham United officially retired the number 6 shirt as a mark of respect, 15 years after his death.[6]\nOn 26 July 2016, Moore became the first footballer to be honoured with an English Heritage Blue Plaque outside his home. The plaque was unveiled on a brick wall at Moore's childhood home in Waverley Gardens, Barking in a ceremony attended by his daughter, Roberta.[54]\nIn April 2017 airline Norwegian announced Moore's image would appear on the tail fin one of their Boeing 737-800 aircraft.[55] Moore is one of the company's six \"British tail fin heroes\", joining Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, children's author Roald Dahl, pioneering pilot Amy Johnson, novelist Jane Austen and aviation entrepreneur Freddie Laker.[56][57][58] In 2018, Moore was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in EA Sports' FIFA video game FIFA 19.[59]\n\nThe Bobby Moore Academy primary and secondary schools are located in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Newham near to the London Stadium and were founded in 2017.[60] The Academy has access to facilities at the Park in addition to links to West Ham United, and will have 1,500 student places at full capacity.[60]\n\nWest Ham United\n\nEastern AA\n\nEngland\n\nMoore appeared in the 1981 film Escape to Victory, as Terry Brady, and in cameo roles, as himself, in several episodes of Till Death Do Us Part, including one of its spin-off films The Alf Garnett Saga.\n\nTina and Bobby, a television drama series about Tina and Bobby Moore's relationship, was broadcast on ITV in January 2017, and repeated in August 2020 and June 2021. The part of Bobby Moore is played by Lorne MacFadyen.[80]\n\nMoore met his first wife, Tina, in 1957. They married on 30 June 1962.[81] They lived in a house in Chigwell, Essex, that they called \"Morlands\".[82] They had a daughter, Roberta, and a son, Dean.\n\nThey separated in 1984,[83] and divorced in 1986.[84] A relationship developed with Stephanie Parlane (eight years his junior)\u2014they married on 4 December 1991 but Moore died on 24 February 1993, 14+1\u20442 months later.[85]\n\nHis son, Dean, died, aged 43, in his flat on 28 July 2011, attributed to a medical condition and natural causes.[86]\n\nMoore publicly supported Margaret Thatcher at the 1979 general election.[87]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Moore"}, {"id": 56, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/69/1366943/original/kevin-keegan-photo-u3?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Kevin Keegan", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/kevin-keegan/1366943", "desc": "Joseph Kevin Keegan, OBE (born 14 February 1951) is an English former football player and manager.

A forward, he played for several professional clubs from 1968 to 1984. Having begun his career at Scunthorpe United, he moved to Liverpool in 1971 and then to Hamburger SV in 1977, enjoying great success at both clubs. During this period, he was a regular member of the England national team. He was twice the winner of the Ballon d'Or. After leaving Hamburg in 1980, he played for Southampton and Newcastle United. Keegan returned to football in 1992 as manager at Newcastle. He later managed Fulham and Manchester City. At all three clubs, the team won promotion as champions in his first full season there. He managed England from 1999 to 2000.\n\nKeegan began his playing career at Scunthorpe in 1968, before Bill Shankly signed him for Liverpool where he won three First Division titles, the UEFA Cup twice, the FA Cup and, in his final season, the European Cup. Keegan gained his first England cap in 1972. He moved to Hamburg in the summer of 1977 and was named European Footballer of the Year in 1978 and 1979. Hamburg won the Bundesliga title in 1978\u201379 and reached the 1980 European Cup Final. Keegan moved to Southampton for two seasons at the club before a transfer to Newcastle United who were then in the Second Division in 1982. He helped Newcastle to promotion in his second season, and retired from playing in 1984, having been capped 63\u00a0times for England, scoring 21\u00a0goals.\n\nKeegan moved into management at Newcastle in 1992, the team winning promotion as First Division champions. Newcastle finished second in the Premier League in 1995\u201396, after leading for most of the season. After managing Fulham for two seasons, he took charge of the England team in February 1999, but resigned in October 2000 following a 1\u20130 loss against Germany in qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In 2001, he became manager of Manchester City for four years until he resigned in 2005. Keegan had been out of football for almost three years when he returned to Newcastle United for a second spell as manager in January 2008, but this lasted only eight months, as he resigned on 4 September 2008 following speculation about a dispute with the club's directors.[3]\n\nKeegan's paternal ancestors arrived in Newcastle from Ireland.[4] In 1909, his grandfather Frank, an inspector, heroically saved lives in the West Stanley Pit disaster.[5] His father Joe and uncle Frank were Newcastle United fans,[6] describing their favourite players as Hughie Gallacher and Jackie Milburn.[7]  His father moved to Armthorpe in Doncaster to work in a colliery,[8] where he married Doris[9] and they had three children: Mary, who was two years Keegan's senior,[10] Kevin, and Michael.[11] His father never saw Keegan play for Newcastle.[12]\n\nKeegan was born at his aunt Nellie's house in Elm Place in Armthorpe.[13] His aunt's house was chosen as she had electricity that made it safer for childbirth.[13] Keegan attended St. Peter's High School[1] in nearby Cantley.\n\nKeegan was given his first football by his uncle Frank[14] and his first pair of football boots by his father after he had a win on the horses.[15] They were a second-hand pair of Winit boots bought from the former Doncaster Rovers centre forward, Ray Harrison's sports shop.[15] Keegan played football at Hyde Park using his baby brother Michael's pushchair as a goal post.[16] As a boy he supported Doncaster Rovers.[17] His favourite player was Alick Jeffrey,[17] a player, once described by Matt Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy as the English Pel\u00e9,[17] and once described by Jackie Milburn as \"the best young player he had ever seen\".[17] As a schoolboy, Keegan had a trial for Coventry City, under manager Jimmy Hill. Despite being one of two players kept on for an extra six-week period, the club did not offer Keegan a contract, though they did offer apprenticeship terms to the right-back Brian Joy who also went on to have a 15-year career in football.[18] Keegan also had a trial with Doncaster Rovers, arranged by his father, but when Keegan arrived, he found out he had been given the wrong information and the trial was earlier in the day and at a different place.[19]\n\nKeegan participated in various sports, such as cross country running, rugby, football, and even captaining his school's cricket team.[20] He also boxed at his local club, run by the former British Heavyweight champion Bruce Woodcock.[21] At age 15, Keegan, with two friends, completed a 50-mile run from Nottingham to Doncaster. Afterwards he claimed he would never hit a psychological brick wall again with regards to running. In his autobiography, Keegan claimed this run prepared him physically and psychologically for any running he had to do in any future pre-season training or football matches.[22] Keegan left school with O Levels in History and Art.[23]\n\nAt the age of 15 Keegan started work at Pegler Brass Works as an office clerk; though he has stated that he was more of a tea boy and messenger than an office clerk.[24] Whilst working at Pegler, Keegan continued playing Saturday afternoon football for his local youth club, Enfield House, and playing Sunday morning football for the Lonsdale Hotel.[25] It was during this time that a colleague, named Harry Holland, invited him to play for the Peglers Works reserves on a Saturday morning.[26] His chance at professional football came when he was playing Sunday morning league football for the Lonsdale Hotel in a match against Woodfield Social in 1966. Keegan was marked by a player in his mid 30s, called Bob Nellis. After playing against Keegan, Nellis became impressed by the ability of Keegan and offered him a trial at Fourth Division side Scunthorpe United \u2013 one of just two professional sides in the division. This trial would lead to the Scunthorpe manager Ron Ashman giving Keegan his first contract in professional football.[27][2][28]\n\nScunthorpe United could not afford a set of football nets and trained on a rugby pitch at Quibell Park.[29] They also, risking injury, had five-a-side training sessions on the Old Showground concrete car park.[30] Still though, at Scunthorpe Keegan would take his training very seriously. Twice a week, after training, Keegan would train with a teammate named Derek Hemstead and they would train by doing weighted farmers walks up and down the cantilever stand at the Old Showground.[31] A trait Keegan had was his running ability. In running drills at Scunthorpe Keegan liked trying to finish first and Keegan was told by Jack Brownsword that one thing he has going for him is that he is a one hundred percenter and he should never lose that.[32] Though this will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior pros such as Liverpool's Tommy Smith[33] and Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.[34]\n\nScunthorpe, a club with little money, did not have a full-time driver to drive them to away games and Keegan, with other the other younger players, such as Nigel Jackson, would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games.[35] Young Keegan, fellow driver Nigel Jackson and fellow young professionals Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson, once borrowed coach Jack Brownsword's stop watch and had timed rallies around the Old Showground with the club's vintage tractor.[36] On Keegan's turn the tractor crashed and the tractor's axle went through the engine.[36] The crash was very expensive to fix and the five were given a rollicking by manager Ron Ashman.[36] This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United.[36] Keegan made his debut against Peterborough United at the age of 17, making 29 league starts in his first season.[37] He became a regular in the first team by the 1969\u201370 season, playing all 46 league games for the club.[38] This season saw the team reach the fifth-round of the FA Cup, beating Football League First Division side Sheffield Wednesday along the way. Keegan then missed only one game in his last season.[38] Earning a pittance, meant Keegan each summer had to find summer jobs; and each summer he would do jobs such as plate-laying at the Appleby Frodingham Steelworks.[39]\n\n Keegan played regularly in a creative right midfield role for the Scunthorpe United first team despite his age \u2013 he scored 18 goals in 124 games for the club. After his first season he started attracting interest from higher division clubs. In one rare television interview of Keegan at Scunthorpe in 1969\u201370, Keegan tried to play down the interest, stating: \"I'm getting first-team football here. Should think if I went First Division, I'd struggle a bit.\"[40] Not long after this interview, Keegan, noting other players had moved on to a higher level, began to feel impatient about moving on and Keegan even considered packing the game in and getting a full-time job if he did not get a move to a higher level.[41] Higher division clubs such as Preston, Birmingham City, Notts County, Millwall and Arsenal all showed interest but nothing came of it.[42]\n\nIn 1971, he attracted the attention of Liverpool's head scout Geoff Twentyman,[43][44] whose opinion was held in high regard by manager Bill Shankly. After Twentyman's recommendation, Liverpool made an offer for Keegan and this offer was accepted by Scunthorpe United. After Scunthorpe had agreed to the fee Keegan was driven the four hours to Bill Shankly's office by manager Ron Ashman who was determined to get a cash influx for Scunthorpe United.[45] Prior to the journey Keegan's father prompted Keegan to not sell himself cheap.[46] Keegan then haggled a contract worth \u00a350 a week from Shankly, after Shankly had originally offered him \u00a345.[45] Ashman, sensing a cash windfall may fall through, was at one stage aghast at Keegan's negotiation game.[45] On the drive back to Scunthorpe Ashman was critical of Keegan's bluff that he was almost earning \u00a345 a week at a fourth division football club.[45]\n\nAfter the negotiation Keegan was transferred to Liverpool for \u00a333,000[47] in 1971, at the age of 20.[28][48]\n\nLiverpool bought Keegan as a midfielder, but Shankly soon decided to move Keegan upfront alongside John Toshack. In a reserve match against Tranmere Rovers Keegan, playing right midfield, and after playing a game with an attacking philosophy he was strongly warned by Ronnie Moran that he was \"playing too free and easy,\" and \"nearly playing up front.\"[49] At one stage Keegan took Moran's criticism on board, took the criticism as a slight, and for a period perceived that Moran strongly had it in for him.[50] As a result of young Keegan's lack of positional discipline, Keegan was then tested upfront in a preseason reserve match against Southport.[51] Keegan scored both goals in a 2\u20131 victory.[51] This match was watched by Shankly.[51] Liverpool then tried Keegan in attack at Melwood in a game between the first team and the reserves.[52] Keegan played for the first team and scored 4 in a 7\u20130 victory.[53] His attacking play and ability prompted manager Bill Shankly to stop playing Keegan at right midfield and instead Shankly decided Keegan would be more effective upfront.[54] After his first preseason at Liverpool Keegan was immediately deployed as the new strike partner for Toshack.[55]\n\nThough Keegan did like Toshack as a teammate, Keegan never socialised with him off the pitch and Keegan maintained it was almost spooky how much they instantaneously could read each other's little and large game.[56] In his career Keegan explained that the only player who reached that level of footballing understanding with him was England international Trevor Brooking.[56]\n\nOn 14 August 1971, Keegan made his Liverpool debut against Nottingham Forest at Anfield, scoring after 12 minutes.[57] Keegan made his England debut at under-23 level later in 1971. His full debut came in a World Cup qualifier against Wales at Ninian Park. Keegan's first goal for his country also came in a game against Wales in Cardiff. This time it was a British Home Championship match that England won 2\u20130 on 11 May 1974, his third full cap.[58] Shankly had told Keegan he would play for England 18 month before it happened.[59]\n\nEarly on at Liverpool, Keegan stopped acknowledging his first name Joseph on his autograph and just signed it Kevin Keegan, instead of the JK Keegan that he scribbled at Scunthorpe.[60]\n\nIn 1972\u201373, Keegan won his first major honours. Don Revie's Leeds United visited Anfield on Easter Monday for a showdown involving two of the three League challengers. The game turned on a few minutes either side of half time. First Leeds' Peter Lorimer missed an open goal. Two minutes after the break Peter Cormack took his chance to put Liverpool ahead. Keegan added a late second to seal the win. With Arsenal dropping a point at Southampton, Liverpool duly closed out the title with a final game 0\u20130 draw against Leicester City. This was their first major trophy since 1966.[61]\n\nLiverpool also won the UEFA Cup. The 1973 UEFA Cup Final first leg at Anfield was abandoned due to a downpour after 27 minutes and rescheduled to be played again the next day. The 27 minutes that had been played had given Liverpool manager Bill Shankly an insight into Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's defensive vulnerability in the air. To exploit this he brought tall forward Toshack into the starting team demoting the smaller Brian Hall, who appeared only as a late substitute.[62] Keegan scored two goals set up by Toshack headers in a 3\u20130 win. Liverpool lost 2\u20130 away to win 3\u20132 on aggregate.[63]\n\nThe following season, Keegan was again a frequent scorer but Liverpool lost the League title to a Leeds United team that went unbeaten for a then-record 29 games at the start of the season. Liverpool, however, progressed to the FA Cup final. Their campaign in the competition had started with a tie against the club which had rejected Keegan, Doncaster Rovers, and it was Keegan who scored both Liverpool goals in a 2\u20132 draw. Liverpool won the replay and Keegan scored twice more on the way to Wembley Stadium, including a lob-volley over the head of England colleague Peter Shilton in the semi-final against Leicester City at Villa Park.\n\nIn the 1974 final, Liverpool played Newcastle United. Keegan explained that Shankly's motivation was made easy after the pre-game talking by Supermac (Malcolm Macdonald) and to a lesser extent John Tudor.[64] Tudor and Keegan's friend, Macdonald, gave interviews confidently proclaiming they had more ability whilst also being critical of older Liverpool pros such as Tommy Smith.[64] Keegan also believed Shankly may have got into the heads of the Newcastle players when on the night before the game Shankly and Joe Harvey were being interviewed and Shankly was heard on the microphone, but off-camera, stating, \"Joe looks a bag of nerves...\"[64] Keegan explained, knowing Shankly it would not surprise him if this was not an accident and Shankly knew what he was doing and that this statement was meant to neutralise any of Newcastle's confidence and that this did indeed rub off into the heads of some of the Newcastle players who became anxious.[64] In the final, Keegan scored two as Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3\u20130.[65] It was the first brace in an FA Cup final since Mike Trebilcock scored twice for Everton in 1966. The game against Newcastle was Keegan's first FA Cup Final.[64] To Keegan, with the 100,000 inside the ground, the non-stop chanting of both sets of fans, and then the millions watching on TV, this game was as close to a non drug-induced psychedelic experience as he could ever get.[64] He noted how after this final Shankly, he and the other Liverpool players were sympathetic to the devastated Newcastle players and tried to not rub it in with their victory.[64]\n\nKeegan's next visit to Wembley was three months later in the Charity Shield game, the traditional curtain-raiser to a new season, between the League champions and the FA Cup winners. Leeds had decided to niggle at Liverpool, and in particular Keegan, in the match. In one instance Johnny Giles punched the unsuspecting Keegan and was reprieved after Keegan asked the referee to be lenient.[66] Giles, after escaping a red card, then later lunged two-footed at Keegan.[66] Upon Keegan's outraged reaction Billy Bremner challenged Keegan.[66] Keegan then exploded and punched Bremner.[66] Bremner punched back.[66] They were sent off, the first time anyone had been sent off in a Charity Shield match.[66] Both players removed their shirts in protest, with Keegan visibly shaken by the decision. Inside the Liverpool dressing room, Bremner approached Keegan to apologise and was met by the fury of Keegan's father who had come down to check on his son.[66] They both received lengthy bans.[66] The fight was shown that night on BBC television and both were fined \u00a3500, with Keegan being suspended for three games and Bremner eight.[28]  Despite this, Keegan, Bremner and Giles remained good friends outside of football.[66]\n\nThe next year saw Keegan scoring goals and representing his club and country, but 1974\u201375 was a trophyless season for Liverpool and England failed to qualify for the European Championships. There were numerous honours for Keegan over the next two years, however, as Liverpool again won the League championship and UEFA Cup in 1975\u201376. Keegan scored in both legs of the UEFA Cup final against FC Bruges, having only scored once previously during Liverpool's run in the competition.[28]\n\nIn 1976\u201377, Keegan helped Liverpool get close to an unprecedented \"treble\" of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup, although midway through the season he announced his intention to leave in the summer to play abroad. Nevertheless, Keegan was irrepressible as Liverpool clinched the title and reached the finals of both Cup competitions. Keegan's last appearance in a Liverpool shirt on home soil saw Liverpool lose the FA Cup final to bitter rivals Manchester United, ending the possibility of the treble.[28] The European Cup final in Rome against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach was four days later. Keegan did not score, but he did make a late run which led to a foul inside the penalty area by Berti Vogts. This led to a penalty which was successfully converted by Phil Neal, sealing a 3\u20131 win. In this season, on 4 December 1976, Keegan's father, who had been suffering from cancer, died at the age of 71.[11]\n\nAfter 323 appearances and exactly 100 goals, Keegan left Liverpool. He had been made offers from clubs across Europe, and chose to join Hamburger SV in the West German Bundesliga for \u00a3500,000. Liverpool replaced him with Kenny Dalglish.[28] Of his time in Liverpool, Keegan later said, \"The only thing I fear is missing an open goal in front of the Kop. I would die if that were to happen. When they start singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' my eyes start to water. There have been times when I've actually been crying while I've been playing.\"[67]\n\nKeegan's transfer to Hamburg was agreed between the FA Cup final and the European Cup final of 1977, although Keegan had negotiated a maximum transfer fee the season before.[68] With the British record transfer record set by Keegan at \u00a3500,000,[69] and Keegan almost doubling the German transfer record,[70] Keegan arrived in Germany, joining a club that had not finished higher than sixth in two decades.[71] Keegan told ITV that his annual salary the last season he played for Liverpool was \u00a322,000 whereas at Hamburg it was \u00a3122,000. [72]\n\nFollowing his move to Hamburg, Keegan became an early trendsetter with his new haircut, the perm. On first sight, his wife thought it was hilarious and his agent jokingly tried to disown him in public.[73] Soon though, players such as Bryan Robson, Charlie George, Phil Neal, Terry McDermott also had 1980s perms.[73] Later, when Keegan was at Newcastle United as a manager, he and Terry McDermott would joke about the perm on a national kit supplier advert.[74] Keegan, who was Hamburg's best-paid player and had been intensely billed as the superstar signing from England who would transform an average German team by the club's business manager Dr Peter Krohn,[75] was not immediately accepted by his new teammates.[76] Keegan perceived things that highlighted he was not immediately accepted. In training he would not receive the ball after he made a run.[77]\n\nRules also stated that no club was allowed more than two foreign players, and unknowingly to Keegan he had also upset some of his new teammates as his move had indirectly moved out the three times European Cup winner Horst Blankenburg.[78] Blankenburg was a very popular member of the squad.[78] There was also a belief and a resentment amongst the players that the previous coach, who the players liked and did not think needed replacing, was replaced by Krohn, to accommodate Keegan.[79] It was not until Keegan had moved out of temporary accommodation and moved to a bungalow in the little village of Itzstedt that Keegan began to feel he could make inroads and make a go of football and life in Germany.[80]\n\nIn one early interview Keegan mentioned how he was settling in. He explained how he missed British cereals that he could not find in the supermarkets in Germany. The Hamburg fans then flooded him with parcels of his favourite cereal with lists of the suppliers.[81] There were language difficulties early on. In one instance in the summer, Keegan went into a hardware shop intending to buy a fuse and he eventually left the shop after buying Christmas lights.[82]\n\nHe scored in pre-season friendlies against Barcelona and former club Liverpool, but the club suffered defeat in the European Super Cup against the Merseysiders. Keegan's time in Hamburg got off to a bad start. Keegan's first league match was against Duisburg and Hamburg lost 5\u20132. Rudi Gutendorf, the manager some believe was appointed for Keegan, would last until October.[83]\n\nIn the winter break of his first season, and being isolated by the clique in the dressing room, frustrated Keegan was sent off in a friendly against lower league club VfB L\u00fcbeck.[84][85] A player in the match decided to target Keegan. After the third time being smashed, Keegan walked to the goading L\u00fcbeck player and punched him.[85] Keegan who knew he was going to be sent off, walked off the pitch prior to any decision by the referee.[85] Keegan maintains this was the lowest ebb of his time in Germany and following this moment Keegan then decided to master the German language and be in a position to fully integrate in order to be in a strong position to ask the players why they were not passing to him, and to show the players in the training ground caf\u00e9, he too loved the club.[85]\n\nKeegan was suspended for 8 weeks and in those 8 weeks Keegan and the squad made efforts to integrate.[86] Keegan knew the dressing room was turning, when he was getting invited to the squad nights out, when one player told him he could get cheap meat for his dogs and when the full back Peter Hidien even got a perm.[86] An unhappy first few months at the club gave way to a more successful season. Although the club finished tenth in the league in 1977\u201378, Keegan's 12 goals helped him pick up a personal honour, the France Football European Footballer of the Year award for 1978.[84][87]\n\nHamburg appointed Branko Zebec, a Yugoslav, as a new coach.[88] Zebec was a man who was known to work players to the max.[88] Zebec's squad did a lot of running and Keegan claimed he had never been worked as hard in his life.[89] The 1978\u201379 season saw a vast improvement on the club's 1978 finish. With new manager Branko Zebec imposing a tough training regime, and Keegan's increasing grasp of the German language, coupled with the newly imposed discipline meant that Hamburg finished as league champions for the first time in nineteen years.[84] The club's success also translated into individual recognition for Keegan, who picked up the European Footballer of the Year award for a second consecutive year at the club.[87] The European Footballer of the Year award had been running since 1956 and by 1979 only Keegan, Alfredo di Stefano, Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff had won the award two or more times.[90] By 2017 Keegan was amongst ten players who had won the award two or more times since 1956.[91] After the 1978\u201379 season, Juventus, Real Madrid and the Washington Diplomats tried to sign Keegan offering good terms, but Keegan decided to see out his contract at Hamburg and to try and win the European Cup.[92] In 1979 Keegan was given the nickname Mighty Mouse from the Hamburg fans.[93] This nickname came from a popular cartoon superhero from the 1970s and 1980s.[93]\n\nAfter training Keegan would be exhausted, and only have enough energy to sleep. In February in the 1979\u201380 season, Keegan announced he was leaving after his contract was up. One of the reasons for leaving was Zebec's training regime. Keegan had a lot of respect for Zebec,[94] though Keegan also reasoned that Zebec's extreme fitness regime philosophy was flawed for the modern-day footballer.[95] Keegan even told Zebec that his training regime would burn himself out as a footballer and that he believed he would be finished from playing by 30 if he continued.[95] Zebec, in turn responded to Keegan's critique and explained to Keegan it was the same for all the players.[95] Keegan then implied to Zebec that players have different roles and not all players run the same distances on match days; he pointed out to Zebec that because of his role and his effort, on match days not many players in the squad ran as much as himself.[95] At Hamburg Keegan even doodled with a pen and paper what he thought of the training regime.[94] Keegan, as the metaphorical prisoner, drew a cartoon picture of Zebec in sunglasses, with he and his teammates doing press-ups, and then scribed Roman numerals conveying Keegan was counting down to his freedom. These drawings were left in his training ground locker. The drawings and Keegan's personal locker are now held in the Hamburg museum under the title 'HSV Legenden'[94]\n\nHamburg's European campaign of 1979\u201380 saw Keegan score two goals to help Hamburg past Dinamo Tbilisi, Soviet champions who had beaten Liverpool to reach the latter stages. On the run Hamburg beat, Dinamo Tbilisi, Valur, Hajduk Split and Real Madrid.[96] In the first leg against Real Madrid they were comfortably beaten 2-0 and most football pundits then predicted Hamburg were probably out.[96] Hamburg then upset the apple-cart by winning the return leg 5\u20131.[96] Keegan regarded this as one of the most outstanding team performances he had the fortune to be a part of.[96] In the final they played Nottingham Forest. Forest played with 11 men behind the ball, and won the game 1\u20130 with a goal from John Robertson.[96] This cup final defeat was coupled domestically with being beaten to the Bundesliga title by Bayern Munich. Having negotiated a maximum transfer fee of \u00a3500,000 in his contract the year before and agreeing to a move in February, Keegan left Hamburg for Southampton in the summer of 1980.[97]\n\nOn 11 February 1980, Lawrie McMenemy called a press conference at the Potters Heron hotel, Ampfield to announce that the European Footballer of the Year would be joining Southampton in the forthcoming summer.[98] The news caused surprise throughout the world of football and around the city of Southampton, as Southampton were a relatively small club.[98] The club were beginning to become established in the top division, but this signing showed how persuasive their manager could be, especially when Keegan captained England in the 1980 European Championships in Italy.\n\nKeegan had a clause inserted into his contract when he joined Hamburg in 1977, giving Liverpool the option to buy him back.[99] Liverpool, however, opted not to exercise this clause when he returned to England three years later. As late as November 2011, Keegan has stated, \"I was with Lawrie [McMenemy] at a charity event the other day, and he said he phoned up Peter Robinson because he wanted me, but Liverpool had a clause. Peter said, 'No, we won't be signing him, definitely, we don't need him.'\" It was, therefore, Southampton boss Lawrie McMenemy who snapped him up for \u00a3420,000, and Keegan made his Southampton debut at Lansdowne Road in a pre-season friendly against Shamrock Rovers on 23 July 1980.\n\nKeegan's two seasons at The Dell saw him as part of a flamboyant team also containing Alan Ball, Phil Boyer, Mick Channon and Charlie George.[100] In 1980\u201381 Saints scored 76 goals, finishing in sixth place, then their highest league finish.[101]\n\nIn the following season, Keegan was able to produce some of his best form and at the beginning of April 1982 Southampton sat at the top of the First Division table,[101] but a run of only three wins from the end of February meant a seventh-place finish,[102] 21 points off 1st place.[101] Despite this, Keegan was voted the PFA Player of the Year and awarded the OBE for services to Association Football. Keegan had scored 26 of the team's 72 goals and was voted the club's Player of the Year.[103] This second season was the most prolific of his career and he, in total scored 30 goals and he won the golden boot.[103]\n\nKeegan had fallen out with McMenemy over the manager's failure to strengthen Southampton's defence (which conceded 67 goals in 1981\u201382) while the team was at the top of the table.[104] There were also rumours that McMenemy had charged the whole team of cheating after a 3\u20130 defeat by Aston Villa in April 1982 to which Keegan took great exception.[105] Although Keegan joined Saints' next pre\u2013season tour, he had already decided to move. In 2019 Lawrie McMenemy explained that prior to the start of the 1982\u201383 season, Keegan believed that Southampton did not match his footballing ambitions and therefore Keegan had made up his mind and demanded to leave, and there was nothing the club could do about it.[106] A few days before the start of the 1982\u201383 season he signed for Newcastle United[106] for a fee of \u00a3100,000.\n\nKeegan joined Newcastle United and spent two seasons there, during which time he was extremely popular with the supporters. Keegan's first press conference, to announce his signing, was held in the Gosforth Park Hotel.[107] Upon signing the twice European footballer of the year in the second division, a local newspaper's main headline was simply, 'Here he is!'[108]\n\nKeegan always felt at one stage in his career he would play for Newcastle United.[109] As a child Keegan's father would tell him football stories about Milburn and Gallagher. Keegan explained his father would have loved Keegan playing football in black and white stripes,[110] and to Keegan playing for Newcastle felt like coming home.[110] There was euphoria in Newcastle at the signing of Keegan and Keegan felt he was there to help the fans to start believing in themselves.[111] Keegan had never experienced that kind of deification before.[111] Keegan explained, no one could have made him more welcome.[112] People had warned Keegan that whatever he was thinking his welcome would like, it would not be enough...[113] To Keegan, who had played in a European Cup final, Wembley and Hamburg, the atmosphere on his debut was unique, explaining that the noise on his debut come from all sides of the ground like a surround-sound system.[113] He made his debut and scored his first goal against QPR. After scoring, Keegan did something he had never done before, Keegan instinctively, and famously, threw himself into the crowd to 'show the fans he was one of them,'[111] and explained to the press afterwards that 'I just wanted to stay there for ever...'[114] Keegan had a fear of letting the fans down, constantly telling himself 'You can't let them down.'[115]\n\nKeegan at Newcastle was the senior pro. Keegan, along with Terry McDermott, Jeff Clark and David McCreery, now had a senior status.[116] As a senior pro, his manager, Arthur Cox, who would later join many of Keegan's coaching teams when Keegan would later become a manager, had a different relationship to Keegan than with other players.[116] Cox would ask Keegan his opinion on players.[116]\n\nTo Keegan, Cox was a task master,[117] with a good sense of humour.[117] Cox would condition the players like commandos by having Keegan and his teammates running up and down the hills in Gateshead.[118]\n\nIn his first season Newcastle finished fifth.[119] and Keegan maintained that after a faltering season, this position was a flattering league position.[119] Keegan, finished this season with 21 goals in 37 appearances and won North East Player of the Year.[120]\n\nIn September 1983, Keegan answered a phone call at 1:00 am from Arthur Cox.[121] In the phone call Cox explained to Keegan, sharply, he had signed a player called Peter Beardsley from Vancouver Whitecaps and explained to Keegan that he'd like him; after giving Keegan the message, Cox immediately put the phone down...[121] A few days later Keegan met Beardsley at Benwell.[121] Keegan and his teammates, at first sight, thought Beardsley was just a lad who had won the competition to train with the first team.[121] It was only when they saw him in action that they knew he had something about him. At Beardsley's first training session Keegan could not believe his eyes at what a talent he was witnessing.[121] Keegan once stated about Beardsley, \"At Scunthorpe I always thought Terry Heath had the wow factor, because of his skill on the ball, and when I moved to Liverpool I had never seen anyone with Peter Thompson's ability. By the time I started playing for Newcastle, however, I had played against Cruyff, Maradona and Pel\u00e9, and yet I have never had my mind blown as I did on the first day I saw Peter Beardsley.\"[121]\n\nKeegan announced his retirement prior to the end of the 1983\u201384 season, on 14 February 1984 - his 33rd birthday.[122] Keegan felt his career was finished after a cup game, a month prior, away at Liverpool.[123] In this match Keegan was put through on goal from a through ball. This through ball had caught all the defenders flat-footed, left the defenders out of the equation, and left Keegan one on one with the keeper Bruce Grobbelaar.[123] Keegan thought this was his moment to put Newcastle 1-0 up in front of the thousands of Newcastle fans behind the goal.[123] Keegan who had been in a one on one with the goal keeper many times in training, and in football matches, felt, with his pace, with his experience in this position, it was second nature to finish the move.[123] Keegan though was intercepted by the recovering Mark Lawrenson. As Keegan was moving towards goal with his pace, Lawrenson caught up to Keegan and stole the ball off him from the side. At this precise moment, it occurred to Keegan he had now lost his yard of pace.[123] At the end of the game a frustrated Keegan, whilst clapping off the fans, had decided this would be his last season as a footballer.[123]\n\nKeegan felt if he had have extended his career at Newcastle in the first division he would have had to adjust his game and move from the attacking role he had built his footballing identity on over the last 15 years of his career.[124] Keegan did not want to extend his career by moving back into midfield in the first division with Newcastle. He wanted to retire on a high at Newcastle United.[124]\n\n'I was the mongrel who made it to Crufts, and that was fine by me...'\n\n\u2014 Two times European Footballer of the Year, Kevin Keegan, on his football career.[125]\n\nKeegan's last league game was against Brighton & Hove Albion, scoring in a 3\u20131 victory. He played 78 times, he was prolific and he scored 48 goals and helped them to promotion from the Second Division in 1984, within a team which also contained Peter Beardsley, Chris Waddle and Terry McDermott. His final appearance for Newcastle came in a friendly against Liverpool some days later, leaving the pitch in a helicopter while still dressed in his kit.[126][127] Famously, a then unknown 13-year-old Alan Shearer, who Keegan would later break the world transfer record for, whilst manager of Newcastle, was a ball boy in Keegan's testimonial.[127] Keegan would also famously rule out football management.[127]\n\nKeegan moved with his family to Spain. Keegan, who had stated that he would never enter football management, did carry out occasional work as a football pundit for British television.\n\nIn April 1985, Keegan briefly came out of retirement to play a two-game stint as a guest player for Blacktown City in Australia's National Soccer League. He scored in the first fixture in a 3\u20132 loss to Canberra City.[128]\n\nKeegan made his England debut on 15 November 1972 in a 1\u20130 World Cup qualifying win over Wales. Keegan appeared in only the two matches against Wales during this campaign as England failed to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup.[129]\n\nHe scored his first international goal in his third appearance, also against Wales, on 11 May 1974. He was given the captaincy by manager Don Revie in 1976 after Gerry Francis fell victim to a long-term injury. He went on to captain England 31 times, retaining the captain's armband until his international retirement after the 1982 World Cup.\n\nKeegan captained England at Euro 1980. England failed to progress from the group stage after finishing third in their group behind Italy and Belgium.\n\nHe managed only one World Cup appearance though, after England failed to qualify for both the 1974 and 1978 tournaments. He finally reached a World Cup in 1982 when England got to the finals in Spain. He was named in the squad for the tournament, but was suffering from a chronic back injury and was unfit to play in all of England's group games. In a last, desperate effort to play in a World Cup (he knew that he would not be around for the 1986 competition) he secretly hired a car and drove from Spain to a specialist he knew in Germany for intensive treatment. He recovered sufficiently to appear as a substitute for the last 26 minutes of England's final second-round game against hosts Spain. During this time he missed a point-blank header which would have broken the deadlock, in a game England needed to win by a better scoreline than 2\u20131 to progress to the semi-finals (a 2\u20131 victory would have left them tied with West Germany). England drew the game 0\u20130 and were eliminated from the competition.\n\nFollowing the successful start to the 1982\u201383 season with Newcastle United, there was much controversy when newly appointed England manager Bobby Robson did not select Keegan for his first squad,[130] a decision Keegan learned of from the media rather than Robson himself. Keegan publicly expressed his displeasure at not being given the courtesy of a phone call from Robson, and never played for his country again. He had won a total of 63 caps and scored 21 goals.\n\nOn 5 February 1992, almost eight years after his final game as a player, Keegan returned to football as manager of Newcastle United. They had been relegated from the top flight in 1989 and narrowly missed out on promotion in 1990 after losing in the playoffs to arch-rivals Sunderland, but in 1991 they had failed to make the playoffs and at several stages in 1991\u201392, they had temporarily occupied bottom place in the Second Division. Following the dismissal of previous manager Ossie Ardiles, Keegan was appointed to prevent Newcastle from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time. Keegan joined a club that still had participants from the old board room battles that had been going on at the club for decades.[131] It has been argued the internal struggles from the former regime had held the club back.[131] After three or more years trying, John Hall had recently won the board room from the old regime.[131] Though John Hall was not yet confirmed as the chairman he had accrued enough power to make the key decisions.[131] The board members belonging to the former regime were only told by John Hall, one hour before Keegan's first press conference that Kevin Keegan would be the manager.[131] Keegan had only watched two live matches in seven years. One was the European Cup final in 1991 and the other being a Newcastle United 0\u20130 draw against Blackburn; as such, calls were made that suggested Keegan was unprepared and inexperienced.[132]\n\nWhen Keegan turned up to Benwell for his first training session as manager, he noted the training ground was in a mess. Keegan was surprised at the timely neglect of the training ground facilities.[133] The training ground was in the process of being sold, despite this, Keegan paid for the clean up of the training ground with his own money,[133] with the cleaning work being done in one weekend.[133] Keegan felt this clean up work was an important move and an indirect statement to the players that conveyed to the players that their professionalism, from now on, had to be high.[133] Assessing the squad, Keegan opined that the squad was not good enough to reach the level he and McDermott once played at.[134] In five-a-sides he and Terry McDermott, both in their 40s, with their lack of conditioning, believed they were two of the stand out players.[134] Keegan noted the club had an impressive crop of youth players. This crop included: Lee Clark, Steve Watson, Steve Howey, Alan Thompson and Robbie Elliott.[134] These young players would form a core of players involved in Keegan's Newcastle squads from 1992 to 1997.[134] Keegan noted Steve Watson would take throw-ins via a somersault throw and this amused and shocked Keegan.[135] Keegan regarded it as a gimmick and he could not believe the fans would take joy in it.[135] The throw-in, to Keegan, was a sign of how far Newcastle had fallen.[135] Keegan wanted the club to be known for scoring goals and thrilling football.[135] Prior to his first game, Keegan made his first tough call with his squad of players when he dropped the midfielder Lee Clark.[136] Though he liked Clark's spirit, Keegan believed he was at risk of being sent off.[136] Prior to the game Keegan arranged a training match for the reserves and included himself to make up the numbers.[137] In the training match a frustrated Clark went through the back of Keegan in a knee high tackle, following a hospital pass, in a similar way that Romeo Benetti went into the back of Keegan in an England versus Italy match.[137] The melee resulted in Pavel Srnicek swinging a roundhouse kick at Lee Clark's head.[137] Keegan was not upset and he did not punish either player.[137] To Keegan, Srnicek and Clark's response showed they cared about their football.[137] Keegan's first game, against Bristol City, ended in 3\u20130 victory in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nOn 14 March 1992, following a 3\u20131 win over Swindon Town, Keegan had become frustrated with Chairman John Hall.[138] Keegan perceived he had not given the transfer funds he had been promised.[138] As a result of this frustration, Keegan briefly walked out of the Newcastle job.[138] This resulted in a phone call between Keegan and Hall, where they settled their differences and where Hall guaranteed Keegan millions of pounds to spend on new players.[138][139]\nFurther assessing his squad, Keegan noted some players could not handle the pressure and would sneak in by a turnstile rather than meet and greet the big crowds at the front entrance prior to games.[140] Keegan decided to move these players on.[140] With the club's transfer funds Keegan decided he needed a leader in the team, someone with a wild look about him, a look that meant business.[141] Keegan signed the experienced Brian Kilcline.[141] Keegan stated about Kilcline, \"Even on his bad days his head never dropped, he was tough as teak, absolutely fearless\" and \"He was a ready-made captain - one of my more important signings as Newcastle's manager.\"[141] Keegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the 1992\u201393 season.\n\nPrior to the 1992\u201393 season, Keegan strengthened the defence with the acquisition of Barry Venison from Liverpool and John Beresford from Portsmouth, while striker David Kelly had arrived on Tyneside a few months before Keegan was appointed. Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of Bristol City striker Andy Cole in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of Charlton Athletic's Rob Lee bolstered the midfield in the autumn.\n\nNewcastle were promoted to the Premier League as Division One champions.\n\nTop scorer David Kelly and influential midfielder Gavin Peacock were both sold during the close season, and Keegan brought striker Peter Beardsley back to Newcastle from Everton, six years after he had been sold by Newcastle to Liverpool.\n\n1993\u201394 was an enormous success for Newcastle as they finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup, bringing European football to the club for the first time since the 1970s. Andy Cole was the Premier League's top scorer with 34 goals from 40 games, and managed a club record total of 41 goals in all competitions.\n\nKeegan then strengthened his side by signing Swiss World Cup defender Marc Hottiger and Belgium's defensive midfielder Philippe Albert, while Norwich City's quick winger Ruel Fox had arrived on transfer deadline day in March 1994.\n\nNewcastle won their first six games of the 1994\u201395 season to top the league and they appeared capable of winning their first league title since 1927. But the shock departure of Andy Cole to Manchester United in January weakened their attack, and finished the season sixth place in the final table; not enough for even another UEFA Cup campaign. In the meantime, autumn signing Paul Kitson partnered Beardsley in attack.\n\nKeegan made several important additions to the Newcastle side in the summer of 1995: Reading goalkeeper Shaka Hislop, Paris Saint-Germain's French winger David Ginola, Queens Park Rangers striker Les Ferdinand and Wimbledon defender Warren Barton. Ferdinand was Newcastle's biggest signing at \u00a36 million, while the \u00a34 million paid for Barton was the highest fee paid for a defender in English football at the time.\n\nNewcastle excelled in the first half of the 1995\u201396 season, going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at West Ham United on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's 4\u20133 defeat to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against Tottenham Hotspur on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by Manchester United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at Middlesbrough would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as Les Ferdinand, Darren Peacock, David Ginola, Peter Beardsley, Faustino Asprilla and Rob Lee would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies.[142]\n\nDuring the race for the 1995\u201396 title, Keegan directed remarks at the Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, during a post-match interview live on Sky Sports. His outburst \u2013 \"I would love it if we beat them! Love it!\" \u2013 is frequently referred to when describing the relationship between the pair.[143] In April 2003, it was named as Quote of the Decade in the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards and Most Memorable Quote in the 20 Seasons Awards in May 2012. It also appeared in Channel 4's 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[144]\n\nKeegan then broke the world transfer fee record by signing Blackburn Rovers and England striker Alan Shearer in July 1996. Shearer, who had been the Premier League's top scorer in the last two seasons, was born in Newcastle and had grown up as a fan of the club.[145] Shearer made an instant impact on his native Tyneside, despite being on the losing side on his debut, a 4\u20130 FA Charity Shield defeat at the hands of Manchester United, and scored two months later in a 5\u20130 victory against United in the Premier League. Newcastle briefly topped the league at several stages in the first half of the season and Shearer led the league scoring 25 goals.[146]\n\nOn 8 January 1997, Keegan announced his resignation as manager. A club statement following his resignation read:\n\nNewcastle United Football Club today announce the resignation of manager Kevin Keegan. Kevin informed the board of his wish to resign at the end of the season, having decided he no longer wishes to continue in football management at this stage in his life. Following lengthy discussions of which the board attempted to persuade Kevin to change his mind, both parties eventually agreed that the best route forward was for the club to, reluctantly, accept his resignation with immediate effect.\n\nKeegan left the club with a short statement reading:\nIt was my decision and my decision alone to resign. I feel I have taken the club as far as I can, and that it would be in the best interests of all concerned if I resigned now. I wish the club and everyone concerned with it all the best for the future.\nOn the Newcastle United DVD Magpie Magic, it is said that Chairman John Hall asked for a long-term commitment as manager from him which he was unwilling to give, while it also states that many still rumour that the pressure and criticism of selling Andy Cole and the failed title challenge in 1995\u201396 took its toll on him.[147]\n\nHe was succeeded by Kenny Dalglish, the same man who had replaced him as a player at Liverpool 20 years earlier, but Newcastle were unable to win the title and finished second place in the same season, and in the following season finished outside the top ten in the Premier League, although they were FA Cup runners-up. They did not return to the top five of the Premier League until the 2001\u201302 season, when they finished fourth under Sir Bobby Robson.\n\nIt was during this period that Keegan gained the nickname \"King Kev\" from Newcastle fans.\n\nKeegan returned to football on 25 September 1997 as \"chief operating officer\" (a similar role to a director of football) at Division Two club Fulham, with Ray Wilkins as head coach. Fulham finished sixth in the final table, but Wilkins was sacked just before the first leg of the playoff semi-final and Keegan took over as manager.\n\nHis appointment came a few months after the takeover of the club by Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, who gave Keegan \u00a310 million to spend on players that season as the first part of a \u00a340 million attempt to deliver Premier League football to the Craven Cottage club, who had been outside the top flight since 1968 and had not even played in the league's second tier since 1986.[148]\n\nKeegan was unable to inspire Fulham to overcome Grimsby Town in the playoffs, but good form in 1998\u201399 \u2013 helped by the acquisition of more players who would normally have been signed by Premier League or Division one clubs \u2013 clinched them the Division Two title and promotion to Division One, but Keegan left at the end of the season to concentrate on his duties as England manager, having succeeded Glenn Hoddle in February 1999.[149]\n\nFulham replaced Keegan with Paul Bracewell and reached the Premier League two years later under Bracewell's successor Jean Tigana, with a squad still featuring many of the players bought by Keegan or Wilkins.[150]\n\nAfter weeks of speculation,[151] Keegan was named as the new England manager on 18 February 1999, succeeding Glenn Hoddle, who had been sacked two weeks earlier following a newspaper interview in which he suggested that disabled people were being punished for their sins in a previous life.[152][153] He led the team to a winning start with 3\u20131 victory over Poland to reignite England's campaign to qualify for Euro 2000 in Group 5.[154]  However, points dropped in draws against Sweden, Bulgaria and in the return fixture against Poland left England facing elimination as they sat out the last round of matches.  Fortunately however for England and Keegan, Poland lost their last match in Sweden in Group 5, and England instead entered the qualification playoff with Scotland. Two goals from Paul Scholes gave them a 2\u20130 win in the first leg,[155] and despite a 1\u20130 defeat in the second leg,[156] they qualified for the championships for the fourth tournament in succession (though on the third occasion, they had qualified automatically as hosts).\n\nAfter goodwill following this success, Keegan however began to come under fire for his perceived tactical naivety. This came to a head during the unsuccessful Euro 2000 campaign, which began with a 3\u20132 defeat against Portugal, despite England having taken a 2\u20130 lead after 17 minutes.[157] A 1\u20130 win in the next game over Germany, the first English victory over Germany in a competitive match since 1966, helped to eliminate their opposition (the defending champions),[158] but in the final group game against Romania, England once again lost 3\u20132, this time after taking a 2\u20131 lead, and their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals were over.[159]\n\nKeegan resigned as England manager on 7 October 2000,[160][161] after England lost to a Dietmar Hamann goal for Germany in their first 2002 World Cup qualifier, in the last game to be played at Wembley Stadium,[162] before the old stadium was rebuilt. Keegan won only 38.9% of his games in charge, the lowest such percentage of any permanent England manager \u2013 although unlike Don Revie (1974\u20131977) or Steve McClaren (2006\u20132007), Keegan achieved qualification to a major tournament for England.\n\nWhen Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson became England manager, Eriksson appointed the 64-year-old Tord Grip as his assistant. This caused Keegan to complain that when he was England manager, the FA had told him that he could not have Arthur Cox as his assistant because at 60, Cox was too old. Keegan went on, \"I wasn't allowed to bring in the people I wanted and that was wrong. Mr Eriksson was and I'm delighted for him because that's the way it should be.\"[163]\n\nOn 24 May 2001, Keegan returned to football as successor to Joe Royle at Manchester City, who had just been relegated from the Premier League. Keegan signed experienced international players such as Stuart Pearce, Eyal Berkovic and Ali Benarbia. That season, City were promoted as Division One champions after scoring 108 league goals. Keegan was the first manager in the Premier League era to win the Division One title with two clubs.[164]\n\nIn preparation for his second season as manager (2002\u201303), he signed Nicolas Anelka, Peter Schmeichel and Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9. That season saw Manchester City win against Liverpool at Anfield and take four points from Manchester United (their previous win in the Manchester derby being in September 1989), but concede five goals away to Chelsea and at home to Arsenal, securing their Premier League status comfortably by finishing ninth. Keegan also guided City into the UEFA Cup, qualifying via the UEFA Fair Play ranking.[164]\n\nFor 2003\u201304, the club's first season at the new City of Manchester Stadium, Keegan added Steve McManaman, Paul Bosvelt, David Seaman and Michael Tarnat to City's squad.[165] City started well and were fifth in the league on 5 November. However, a draw at home to Polish minnows Groclin led to their second-round elimination from the UEFA Cup, and was followed by a slump in form. City did not win again in the league until 21 February, and finished 16th in the league, although at Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup on 4 February 2004, despite going in at half time 3\u20130 behind and with ten men after Joey Barton was sent off; Keegan's team came back to win 4\u20133.[164]\n\n2004\u201305 brought better form for Manchester City, but Keegan agreed to leave as manager on 10 March 2005 after telling the chairman his desire to retire from football at the end of the season.[164] The club went on to finish eighth under his successor Stuart Pearce, and only missed out on a UEFA Cup place when Robbie Fowler missed a penalty in stoppage time of a 1\u20131 draw with Middlesbrough on the last day of the season, with the last European place going to their opponents instead. Earlier that season, while still under Keegan's management, City beat Chelsea 1\u20130 which turned out to be the only defeat in the league that season for Chelsea, who ended up as Premier League champions.[166]\n\nAfter declaring his retirement from football in 2005, Keegan remained out of the media spotlight, working at the Soccer Circus football school in Glasgow.[167] In October 2007, he indicated he was unlikely to manage again.[168]\n\nFollowing the dismissal of manager Sam Allardyce,[169] Keegan made a sensational, unexpected return to Newcastle United on 16 January 2008. Thousands of Newcastle United fans attended St James' Park to welcome the manager back to the club as he arrived to see the FA Cup third-round replay against Stoke City alongside owner Mike Ashley and chairman Chris Mort.[170] He managed his first game at the club since 1997 against Bolton Wanderers on 19 January 2008.[171] He awarded the club captaincy to Michael Owen, stating, \"He's not scared to give his opinion when he's right, and he's not scared to say what he feels. He's a tremendous professional, and he trains properly every day.\"[172] Keegan announced on 22 January that he and Alan Shearer held talks about the two linking up with Shearer as his assistant, but decided against the idea, leaving the door open for him to take other roles he was interested in.[173]\n\nKeegan's first eight games back at Newcastle passed without a win. On 22 March 2008, however, Keegan achieved the first victory of his second managerial spell, a 2\u20130 win against his former club Fulham.[174] This was his first win as Newcastle manager since beating Leeds United on 1 January 1997, and he followed it up with wins over Tottenham and Sunderland, maintaining his perfect record over the club's local rivals in the Tyne-Wear derby and also putting Newcastle on top of the league's form chart.[175][176] This run of good form was hugely thanks to a new 4\u20133\u20133 formation which was spearheaded by the productive strike trio of Obafemi Martins, Michael Owen and Mark Viduka. The trio scored 11 of the club's 14 goals in this run, which safely secured the club from a relegation battle. Newcastle's seven-game unbeaten run came to an end in a home defeat to Chelsea, and they finished the season in 12th place.[177]\n\nHaving signed Argentine international winger Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez,[178] as well as Guti\u00e9rrez's Argentina teammate and defender Fabricio Coloccini from Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, amongst others,[179][180] Newcastle began the 2008\u201309 season with a 1\u20131 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford, having lost the previous season's fixtures 6\u20130 and 5\u20131,[181] as well as beating Bolton 1\u20130 the following week[182] and Coventry City 3\u20132 in the second round of the League Cup on 26 August.[183]\n\nAs the 2007\u201308 season drew to a close, rumours of tensions between the club's directors and Keegan began to surface, as he publicly criticised the board, claiming they were not providing him the financial support necessary to break into the top four of the Premier League standings.[184] His accusations caused bad press for owner Mike Ashley, who was already battling reports that he had lost hundreds of millions of pounds in a disastrous stock market venture.[185]\n\nFollowing the closure of the transfer window at midnight on 1 September 2008, early on in the morning the following day, various media sources reported that Keegan had either resigned from the club or had been sacked,[186] leading to fan protests around St James' Park.[187] The club released statements denying that he had left the club, but stated that talks were ongoing between Keegan and members of the board.[188][189] On 4 September 2008, Keegan issued a statement confirming that he had resigned the same day, stating that, \"... a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want.\"[3] Late on Friday 12 September 2008, it was reported Keegan met owner Mike Ashley in London in an attempt to resolve their differences, but the meeting ended without a satisfactory conclusion for either party.[190]\n\nRichard Bevan, chief executive of the League Managers Association (LMA), stated the following month that Keegan would consider a return to the club but only if those who hold the ownership are willing to develop a structure which he is happy with.[191] The club was also warned by the LMA on 5 September 2008 to develop a structure which would satisfy the next manager to replace Keegan to avoid a similar situation repeating itself and damaging the club's image.[192] Following Dennis Wise's resignation as director of football at Newcastle in April 2009, many fans directed the blame of Keegan's exit at both owner Mike Ashley and Dennis Wise as a result of such a role being established and poorly used.[193]\n\nIn December 2008, it was reported that following Ashley's decision to withdraw the sale of Newcastle United, a legal dispute in regards to Keegan's departure of the club was in place between himself and Ashley,[194] with Keegan claiming unfair dismissal and Ashley claiming damage to his public image. In September 2009, it was reported that Keegan had met with Ashley and the Newcastle board \u2013 including former members \u2013 in a Premier League arbitration hearing for a claim of \u00a310 million in compensation for his shock resignation.[195] All sides agreed to the arbitration being held publicly.[196]\n\nKeegan's dispute with the club was resolved in October 2009. The tribunal ruled in favour of Keegan, agreeing that Newcastle had constructively dismissed him by insisting on the signing of midfielder Nacho Gonz\u00e1lez on loan (which was against his wishes) to replace James Milner following his move to Aston Villa and a bid for Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger being rejected.[197] Although Wise's signing of Spanish striker Xisco was not mentioned in the hearing, Keegan stated that this had also been a central factor in his departure.[198]\n\nThe ruling[199] was based around seven issues. The panel declared that Keegan had been misled to believe he had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth that he did not or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect that this was not a factor. The club's signing of Gonz\u00e1lez meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While Gonz\u00e1lez was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club until 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded \u00a32\u00a0million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the standard contract severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, but he stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.[200]\n\nIn pursuit of winning the tribunal, the club admitted to misleading the media and their fans. Several key senior staff, including Dennis Wise and Derek Llambias, had publicly claimed that Keegan had \"the final word\"; they claimed to the tribunal that this was not in fact the case and that their claims were just \"PR\". It was then revealed that Director of Football Dennis Wise asked Keegan to sign Gonz\u00e1lez after watching him \"on YouTube\". On 21 October, a subsequent meeting of the same panel found that the club should pay all legal and associated costs incurred by Keegan as a result of the tribunal. They reached this conclusion based on their view that the club's \"defence on the primary liability issue was, in our view, wholly without merit\".[201]\n\nKeegan stated after the hearing he still wants to manage in the top flight of football, and would consider returning to his position at the club, but feels the fans may be exhausted from his last tenure and would prefer him not to.[202] In June 2013, Keegan stated he would only consider a return should owner Mike Ashley leave the club.[203] Keegan has continued to criticise Ashley, accusing him of a lack of respect for the fans.[204]\n\nFollowing the sale of Newcastle United to the Public Investment Fund, Keegan spoke publicly at a talk-in event in Cramlington, stating his delight at Ashley's departure and excitement at the new ownership's ability to compete financially with the wealthiest football clubs in the world.[205]\n\nIn September 1970 Keegan met his future wife, Jean Woodhouse, on the Waltzers at Doncaster fair.[206] They married on 23 September 1974 and have two daughters.[207]\n\nKeegan became renowned for his \"poodle perm\" hair in the 1970s, and has regularly appeared at the top of \"worst hairstyles\" surveys.[208][209]\n\nIn early July 2008, Flybe International announced the naming of one of their new Bombardier Q400 aircraft in honour of Keegan's service to Newcastle United, both as a player and as manager. The plane was used on the regular service from Newcastle International Airport to London's Gatwick Airport.[210]\n\nHe is known for aiding charities, including appearances at cricket matches for Lord's Taverners and Sussex Cricket Club.[211][212]\n\nIn 1976, Keegan competed in the BBC's television programme Superstars. Despite suffering severe cuts after crashing his bicycle, he insisted on re-racing and secured second place in the event, before going on to win that edition of the programme.[213] He also advertised Brut aftershave alongside boxer Henry Cooper.\n\nIn 1979 Keegan and his wife, participated with ITV's \"Brian Moore meets Kevin Keegan,\" documentary filmed over the season at the family's Hamburg home and during his personal business appearances, including in France, as an insight and rare glimpse into the life of a modern millionaire footballer, away from the pitch.[214]\n\nThe same year, during his daughter's christening reception at a London hotel, Eamonn Andrews the presenter of This Is Your Life, appeared from within a giant cake, to surprise Keegan and his guests with his famous big red book.[citation needed] The TV show was broadcast on Keegan's 28th birthday, ten days later. Keegan quipped, \"I'm so glad that I wore brown trousers\".\n\nHe narrated the 90-minute documentary Keegan on Keegan, released via Castle Vision on VHS cassette in 1992.\n\nIn August 2009, nearly a year after his departure from Newcastle, Keegan resurfaced after being confirmed as the lead pundit on ESPN.[215] During the course of the 2010 World Cup, Keegan featured as a pundit for ITV broadcasts. He was part of ESPN's live coverage of the 2011, 2012 and 2013 FA Cup finals with pitch-side build-up and post-match commentary.\n\nKeegan released a single in 1972 titled \"It Ain't Easy\". In 1979, his song \"Head Over Heels in Love\", written by Chris Norman and Pete Spencer, was released on 9 June, and peaked at number 31 in the UK charts, but climbed to number 10 in Germany where Keegan was based at the time, and where Norman's band Smokie was popular.[216] He released another single, \"England\", on his return to England from Germany, but it failed to chart.\n\nIn April 1991, he was attacked while sleeping in his Range Rover by the M25 at Reigate Hill in Surrey. His assailants later said in court that they needed money for a drugs debt and had no idea they were attacking Keegan.[217]\n\nIn February 2009, Keegan had three points added to his driving licence after being caught doing 36\u00a0mph in a 30\u00a0mph zone on the A69 road in August 2008. This brought his total to 12 points and he consequently received a six-month driving ban.[218]\n\nLiverpool\n\nHamburg\n\nIndividual\n\nNewcastle United\n\nFulham\n\nManchester City\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Keegan"}, {"id": 57, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/98/1944882/original/roy-keane-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Roy Keane", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/roy-keane/1944882", "desc": "Roy Maurice Keane (born 10 August 1971) is an Irish football manager and former professional player.

He is the joint most successful Irish footballer of all time, having won 19 major trophies in his club career, 17 of which came during his time at English club Manchester United.[4] Regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players in 2004.[5] Noted for his hardened and brash demeanour, he was ranked at No. 11 on The Times' list of the 50 \"hardest\" footballers in history in 2007. Keane was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021.[6][7]\n\nIn his 18-year playing career, Keane played for Cobh Ramblers, Nottingham Forest, and Manchester United before ending his career at Celtic. He was a dominating box-to-box midfielder noted for his aggressive and highly competitive style of play, an attitude that helped him excel as captain of Manchester United from 1997 until his departure in 2005. Keane helped United achieve sustained success during his 12 years at the club. He then signed for Celtic, where he won a domestic double before he retired as a player in 2006.\n\nKeane played at the international level for the Republic of Ireland over 14 years, most of which he spent as captain. At the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he played in every Republic of Ireland game. He was sent home from the 2002 FIFA World Cup after a dispute with national coach Mick McCarthy over the team's training facilities.\n\nKeane began his management career at Sunderland shortly after his retirement as a player and took the club from 23rd position in the Football League Championship, in late August, to win the division title and gain promotion to the Premier League.[8] He resigned in December 2008,[9] and from April 2009 to January 2011, he was manager of Championship club Ipswich Town.[10] In November 2013, he was appointed assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team by manager Martin O'Neill, a role he held until 2018.[11] He would also have short assistant manager spells at Aston Villa in 2014 and Nottingham Forest in 2019. Keane has also worked as a studio analyst for British channels ITV's and Sky Sports football coverage.\n\nRoy Maurice Keane[1] was born into a working class family in the Ballinderry Park area of Cork's Mayfield suburb on 10 August 1971.[1] His father Maurice took work wherever he could find; this included jobs at a local knitwear company and at Murphy's Irish Stout brewery, among others. His family was keen on sport, especially football, and many of his relatives had played for junior Cork clubs such as Rockmount. Keane took up boxing at age nine and trained for several years, winning all of his four bouts in the novice league. During this period, he was developing as a much more promising footballer at Rockmount, and his potential was highlighted when he was voted \"Player of the Year\" in his first season. Many of his teammates were offered trials abroad with English football teams, but Keane was not. He supported Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur as a child, citing Liam Brady and Glenn Hoddle as his favourite players, but Manchester United player Bryan Robson later became the footballer he most admired.[12]\n\nInitially, Keane was turned down from the Ireland schoolboys squad after a trial in Dublin; one explanation from former Ireland coach and scout Ronan Scally was that the 14-year-old Keane was \"just too small\" to make it at the required level.[12] Undeterred, he began applying for trials with English clubs, but he was turned down by each one. As his childhood years passed, he took up temporary jobs involving manual work while waiting for a breakthrough in his football prospects. In 1989, he eventually signed for the semi-professional Irish club Cobh Ramblers after persuasion from Ramblers' youth team manager Eddie O'Rourke. Keane was one of two Ramblers representatives in the inaugural FAI/FAS scheme in Dublin, and it was through this initiative that he got his first taste of full-time training. His rapid progression into a promising footballer was reflected by the fact that he would regularly turn out for Ramblers' youth side as well as the actual first team, often playing twice in the same weekend as a result.\n\nIn an FAI Youth Cup match against Belvedere, Keane's performance attracted the attention of watching Nottingham Forest scout Noel McCabe, who asked him to travel over to England for a trial. Keane impressed Forest manager Brian Clough, and eventually, a deal for Keane worth \u00a347,000 was struck with Cobh Ramblers in the summer of 1990.[13]\n\nBrian Clough's advice to me before most games were: 'You get it, you pass it to another player in a red shirt.' That's really all I've tried to do at Forest and United \u2014 pass and move \u2014 and I've made a career out of it.\n\nRoy Keane[14]\n\nKeane initially found life in Nottingham difficult due to the long periods away from his family, and he would often ask the club for a few days' home leave to return to Cork. Keane expressed his gratitude at Clough's generosity when considering his requests, as it helped him get through his early days at the club.[12] Keane's first games at Forest came in the Under-21s team during a pre-season tournament in the Netherlands. In the final against Haarlem, he scored the winning penalty in a shootout to decide the competition, and he was soon playing regularly for the reserve team. His professional league debut came against Liverpool at the start of the 1990\u201391 season, and the resulting performance encouraged Clough to use him more and more as the season progressed.\n\nKeane eventually scored his first professional goal against Sheffield United, and by 1991 he was a regular starter in the side, displacing the England international Steve Hodge. Keane scored three goals during a run to the 1991 FA Cup Final, which Forest ultimately lost to Tottenham Hotspur. In the third round, however, he made a costly error against Crystal Palace, gifting a goal to the opposition and allowing them to draw the game. On returning to the dressing room after the game, Clough punched Keane in the chest in anger, knocking him to the floor.[15] Despite this incident, Keane bore no hard feelings against his manager, later claiming that he sympathized with Clough due to the pressures of management[16] and that he was too grateful to him for giving him his chance in English football. A year later, Keane returned to Wembley with Forest for the Football League Cup final but again finished on the losing side as Manchester United secured a 1\u20130 win.\n\nKeane was beginning to attract attention from the top clubs in the Premier League, and in 1992, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish spoke to Keane about the possibility of a move to the Lancashire club at the end of the season. With Forest struggling in the league and looking increasingly likely to be relegated, Keane negotiated a new contract with a relegation escape clause. The lengthy negotiations had been much talked about in public, not least by Brian Clough, who described Keane as a \"greedy child\"[12] due to the high wages demanded by the Irishman. \"Keane is the hottest prospect in football right now, but he is not going to bankrupt this club\", Clough stated. Despite the extended contract negotiations, Forest fans voted him the club's Player of the Season.[17] Despite his best efforts, Keane could not save Forest from relegation, and the clause in his contract became activated. Blackburn agreed a \u00a34\u00a0million fee for Keane, who soon after agreed to a contract with the club.\n\nA mistake, however, prevented the move to the club: when the contract had been agreed upon, Dalglish realized they did not have the correct paperwork needed to complete the transfer. This was on a Friday afternoon, and the office had been locked up for the weekend. With a verbal agreement in place, they agreed to meet on Monday morning to complete the transfer officially. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, hearing about the move, phoned Keane and asked whether he would like to join them instead of Blackburn. Ferguson ensured they had the paperwork ready and met up with Keane on Saturday and signed him for Manchester United for \u00a33.75\u00a0million, a British transfer record at the time.[18]\n\nDespite the then-record transfer fee, there was no guarantee that Keane would go straight into the first team. Paul Ince and Bryan Robson had established a formidable partnership in the center of midfield, having just inspired Manchester United to their first league title since 1967. Robson, however, was 36 years old and in the final stages of his playing career, and a series of injuries kept him out of action for most of the 1992\u201393 season and into the 1993\u201394 season. As a result Keane had an extended run in the team, scoring twice on his home debut in a 3\u20130 win against Sheffield United,[19] and grabbing the winner in the Manchester derby three months later when United overturned a 2\u20130 deficit at Maine Road to beat Manchester City 3\u20132.[20]\n\nKeane had soon established himself as a first-choice selection, and by the end of the season, he had won his first trophy as a professional as United retained their Premier League title. Two weeks later, Keane broke his Wembley losing streak by helping United to a 4\u20130 victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup Final, sealing the club's first-ever \"double\".[21]\n\nThe following season was less successful, as United were beaten to the league title by Blackburn Rovers and beaten 1\u20130 in the FA Cup final by Everton.[22][23] Keane received his first red card as a Manchester United player in a 2\u20130 FA Cup semi-final replay win against Crystal Palace, after stamping on Gareth Southgate,[24] and was suspended for three matches and fined \u00a35,000.[25][26] This incident was the first of 11 red cards Keane would accumulate in his United career, and one of the first signs of his indiscipline on the field.\n\nThe summer of 1995 saw a period of change at United, with Ince leaving for Internazionale,[27] Mark Hughes moving to Chelsea[28] and Andrei Kanchelskis being sold to Everton.[29] Younger players such as David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes were brought into the team, which left Keane as the most experienced player in midfield. Despite a slow start to the 1995\u201396 campaign, United pegged back title challengers Newcastle United, who had built a commanding 12-point championship lead by Christmas, to secure another Premier League title. Keane's second double in three years was confirmed with a 1\u20130 win over Liverpool to win the FA Cup for a record ninth time.[30]\n\nThe next season saw Keane in and out of the side due to a series of knee injuries and frequent suspensions. He picked up a costly yellow card in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Borussia Dortmund,[31] which ruled him out of the return leg at Old Trafford.[31] United lost both legs 1\u20130,[32] but this was compensated for by winning another league title a few days later.[33]\n\nAfter Eric Cantona's unexpected retirement, Keane took over as club captain, although he missed most of the 1997\u201398 season because of a cruciate ligament injury caused by an attempt to tackle Leeds United player Alfie Haaland in the ninth Premier League game of the season. As Keane lay prone on the ground, Haaland stood over Keane, accusing the injured United captain of having tried to hurt him and of feigning injury to escape punishment, an allegation which would lead to an infamous incident between the two players four years later.\n\nKeane did not return to competitive football that campaign, and could only watch from the sidelines as United squandered an 11-point lead over Arsenal to miss out on the Premier League title. Many pundits cited Keane's absence as a crucial factor in the team's surrender of the league trophy.[34]\n\n\"It was the most emphatic display of selflessness I have seen on a football field. Pounding over every blade of grass, competing as if he would rather die of exhaustion than lose, he inspired all around him. I felt it was an honor to be associated with such a player.\"\n\nSir Alex Ferguson on Keane's performance against Juventus in 1999[35]\n\nKeane returned to captain the side the following season, and guided them to a treble of the FA Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League. In an inspirational display against Juventus in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final, he helped haul his team back from two goals down to win 3\u20132, scoring the first United goal. His performance in this game has been described as his finest hour as a footballer.[36][37] Keane, however, received a yellow card after a trip on Zinedine Zidane that ruled him out of the final. United defeated Bayern Munich 2\u20131 in the final, but Keane had mixed emotions about the victory due to his suspension. Recalling his thoughts before the game, Keane said, \"Although I was putting a brave face on it, this was just about the worst experience I'd had in football.\" Keane sustained an ankle injury during the 1999 FA Cup Final, four days before the Champions League Final, which ruled him out until the following season.[38] Later that year, Keane scored the only goal in the final of the Intercontinental Cup, as United defeated Palmeiras in Tokyo.\n\nThe following season saw prolonged contract negotiations between Keane and Manchester United, with Keane turning down an initial \u00a32\u00a0million-a-year offer amid rumors of a move to Italy.[39] His higher demands were eventually met midway through the 1999\u20132000 season, committing him to United until 2004. Keane was angered when club officials explained an increase in season ticket prices was a result of his improved contract and asked for an apology from the club.[40] Days after the contract was signed, Keane celebrated by scoring the winning goal against Valencia in the Champions League, although United's defence of the Champions League was ended by Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, partly due to an unfortunate Keane own goal in the second leg. He was voted PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year at the end of the season after leading United to their sixth Premier League title in eight years.\n\nKeane caused controversy in November 2000, when he criticised sections of United supporters after the Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv at Old Trafford. He complained about the lack of vocal support given by some fans when Dynamo was dominating the game, stating, \"Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home, they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't think some of the people who come to Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it.\"[40] Keane's comments started a debate in England about the changing atmosphere in football grounds,[41] and the term \"prawn sandwich brigade\" is now part of the English football vocabulary, referring to people who attend football games or claim to be fans of football because it is fashionable rather than due to any genuine interest in the game.\n\nKeane made headlines again in the 2001 Manchester derby, when five minutes from the final whistle, he was sent off for a knee-high foul on Alfie Haaland in what was seen by many as an act of revenge.[42] He initially received a three-match suspension and a \u00a35,000 fine from The Football Association (FA), but further punishment was to follow after the release of Keane's autobiography in August 2002, in which he stated that he intended \"to hurt\" Haaland. Keane's account of the incident was as follows:\n\nI'd waited long enough. I fucking hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you cunt. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.[43]\n\nHis admission that the tackle was a premeditated assault led the FA to charge him with bringing the game into disrepute.[44] He was banned for a further five matches and fined \u00a3150,000 in the ensuing investigation. Despite widespread condemnation,[45] he later maintained in an interview that he had no regrets about the incident: \"My attitude was, fuck him. What goes around comes around. He got his just rewards. He fucked me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye\", and said he would probably do the same thing again.[46]\n\nHaaland never played a full game afterwards. However, Haaland did complete the match and played 68 minutes of the following game.[47] He also played a friendly for Norway in between both matches.[48] It was, in fact, a long-standing injury to his left knee  rather than his right, that ended his career.[49]\n\nUnited finished the 2001\u201302 season trophyless for the first time in four years. Domestically, they were eliminated from the FA Cup by Middlesbrough in the fourth round and finished third in the Premier League, their lowest final position in the league since 1991. Progress was made in Europe, however, as United reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, their furthest advance since their successful campaign of 1999. They were eventually knocked out on away goals after a 3\u20133 aggregate draw with Bayer Leverkusen, despite Keane putting United 3\u20132 up.\n\nAfter the defeat, Keane blamed United's loss of form on some of his teammates' fixation with wealth, claiming that they had \"forgot about the game, lost the hunger that got you the Rolex, the cars, the mansion\".[12] Earlier in the season, Keane had publicly advocated the breakup of the treble-winning team[50] as he believed the team-mates who had played in United's victorious 1999 Champions League final no longer had the motivation to work as hard.[51]\n\nIn August 2002, Keane was fined \u00a3150,000 by Sir Alex Ferguson and suspended for three matches for elbowing Sunderland's Jason McAteer, and this was compounded by an added five-match suspension for the controversial comments about Haaland. Keane used the break to undergo an operation on his hip, which had caused him to take painkillers for a year beforehand. Despite early fears that the injury was career-threatening,[52] and suggestions of a future hip-replacement from his surgeon,[53] he was back in the United team by December.\n\nI'd come to one firm conclusion, which was to stay on the pitch for ninety minutes in every game. In other words, to curb the reckless, intemperate streak in my nature that led to sendings-off and injuries.\n\nKeane on his 'new' style of play[12]\n\nDuring his period of rest after the operation, Keane reflected on the cause of his frequent injuries and suspensions. He decided that the cause of these problems was his reckless challenges and angry outbursts which had increasingly blighted his career.[12] As a result, he became more restrained on the field and tended to avoid the disputes and confrontations with other players. Some observers felt that the \"new\" Keane had become less influential in midfield as a consequence of the change in his style of play, possibly brought about by decreased mobility after his hip operation. After his return, however, Keane displayed the tenacity of old,[52] leading the team to another league title in May 2003.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Keane maintained a fierce rivalry with Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira. The most notable incident between the two took place at Highbury in 2005 at the height of an extreme period of bad blood between United and Arsenal. Vieira was seen confronting United defender Gary Neville in the tunnel before the game over his fouling of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes in the previous encounter between the two sides,[54] prompting Keane to verbally confront the Arsenal captain.[50]\n\nThe incident was broadcast live on Sky Sports,[55] with Keane heard telling match referee Graham Poll to, \"Tell him [Vieira] to shut his fucking mouth!\" After the game, which United won 4\u20132, Keane controversially criticised Vieira's decision to play internationally for France instead of his country of birth, Senegal. Vieira, however, later suggested that having walked out on his national team in the FIFA World Cup finals, Keane was not in a good position to comment on such matters.[56] Referee Poll later revealed that he should have sent off both players before the match had begun, though was under pressure not to do so.[54]\n\nOverall, Keane led United to nine major honours, making him the most successful captain in the club's history. Keane scored his 50th goal for Manchester United on 5 February 2005 in a league game against Birmingham City. His appearance in the 2005 FA Cup final, which United lost to Arsenal in a penalty shoot-out, was his seventh such game, a record in English football at the time.[57]\n\nKeane also jointly holds the record for the most red cards received in English football, being dismissed a total of 13 times in his career. He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2004 in recognition of his impact on the English game and became the only Irish player to be selected into the FIFA 100, a list of the greatest living footballers picked by Pel\u00e9.\n\nKeane unexpectedly left Manchester United by mutual consent on 18 November 2005,[58] during a protracted absence from the team due to an injury sustained in his last competitive game for the club,[59] caused by a robust challenge from Luis Garc\u00eda against Liverpool. His departure marked the climax of increasing tensions between Keane and the United management and players since the club's pre-season training camp in Portugal when he argued with Ferguson over the quality of the set-up at the resort.[60] Ferguson was angered further by Keane's admission during an MUTV phone-in that he would be \"prepared to play elsewhere\"[61] after the expiration of his current contract with United at the end of the season.\n\nAnother of Keane's appearances on MUTV provoked more controversy, when, after a 4\u20131 defeat at the hands of Middlesbrough in early November, he criticised the performances of John O'Shea, Alan Smith, Kieran Richardson and Darren Fletcher.[62] Of the club's record signing Rio Ferdinand, he said, \"Just because you are paid \u00a3120,000-a-week and play well for 20 minutes against Tottenham, you think you are a superstar.\"[63] The outburst was deemed too damning by the United management and was subsequently pulled from transmission by the club's TV station. Keane's opinions were described by those present at the interview as \"explosive even by his standards\".[62]\n\nKeane scored 33 league goals for Manchester United and a total of 51 in all competitions.[64] The first two of his goals for the club came in the 3\u20130 home win over Sheffield United in the Premier League on 18 August 1993,[65] the last on 12 March 2005 in a 4\u20130 away win over Southampton in the FA Cup.[66]\n\nTwo weeks later, after another row with Ferguson, Keane reached an agreement with Manchester United allowing him to leave the club immediately to sign a long-term deal with another club.[63] He was offered a testimonial in recognition of his 12-and-a-half years at Old Trafford, with both Ferguson and United chief executive David Gill wishing him well for the future.[63]\n\nKeane, in an interview with the Irish media company, Off the Ball, in September 2019, stated that Manchester United were pushing to get him out of the club because he was getting old and his strained relationship with then assistant manager Carlos Queiroz and later on with Sir Alex Ferguson, rather than the mere MUTV incident.[67]\n\nKeane's testimonial took place at Old Trafford on 9 May 2006 between United and Celtic. The home side won the game 1\u20130, with Keane playing the first half for Celtic and the second half in his former role as Manchester United captain.[68] The capacity crowd of 69,591 remains the largest crowd ever for a testimonial match in England.[69] All of the revenue generated from the match was given to Keane's favourite charity, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.\n\nOn 15 December 2005, Keane was announced as a Celtic player, the team he had supported as a child.[70] Initial reports suggested Keane was offered a contract of around \u00a340,000 per week; however, this was rejected by the player himself in his second autobiography, in which he claimed he was only paid \u00a315,000 per week while a Celtic player.[71]\nKeane's Celtic career began in January 2006, when the Glasgow giants crashed to a 2\u20131 defeat to Scottish First Division side Clyde in the third round of the Scottish Cup. His abrasive style had not dwindled, as he was seen criticising some of his new team-mates during the match.[72] Keane scored what turned out to be his only Celtic goal a month later, a shot from 20 yards in a 2\u20131 Scottish Premier League victory over Falkirk.[73] He retained his place the following Sunday in his first Old Firm derby against Rangers, leading Celtic to victory. Celtic went on to complete a double of the Scottish Premier League title and Scottish League Cup, his last honour as a player.\n\nOn 12 June 2006, Keane announced his retirement from professional football on medical advice,[74] only six months after joining Celtic. His announcement prompted glowing praise from many of his former colleagues and managers, not least from Sir Alex Ferguson, who opined, \"Over the years when they start picking the best teams of all time, he will be in there.\"[74]\n\nKeane was part of the squad that participated in the 1988 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship although he did not play.[75] He was man of the match for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 team when they beat hosts Hungary in the 1990 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship to qualify for the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship.[76]\n\nWhen called up for his first game at the international level, an under-21s match against Turkey in 1991, Keane took an immediate dislike to the organisation and preparation surrounding the Irish team, later describing the set-up as \"a bit of a joke\".[12] He would continue to hold this view throughout the remainder of his time spent with the national team, which led to numerous confrontations with the Irish management. Keane declared his unavailability to travel with the Irish squad to Algeria, but was surprised when manager Jack Charlton told him that he would never play for Ireland again if he refused to join up with his compatriots.[12] Despite this threat, Keane chose to stay at home on the insistence of Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough, and was pleased when a year later he was called up to the Irish squad for a friendly at Lansdowne Road. After more appearances, he grew to disapprove of Charlton's style of football, which relied less on the players' skill and more on continuous pressing and direct play. Tensions between the two men peaked during a pre-season tournament in the United States when Charlton berated Keane for returning home late after a drinking session with Steve Staunton.[12]\n\nKeane was included in the Republic of Ireland senior squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the U.S. and played in every game, including a famous 1\u20130 victory over tournament favourites and eventual runners-up Italy. Despite a second-round exit at the hands of the Netherlands, the tournament was considered a success for the Irish team, and Keane was named the best player of Ireland's campaign. Keane, however, was reluctant to join the post-tournament celebrations, later claiming that, as far as he was concerned, Ireland's World Cup was a disappointment: \"There was nothing to celebrate. We achieved little.\"[12]\n\nKeane missed crucial matches during the 1998 World Cup qualification matches due to a severe knee injury but came back to captain the team to within a whisker of qualification for UEFA Euro 2000, losing to Turkey in a play-off. Ireland secured qualification for the 2002 World Cup under new manager Mick McCarthy, greatly assisted by several match-winning performances from Keane. In the process of qualification, Ireland went undefeated, both home and away, against international football heavyweights Portugal and the Netherlands, famously beating the latter 1\u20130 at Lansdowne Road.\n\nThe Football Association of Ireland (FAI) selected the training base intended for use during Ireland's World Cup campaign. During the first training session, Keane expressed serious misgivings about the adequacy of the training facilities and the standard of preparation for the Irish team. He was angered by the late arrival of the squad's training equipment, which had disrupted the first training session on a pitch that he described as \"like a car park\".[77]\n\nAfter a row with goalkeeping coach Packie Bonner and Alan Kelly Jr. on the second day of training, Keane announced that he was quitting the squad and that he wished to return home to Manchester due to his dissatisfaction with Ireland's preparation. The FAI was unable to get Keane an immediate flight home at such short notice, meaning that he remained in Saipan for another night, but they called up Colin Healy as a replacement for him. The following day, however, McCarthy approached Keane and asked him to return to the training camp, and Keane was eventually persuaded to stay.\n\nDespite a temporary cooling of tensions in the Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took a turn for the worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved to know what was going on inside the camp.[12] He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: \"Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks.\"[40][78] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that \"Roy Keane's 10-minute oration [against Mick McCarthy, above] ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society.\" But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, \"[He] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back.\"[79]\n\nNone of Keane's teammates voiced support for him during the meeting, although some supported him in private afterwards. Veterans Niall Quinn and Steve Staunton backed McCarthy in a press conference after the event. It was here that McCarthy announced that he had dismissed Keane from the squad and sent him home.[80][81] By this time, the FIFA deadline for naming the World Cup squads had passed, meaning that Colin Healy was unable to be named as Keane's replacement and could not play in the tournament.\n\nMick McCarthy resigned as Ireland manager in November 2002 after defeats to Russia and Switzerland in qualification for Euro 2004. The possibility of Keane returning to the squad for future qualifiers was raised, as Keane had not yet fully retired from international football, insisting that McCarthy's presence was the main incentive for staying away from the Irish squad.[82] McCarthy's replacement, Brian Kerr, discussed with Keane the possibility of a recall, and in April 2004 he was brought back into the Irish team to face Romania on 27 May. Keane was not reinstated as captain, however, as Kerr decided to keep the armband with Kenny Cunningham. After the team's failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, he announced his retirement from international football to help prolong his club career.[83]\n\nKeane has reiterated his displeasure with the attitude and selection policy of the FAI. In March 2007, Keane claimed that several Republic of Ireland players get picked solely based on their media exposure and that the organisation was biased towards players originating from Dublin or other regions of Leinster: \"Once you keep playing them on the reputation they've built up through the media or because they do lots of interviews, then it's wrong. There's a fine line between loyalty and stupidity.\"[84] Keane claimed that Sunderland player Liam Miller was not picked because he was from Cork and that players with significant potential were failing to get picked for the national team. He also alleged that the FAI were incompetent in the running of their affairs.\n\nKeane was involved in further controversy in the wake of Ireland's defeat by France in the qualification 2010 World Cup play-off. During an Ipswich Town press conference on 20 November 2009, Keane was critical of the Irish reaction to the Thierry Henry handball incident. His response included criticisms of the Irish team's defence and the FAI authorities.\n\nKeane's former manager Sir Alex Ferguson had previously said that he wanted Keane to succeed him as Manchester United coach when he retired. In the wake of Keane's acrimonious departure from the club, however, Ferguson became evasive regarding Keane's prospects as a manager: \"Young managers come along and people say this one will be England manager or boss of this club, but two years later they're not there. It's not an easy environment to come into, I wouldn't forecast anything.\"[85]\n\nDuring his time at Celtic, Keane was suggested as a potential managerial successor to Gordon Strachan by former Celtic player Charlie Nicholas.[86] However, it was Championship club Sunderland where Keane chose to launch his managerial career, reuniting him with the club's chairman and outgoing manager, Niall Quinn. The two men, publicly at least, were on opposing sides during the fall-out from the Saipan incident, but they were on good terms at the time of the managerial appointment, with Quinn urging Sunderland fans to \"support and enjoy one of football's true greats\".[87]\n\nKeane signed a three-year deal immediately after Sunderland's victory over West Bromwich Albion on 28 August, the Mackems' first win of the 2006\u201307 season after a dreadful run of four consecutive defeats under Quinn's temporary management. With his new club sitting in the relegation zone already, second bottom of the Championship table, Keane chose to enforce changes quickly. His first actions as manager were deciding to keep the existing assistant manager, Bobby Saxton, and to appoint his former Nottingham Forest colleague Tony Loughlan as head coach. He wasted no time in bringing in new additions to the squad, with a total of six players signing on the final day of the August transfer window. The most notable signings were Keane's former Manchester United teammates Dwight Yorke[88] and Liam Miller,[89] supported by former Celtic colleagues Ross Wallace and Stanislav Varga,\n[90] as well as Wigan Athletic pair Graham Kavanagh and David Connolly.[91]\n\nKeane's first two games as manager could not have gone much better; first coming from behind to beat Derby County 2\u20131, followed by an easy 3\u20130 victory over Leeds United. Sunderland began to steadily creep up the league standings under Keane's management, and by the turn of the year, they had escaped the bottom half of the league. Five further players were signed during the January 2007 transfer window, three (Anthony Stokes, Carlos Edwards and Stern John) on permanent contracts and two (Jonny Evans and Danny Simpson) on loan from Manchester United, Keane's old club. Results continued to improve, and Keane was rewarded with the February and March Manager of the Month awards,[92] while his team began to challenge for the automatic promotion places. Meanwhile, Keane tackled his players' non-professional approach with a firm hand. When three players were late for the team coach to a trip to Barnsley, in March 2007, he simply left them behind.[93]\n\nSunderland secured promotion to the Premier League \u2013 along with Birmingham City \u2013 on 29 April when rivals Derby were beaten by Crystal Palace.[94] A week later, the Championship title was sealed, and Sunderland's revival under Keane was complete. His achievements also earned him the Championship Manager of the Year award.[95]\n\nThe lowest point of their next season came at Goodison Park, where they were beaten 7\u20131 by Everton, which Keane described as \"one of the lowest points\" of his career. In the second half of the season, however, the team's form was much improved (especially at home) and survival in the division was guaranteed with two games to go with a home win against Middlesbrough. Meanwhile, Keane carried on his trend of buying ex-Manchester United players with the addition of Kieran Richardson, Paul McShane, Danny Higginbotham and Phil Bardsley. He has also continued his strict disciplinary policy by putting Liam Miller (one of Sunderland's more consistent players) on the transfer list for being regularly late for training and other team meetings.\n\nThe beginning of the 2008\u201309 season would prove to be tumultuous. In September 2008 Keane became embroiled in a row with FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner over the withdrawal of Dwight Yorke from the Trinidad and Tobago national team. Warner accused Keane of being disrespectful towards small countries.[96] Keane responded by calling Warner \"a clown\" and insisted that Yorke was retired from international football.[97] That same month Keane experienced \"one of the worst and longest nights\" of his career when Sunderland had to come from 2\u20130 down at home in a League Cup tie against Northampton Town. The game ended 2\u20132, with Sunderland progressing narrowly on penalties.[98]\n\nDespite some positive performances, including the historic 2\u20131 home victory against local rivals Newcastle United on 25 October (the first time the club had accomplished this in 28 years),[99] as well as good showings by recent signings like Djibril Ciss\u00e9 and Anton Ferdinand, the team's general form, remained inconsistent. By the end of November, Sunderland was 18th in the Premier League, having lost five of their six previous games. Keane stood down as manager on 4 December after bringing doubt on his future with comments made in the wake of the 4\u20131 home defeat by Bolton Wanderers the previous weekend.[100] Keane's harsh management style was not appreciated by the Sunderland players, who were reported to have celebrated when they heard he had resigned.[101]\n\nIn an interview with The Irish Times on 21 February 2009, Keane cited differences with Sunderland 30% shareholder Ellis Short and strains with club chairman Niall Quinn as the factors in his decision to resign as Sunderland manager.[102]\n\nOn 23 April 2009, Keane was appointed as the new manager of Ipswich Town on a two-year contract,[103] the day after the club had dismissed Jim Magilton.[103] His first game in charge came the following Saturday with a 3\u20130 away win over Cardiff City, the final league match to be played at Ninian Park.[104] The following week, Ipswich rounded off the season with a 2\u20131 win over Coventry City.[105] In the 2009\u201310 season, Keane started to sign some players, some of them from his former club Sunderland. He signed goalkeeper M\u00e1rton F\u00fcl\u00f6p, midfielders Carlos Edwards and Grant Leadbitter and brought in Jack Colback, David Healy and Daryl Murphy on loan to the club. Ipswich started without a win in their first 14 matches, making them the last team to record their first win in the whole league, finally winning on 31 October against Derby County and recording their first away win of the season on 29 November against Cardiff City. Their form gradually improved throughout the season, but Ipswich drew far too many games to come anywhere near the promotion race and they finished the season in 15th place.[106] Many inconsistencies in the 2009\u201310 and the 2010\u201311 season meant that Keane's Ipswich side never really challenged for promotions and as a result of a poor run of form, ending up with his side dropping to as low as 21st in the Championship. Keane was dismissed as Ipswich manager on 7 January 2011.[10]\n\nOn 5 November 2013, the FAI announced that Martin O'Neill had been made the Republic of Ireland manager and that Keane had been made the assistant manager.[107] Their first match was against Latvia at the Aviva Stadium in a 3\u20130 victory on 15 November 2013.[108] After Neil Lennon left Celtic at the end of the 2013\u201314 season, Keane looked set to become the new manager of the Hoops. Martin O'Neill admitted he won't stand in his way of taking over the reins at Celtic Park.[109] Keane, however, remained as assistant manager of Ireland and asked not to be considered for the job.[110] Keane later stated that he was on the verge of taking the Celtic job and had met with the Celtic owner Dermot Desmond but felt \"they didn't make him feel wanted enough\" and rejected the offer.[111]\nKeane later became the new assistant manager of Aston Villa, combining his role with Villa and Ireland.[112]\n\nIn October 2014, Keane caused controversy after his book was released before crucial Euro 2016 qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany. Martin O'Neill, however, rejected the claims that it was a distraction.[113]\n\nA month later, before Ireland's crucial qualifier against Scotland, Keane was involved in an incident with a fan in the team hotel. An ambulance for the fan was called as well as the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, but no arrests or complaints were made.[114] The FAI and Martin O'Neill came out in support of Keane after the incident.[115] It later emerged that CCTV footage exonerated Keane of any wrongdoing. The man involved in the incident is Brendan Grace's son-in-law Frank Gillespie, who is believed to have asked Keane to sign a copy of Keane's autobiography The Second Half. Keane refused to do so, and Gillespie confronted Keane but then collapsed and an ambulance was called to the hotel. Grace stated that Gillespie and Keane were \"old buddies\".[116][117]\n\nAfter the Scotland game, Keane claimed that Everton were putting pressure on the Irish players like S\u00e9amus Coleman and James McCarthy (who missed the Scotland match through injury) to pull out of international squads; Everton chairman Bill Kenwright refuted this claim, saying Keane says \"stupid things\". Then-Everton manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez also dismissed Keane's comments.[118][119]\n\nAgain Keane was in the headlines after a heated press conference with journalists before the United States match. Keane got in a row with a journalist after he was questioned if he was becoming a distraction from the Republic of Ireland cause.[120] Eamon Dunphy has called on the FAI and Martin O'Neill to stop Keane from giving interviews to end the circus of media attention around him.[121]\n\nIn November 2018, Keane and O'Neill left their jobs by \"mutual agreement\".[11]\n\nOn 1 July 2014, Keane was confirmed as Aston Villa's new assistant manager, working alongside manager Paul Lambert. He combined this role with his assistant manager's role with the Republic of Ireland.[122] On 28 November 2014, however, Keane quit his role as assistant manager at Aston Villa to concentrate on his assistant manager role with Ireland.[123]\n\nIn January 2019 he became assistant manager at Nottingham Forest,[124] leaving the role in June 2019.[125]\n\nKeane has done media work but expressed his lack of enthusiasm to do so again in the future when he said, \"I was asked last week by ITV to do the Celtic game. A couple of weeks before that I was asked to do the United game against Celtic at Old Trafford. I think I've done it once for Sky. Never again. I'd rather go to the dentist. You're sitting there with people like Richard Keys and they're trying to sell something that's not there. Any time I watch a game on television I have to turn the commentators off.\"[126]\n\nKeane later had a change of heart. Along with Harry Redknapp and Gareth Southgate (who had previously been stamped on by Keane during an FA Cup semi-final in 1995, leading to a red card), he was a pundit for ITV's coverage of the Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona.[127] In the 2011\u201312 season, he became ITV chief football analyst, appearing on nearly every Live ITV match alongside presenter Adrian Chiles and Gareth Southgate. He appeared on ITV in the Champions League including Chelsea's victory in the final against Bayern Munich, nearly all FA Cup matches including the final between Chelsea and Liverpool at Wembley, and England competitive internationals and friendlies. He was also involved in the ITV team for Euro 2012 alongside long-time rival Patrick Vieira and they appeared together as pundits in Ireland\u2013Spain match and Czech Republic\u2013Russia match, also appearing with Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Gordon Strachan. Keane worked for ITV during his time as Republic of Ireland Assistant on UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League highlights shows between 2015-2018 but didn't appear on International Football apart from on the Final of UEFA Euro 2016, he covered 2018 FIFA World Cup & UEFA Euro 2020 for ITV Sport and appeared again on England Qualifiers from 2018, in 2021-2022 he became ITV chief analyst for FA Cup appearing alongside Ian Wright.[128]\n\nKeane joined Sky Sports to work on Super Sunday starting in September 2019.[129]\n\nKeane married Theresa Doyle in 1997,[130] and they have five children named Shannon, Caragh, Aidan, Leah, and Alanna.[131]\n\nWhen Keane joined Manchester United, the family lived in a modern four-bedroom house in Bowdon, then moved to a mock Tudor mansion in Hale.[132][133] His family then had a 1930s-built home bulldozed so they could build a new \u00a32.5\u00a0million house near Hale.[134]\n\nOn 6 June 2009, it was announced that Keane and his family would purchase a house in the Ipswich area, near to the training ground of Keane's new club, Ipswich Town.[135] He eventually settled in the nearby market town of Woodbridge.[136] They moved out of the property and offered it for sale in 2015.[137]\n\nIn October 2014, Keane released the second part of his autobiography The Second Half, which was ghostwritten by Roddy Doyle.[138] It is the follow up to his first autobiography, released in 2002, which was ghost written by Eamon Dunphy.[139][140]\n\nKeane had a Labrador Retriever named Triggs, who died in 2012.[141] Speaking in Dublin at his annual visit to the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, he spoke on the loss affecting him, \"Triggs was great and went through a lot with me... you will have me crying in a minute, so be careful. She had a good life.\"[141] Triggs came to international attention in 2002 during the Saipan incident ahead of that year's FIFA World Cup, which saw Keane engage in a public quarrel and leave the squad. He said of Triggs, \"Unlike humans, dogs don't talk shit.\"[142]\n\nThe Daily Telegraph's Steve Wilson once described Triggs as \"the most famous dog in football since Pickles, a mongrel who dug up the stolen Jules Rimet Trophy in 1966, or that dog that relieved itself on Jimmy Greaves at the 1962 World Cup\".[143] Henry Winter, writing in the same paper and noting Keane's tendency to go for long walks with his dog in the wake of controversial incidents, called Triggs \"the fittest dog in Cheshire\" and opined that \"if Cruft's (sic) held an endurance event, Keane and Triggs would scoop gold\".[144]\n\nFollowing her rise to fame, Triggs was mentioned by several sources on many occasions, with Keane followed by numerous canine references and dog puns for the remainder of his career.[145][146][147][148][149][150][151][152] In 2006 when Keane moved house to Sunderland, his reunion with Triggs, who joined him later, came to the notice of the press.[153] In 2007, Keane was reported to have heard of his team's promotion to the Premiership while walking Triggs.[154] The following year, Keane was said to have acquired a German Shepherd Dog named Izac to accompany Triggs.[155][156][157]\n\nIn later life, Triggs was involved in a police investigation when her behaviour caused an argument between Keane and a neighbour.[158] She appeared in an Irish Guide Dogs advertisement in 2009, whereupon the Irish Examiner referred to her as \"football's biggest canine celebrity\",[159] and also received her own profile on Facebook.[158] Triggs was described as a \"celebrity\" and a \"household name\" upon erroneous reports of her death from cancer in September 2010.[158] Keane was described as \"inconsolable\".[158] The Irish Examiner's obituary noted how \"at critical moments when the nation's happiness seemed entwined with Roy's moods, he turned to his Labrador Triggs and took to the road\".[160]\n\nA powerful, dominant, consistent, and highly competitive midfielder, in his prime, Keane was known for his work-rate, mobility, energy, physicality, and hard-tackling style of play, which earned him a reputation as one of the best players in the world in his position. His playing style also earned him a degree of notoriety, due to his temper, tendency to pick up cards, confront opponents, and commit rash challenges. Usually operating in either a holding or box-to-box role in the centre of the pitch, his most prominent traits were his stamina, intelligence, positional sense, tenacity, aggression, physical strength, and ball-winning abilities, although he was a complete midfielder, who possessed a wide range of skills; indeed, he was also capable of carrying the ball forward effectively after obtaining possession, and either distributing it to other players, controlling the game and dictating the tempo in midfield, starting attacking plays, or even creating chances for his teammates, courtesy of his composure on the ball, first touch, and precise, efficient passing. He could even score goals himself, due to his attacking drive, eye for goal, a powerful shot from range, and his ability to make late runs into the penalty area, in particular in his early career.\n\nIn his later career, however, he became more cautious in his play, and occupied a deeper role, in order to compensate for his physical decline. An influential presence on the pitch, in addition to his playing ability, Keane also stood out for his leadership and determination throughout his career, as well as his strong character. However, he also struggled out with injuries throughout his career.[nb 1] Despite his relatively small frame and short stature, he was also good in the air and an accurate header of the ball.[169][170][173][177][178] Although he was usually fielded as a defensive midfielder, Keane was also deployed as a defender on occasion, functioning as a centre-back or as a sweeper.[176][179]\n\nRegarding his work-rate, mentality, and influence, his former teammate Gary Neville said of him: \"His greatest gift was to create a standard of performance which demanded the very best from the team. You would look at him busting a gut and feel that you'd be betraying him if you didn't give everything yourself.\"[168] Steve McClaren, who served as Alex Ferguson's assistant manager during Keane's time at Manchester United, between 1998 and 2001, instead said of the midfielder's competitive spirit: \"He mirrors the manager on the pitch. They are winners.\"[169] Regarding Keane's complex character, despite his intensity on the pitch, Sean O'Hagan of The Guardian wrote in 2002 that he is \"...a committed and confident warrior on the field, a shy, socially awkward, and often lonely introvert off it.\"[180]\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nManchester United\n\nCeltic\n\nIndividual\n\nSunderland\n\nIndividual\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane"}, {"id": 58, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/96/1916567/original/robbie-savage-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Robbie Savage", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/robbie-savage/1916567", "desc": "Robert William Savage (born 18 October 1974) is a Welsh football pundit and former player.

He became a regular for Leicester City in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and performed a similar role for Birmingham City and Blackburn Rovers. In 2008, he joined Derby County; after a short loan spell with Brighton & Hove Albion later that year, he returned to captain Derby, with whom he finished his playing career. He also played for the Wales national team on 39 occasions. He is now a pundit for the BBC and regularly presents 606 on BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday evenings. He also co-presents Early Kick Off on BT Sport.\n\nBorn in Wrexham, Savage started his playing career with local sides Brickfield Rangers[3] and Lex XI.[3][4] When he finished school, he joined Manchester United as a trainee and originally played as a striker. He played in the FA Youth Cup winning team of 1992, and was later given a professional contract, but never played a first-team game for the club and signed for Crewe Alexandra in 1994.[5]\n\nHe switched into midfield early in his time at Crewe and proved himself as a competent young player, helping them reach the Division Two play-offs in his first two seasons at the club; a remarkable feat for a newly promoted club who had only played at this level twice in the previous 30 years. Crewe then made it third time lucky by sealing promotion via the play-offs in 1997. It was the first time that Crewe had reached the second tier of the English football league system, but shortly after helping Crewe win promotion, Savage handed in a transfer request to manager Dario Gradi.\n\n Savage was transferred to Premier League side Leicester City managed by Martin O'Neill, for a fee of \u00a3400,000, in July 1997. Savage spent five years at Leicester, where he made his name as a reliable, competitive and fiery midfielder. In 1999, Leicester reached the League Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur. In a controversial incident, Savage made a poor tackle on Tottenham's Justin Edinburgh who retaliated by swinging his arm out. Contact was minimal, but Savage fell to the ground. Edinburgh was sent off for raising his arms, and although Tottenham went on to win the final, many Spurs fans still hold a grudge against Savage for the incident to this day. However, a year later Savage reached the League Cup final again, this time winning 2\u20131 against Tranmere Rovers.\n\nWhen Leicester were relegated from the Premiership at the end of the 2001\u201302 season he transferred to newly promoted Birmingham City for a fee of \u00a31.25\u00a0million, signing a three-year contract.[6] He won the club's Player of the Year award in 2003.[7] At the beginning of January 2005 he submitted a written request for a transfer, allegedly wishing to be nearer his ailing parents in Wrexham. On 19 January, he completed a move to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of \u00a33\u00a0million, having scored 11 goals in 82 league games for Birmingham.\n\nIn his first five months as a Blackburn player, Savage helped his new club to Premier League safety and reached the FA Cup Semi-final, a 3\u20130 loss to Arsenal in his homeland's Millennium Stadium.\n\nIn March, Savage called an end to his international career after new manager John Toshack dropped him for a World Cup 2006 qualifying game against Austria.[8] His feud with Toshack and the Welsh FA continued long into the 2005\u201306 season as Savage insisted he retired from international football only because Toshack told him he was not good enough to play for Wales.[9]\n\nIn 2005\u201306, Savage was a regular performer for Blackburn, making 42 appearances and scoring once,[10] against former club Birmingham.[11] The following season, he scored against Salzburg[12] and Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w[13] in Rovers' UEFA Cup campaign, but his season was cut short by a broken leg in January, which kept him out for the rest of the season.[14]\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, Savage endured further problems with his knee, suffering a knock in the 2\u20131 win at Spurs after being caught by Robbie Keane. Surgery was required which kept him out of the starting lineup for six weeks. Following the return of Steven Reid to the Rovers starting lineup and some good form by David Dunn, he found it harder to get into the starting XI. Savage was well liked by the Blackburn fans and was given a standing ovation by a near capacity ground by the Rovers fans when he returned with Derby.[15]\n\nIt was revealed by then Sunderland manager Roy Keane in his 2014 autobiography, that he had been given permission by Blackburn to sign Savage during the end of his time at Blackburn; however he was put off by Savage's \"wazzupp\" voicemail, with Keane describing his thoughts after hearing this as \"I can't be fucking signing that\".[16]\n\nOn 9 January 2008, Savage joined Derby County for a fee of \u00a31.5\u00a0million on a two-and-a-half-year contract,[17] and later revealed that he had taken a pay cut to join Derby in his search for first-team football and had rejected a move to Sunderland because he felt Derby had wanted him more.[18] As the number 8 shirt, which he had worn at previous clubs, was already allocated to then-captain Matthew Oakley, he took the number 44 shirt because the numbers add up to 8.[19] He was appointed the new Derby captain after Oakley was sold to Leicester, and he skippered the Derby side in his first match, a 1\u20130 home defeat to Wigan Athletic.[20]\n\nRumours of Savage leaving Derby came in July 2008 when he missed out on every pre-season match. In August, Leicester City chairman Milan Mandaric declared an interest in Savage, which was dismissed by Derby.[21] Paul Jewell repeatedly left Savage out of the team, after Derby's poor start to the 2008\u20132009 season,[22] and he was replaced as captain by Alan Stubbs. Stubbs was forced to retire shortly into the new season through injury, but Savage was not considered for the role due to not being in the first team, and the armband went to Paul Connolly.\n\nAfter failing to break back into the first team, Savage was sent out on loan in October to Brighton for a month to keep match fit.[23] He would later reveal one year later, in a build-up to a match between Leicester and Derby County, that he had tried to secure a loan deal to the Walkers Stadium (Leicester had declared an interest in him months earlier). Savage even telephoned club ambassador Alan Birchenall and former teammate Paul Dickov to put in a good word with manager Nigel Pearson. Pearson, however, \"said no\", despite Derby offering to pay \"90 or 95 per-cent\" of Savage's wages.[24] Following Jewell's resignation as Derby manager, Savage found himself brought back into first team contention by new manager Nigel Clough, who made him first choice in central midfield. Savage scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20131 loss to Doncaster Rovers on 27 February 2009.[25]\n\nSavage signed a one-year extension to his Derby contract with the club on 10 August 2009 to take him through to the end of the 2010\u201311 season. The next day, he was named in the Championship Team of the Week for his performance in the opening day victory over Peterborough United.[26] Later that month, Savage was renamed as Captain of Derby County, replacing Paul Connolly, who manager Nigel Clough wanted to \"concentrate on his own game\".[27] In response, Savage said that: \"I did not deserve the captaincy when I first came to the club. I was handed it from the first day and I shouldn't have been. It was too much pressure for me and I had a nightmare. I let it get to me. I think I'm ready for it now. I feel more comfortable with it now.\"[28] Derby struggled once again during the season, not achieving safety until the 44th fixture, but the season was a personal success for Savage as he appeared in all but one of Derby's 51 league and cup fixtures during the campaign, the match which he missed being due to suspension, starting 49 of them. He also scored twice; a free kick against Queens Park Rangers in a 4\u20132 home defeat and a volley at Sheffield United in a 1\u20131 draw. He also won the club's own Player of the Year award[29] but lost out on the fan's award to Shaun Barker.[30]\n\nSavage again started in the Derby first XI in the 2010\u201311 season in a new 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation around new signing James Bailey, though Derby got off to a poor start winning just one of their opening seven league games, with Savage's form making fans question the justification for his place in the team and his status as skipper.[31] He made his 100th appearance for the club in a 2\u20132 draw against Queens Park Rangers before he was dropped to the bench for a 1\u20131 draw at Barnsley, the first game he had played no part in for Derby (barring unavailability for selection) since Nigel Clough's arrival as manager in January 2009.\n\nSavage played in goal for Derby on 11 March 2010, when Stephen Bywater was taken off with a back injury against Reading. He let in two goals during his 45 minutes in the Derby goal.[32]\n\nOn 16 October 2010, Savage played his 600th career match in a 3\u20130 victory on Preston North End, scoring an injury-time penalty to seal the win.[33] In January 2011, Savage revealed that he was considering leaving the club for a move to Vancouver Whitecaps, Savage stating: \"One thing is for sure, I will be leaving Derby County at the end of the season, if not before, even if they offer me a new contract. My time is up here. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with Derby and I want to walk away with my head held high\".[34] One fan responded by telephoning Savage during an interview on Radio Five Live and telling him to \"leave the club now\" and \"take young Mr. Clough with him\".[35] Savage eventually rejected the move, stating it was too big a move for his family.[36] On 31 January 2011, Savage announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season to concentrate on his growing media career.[37] In his last two games, a home loss against Bristol City and an away defeat at Reading, he was met with a round of applause and a standing ovation from both sets of supporters.\n\nOn 24 November 2019, Savage came out of retirement to join Stockport Town of the North West Counties League.[38] He made his league debut for the club the following evening, as an 80th-minute substitute in a 3\u20132 victory over FC Oswestry Town.[39] That was his only appearance.[40]\n\nSavage played at under-18 and under-21 level for Wales[41] before making his senior international debut in 1995 against Albania while at Crewe. Savage attained 39 caps, scoring two goals, both in World Cup qualifying against Turkey and Norway, before retiring from international football in September 2005, saying he wished to concentrate on his club career.[42] However, many people believe the reason he quit was due to a spat with Wales manager John Toshack. Savage did give the explanation that \"John Toshack said it was my way or the highway \u2013 well I'm on the M56.\"[43]\n\nOn 6 March 2006, he appeared on Welsh radio, partaking in a debate with pundit Leighton James over his exclusion from the Wales squad. Early in his international career he clashed with former Wales manager Bobby Gould when he jokingly threw a replica of Paolo Maldini's shirt into a disposal bin before a match against Italy.[44] Savage was initially dropped by Gould from the squad only to be reinstated the next day.[44]\n\nSavage's style as a midfield player was all-action and energetic, and he regularly collected yellow cards, and for a while held the dubious distinction of being awarded the most yellow cards of any Premiership player in the league's history \u2013 89, although he has now been overtaken by Lee Bowyer, Kevin Davies and Paul Scholes.[45] Fans of Aston Villa, Tottenham, West Ham and Arsenal have accused him of simulation, whether to win a set piece or to get an opponent red carded.[46]\n\nDuring a match against Newcastle United in August 2003, the referee Matt Messias swung his arm out and accidentally hit Savage in the face as Savage was running behind him.[47] On 17 January 2010, whilst commentating for BBC Radio 5 Live's coverage of a Premier League match between Aston Villa and West Ham United at Villa Park, a clearance by Villa midfielder Stiliyan Petrov hit Savage in the face causing some minor bleeding to the nose.[48]\n\nSavage has, however, only been sent off twice in his career: once during an international game for the Welsh national team, and once during a Premier League game for Blackburn. He received his first-ever red card when he was sent off in Wales' World Cup qualification match against Northern Ireland in September 2004 for reacting to a foul on him by midfielder Michael Hughes. Both Hughes and Savage were sent off, but, on later review, the punishment of Savage seemed harsh to some.[who?] Savage was ridiculed for threatening to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights over the decision.[citation needed] His once-impressive statistic of never being sent off in a Premiership match ended on 18 March 2006 when he was dismissed against Middlesbrough for two bookable offences. Both were controversial \u2013 the first for a challenge on George Boateng where he appeared to take the ball, and the second for handball when it seemed unintentional.[citation needed] Savage later admitted that he was probably due a controversial sending off because he had escaped punishment for illegal challenges in the past.\n\nOne famous example of his eccentric behaviour was while he played for Leicester City. In an incident to become known as \"Poogate\" he used the referee's toilet before a game, claiming he had an upset stomach due to antibiotics he was on at the time. The Football Association charged him and he was fined \u00a310,000, a decision that he appealed against, but lost. Leicester fined him two weeks' wages for the incident.[49][50]\n\nWhilst playing for Leicester, in the final minute of a league game between rivals Leicester and Derby at Pride Park in 2001, Savage dived in the penalty area. Leicester were awarded the penalty, which was converted, and meant they won the game 3\u20132. Savage's blatant dive, his hopeful look at the referee and his aggressive fist-pumping celebration in front of the home fans resulted in a torrent of abuse from the fans and in Savage being chased across the pitch by incensed Derby players, two of whom were booked. Derby fans regularly booed, jeered and abused Savage whenever he played against them, and when he became a Derby player in January 2008, he was treated with a mixture of hostility and indifference, partly over the incident, and partly over his average form.[51][52][53]\n\nSavage is also famous for an incident at Villa Park, while playing for Birmingham City, in a bad-tempered Second City derby in March 2003. After a slide tackle on him by Dion Dublin, a confrontation between the two and several other players occurred before Dublin headbutted Savage. Dublin was then sent off by referee Mark Halsey as result.[54] Birmingham would go on to win the derby 0\u20132.\n\nWhen being interviewed by BBC Radio Derby's Colin Gibson in January 2010, Savage reacted furiously to rumours he heard that the Derby players think the club's backroom staff are not up to the job. These rumours were brought up during a phone-in on Gibson's show on the station the preceding weekend, following the Rams' 4\u20131 defeat at home to Scunthorpe United on 9 January.[55]\n\nSavage occasionally acted as a pundit during his club career,[56][57] and started working in the media more regularly in the 2009\u201310 season.[58] He worked in a number of different punditry roles during the 2010 FIFA World Cup before joining the presenting team for BBC Radio 5 Live's 6-0-6 show.[59] In September 2010, Savage signed up as official sporting ambassador for bookmakers William Hill.[60] In May 2011 he was awarded the Sony Radio Academy Rising Star Award,[61] as well as winning an award from the Plain English Campaign.[62]\n\nBetween 2009\u20132013, Savage was a pundit on ESPN, and has since moved to BT Sport.\n\nSince retiring from football in May 2011, Savage has attempted to become a more prominent broadcasting figure beyond punditry. From September 2011 Savage took part in the 2011 series of Strictly Come Dancing,[63] partnering Ola Jordan. The show broadcast on 22 October saw Savage perform a dramatic knee-slide towards the camera, which resulted in a broken nose.[64] Savage and Jordan were eliminated from the competition in the quarterfinal on 4 December 2011, placing sixth.[65]\n\nIn October 2012, along with 463 other players, Savage took part in BBC Radio 5 Live's attempt to set a new Guinness World Record for the 'most players in a continuous 5 a side exhibition match'. This was for BBC Children in Need along with comedian Lloyd Langford and BBC Radio 5 Live travel reporter Lindsey Chapman.[66][67] Along with Ex-England cricketer Andrew Flintoff, Savage is part of a BBC Radio 5 Live podcast called Flintoff, Savage & The Ping Pong Guy, hosted by former table tennis player Matthew Syed, which discussed current sporting topics.[68]\n\nSavage's involvement with Stockport Town led to him becoming involved with the creation of phoenix club Macclesfield F.C. in October 2020.[69] Macclesfield owner Robert Smethurst appointed Savage as a member of the board (later director of football) with Danny Whitaker as manager.[70] On 30 August Macclesfield defeated local rivals Congleton Town 1-0 in the NWCFL Premier Division;[71] the match was suspended for several minutes late in the second half due to crowd trouble, during which Savage intervened to break up fighting.[72]\n\nSavage was born in Wrexham on 18 October 1974, to Colin and Valerie Savage.[73] He attended Ysgol Bryn Alyn in Gwersyllt until he completed his GCSE studies in July 1991. On leaving school, Savage joined Manchester United as an apprentice.\n\nSavage and his wife Sarah have two sons.[74] In 2012 one of his sons, Charlie, was attached to Manchester United's youth academy and in April 2021 he signed his first professional contract with the club.[75][76] On 8 December 2021, Savage provided commentary for BT Sport in the match where his son Charlie made his senior Manchester United debut in the UEFA Champions League, coming on as a late substitute in a 1-1 draw against Young Boys.[77]\n\nRobbie Savage's father was diagnosed with Pick's disease, a dementia-type illness, when he was in his mid-50s, and died in 2012.[78] Savage is an ambassador for the dementia care and research charity, the Alzheimer's Society.[79]\n\nSavage had said in the future he would have liked to finish his career at home town club Wrexham before going on to manage them.[80] He also said that the greatest regret of his football career was not signing for Everton when he had the chance in 2005.[81]\n\nSavage published an autobiography in 2011, Savage!, written with Janine Self, and in 2015 published I'll Tell You What..., a book of memoir and punditry.[82][83]\n\nIn October 2014, Savage was awarded an honorary fellowship at Wrexham's Glynd\u0175r University for services to sport.[84]\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year[85]\n\nInternational goals\n\nManchester United Youth\n\nLeicester City\n\nScholastic\n\nChancellor, visitor, governor, rector and fellowships\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Savage"}, {"id": 59, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/76/1515036/original/marcel-desailly-photo-u4?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Marcel Desailly", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/marcel-desailly/1515036", "desc": "Marcel Desailly (born Odenke Abbey, French pronunciation: \u200b[ma\u0281s\u025bl d\u0259s\u0251ji]; born 7 September 1968) is a French former professional footballer who played as a centre back or defensive midfielder and was a member of the France international squads that won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.

During a successful career at club level, lasting from 1986 to 2006, Desailly won several titles, including UEFA Champions League medals with both Marseille and AC Milan, and also played for Nantes and Chelsea, among other teams. At international level, he collected 116 caps between 1993 and 2004, scoring three goals, and was a member of the France international squads that won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.\n\nMarcel Desailly was born as Odenke Abbey on 7 September 1968 in Accra, Ghana, the son of Ghanaian parents. He had his name changed when his mother married the head of the French Consulate in Accra, who adopted all of her children (the former professional footballer Seth Adonkor, seven years his elder, was a half-brother of his). The family relocated to France when Desailly was four years old. Following Adonkor's lead, he began his career at FC Nantes. There, as part of the famed FC Nantes youth programme, he played alongside a young Didier Deschamps, who became his closest friend. Desailly turned professional in 1986, two years after his half-brother had died in a car accident. In 1992, he moved to Olympique de Marseille, where he reunited with Deschamps, and won the UEFA Champions League the following year. In 1994, while playing for AC Milan, he again won the Cup (scoring in the final himself), being the first player to win the Cup in consecutive seasons with different clubs. During his time in Milan he won two Italian league titles, in 1994 and 1996. Although he preferred to be deployed as a sweeper or centre-back, roles which he played during his time in France,[4] he found much success playing as a defensive midfielder for Milan, alongside Demetrio Albertini, due to the presence of several other established centre-backs at the club, such as Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Filippo Galli.\n\nDesailly then moved to the English club Chelsea in 1998 for \u00a34.6 million,[5] where he captained the side and played sweeper and centre-back until the end of the 2003\u201304 season. It was at Chelsea that Desailly formed a formidable partnership with Frank Leboeuf.\n\nHe picked up one major trophy in his six seasons with Chelsea, being on the winning side in their FA Cup triumph over Aston Villa in 2000.[6]\n\nDesailly was snapped up by Qatari outfit Al-Gharafa in 2004. He was appointed as the club captain and under the French coach Bruno Metsu they won the Qatar League in 2005. He then joined Qatar S.C., leading them to second place in the league before retiring from professional football.\n\nIn 2014, Desailly had met the Football Association of Malaysia and said he was ready and willing to coach the Malaysia national team.[7] He also pointed that it was up to the football association whether to hire him or not.[8]\n\nDesailly has often said that he feels totally French and while having ties with Ghana, never even considered playing for a country other than France.[citation needed] During an interview in Ghana, he stated that he did not have much choice about which country to play for as he was already established in the French national youth football team.[9] This stance was restated in his autobiography, published in 2002. He made his international debut in 1993, but was not established as a first choice defender until 1996.\n\nHe was an important part of the French team which won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, albeit being sent off in the final match. Like other team members, he was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1998.[1]\n\nTwo years later success continued, as France won Euro 2000. After the tournament, Desailly was made captain of the national team, following the retirement of Didier Deschamps. In 2001, he led France to victory in the Confederations Cup.\n\nIn April 2003, Desailly surpassed the record for the number of appearances for the French team, a number which eventually reached 116 when he announced his retirement from international football following 2004 UEFA European Football Championship. However, that record was broken during the 2006 FIFA World Cup by Lilian Thuram.\n\nNicknamed \"The Rock\", due to his consistency, strength, and hard-tackling playing style, Desailly is considered one of the most accomplished players of his generation, and one of the finest French defenders ever, who stood out for his charismatic leadership and ability to organise his team's back-line and break down opposition plays throughout his career. A quick, hard-working, tenacious, and powerful player, who excelled in the air and at anticipating his opponents, he combined his aggression, stamina, and ability to read the game, as well as his physical, mental, and defensive skills, with a notable confidence and good technique on the ball, which also allowed him to play in midfield throughout his career; indeed, after moving to Milan, although he initially started out playing as a centre-back or sweeper, and occasionally even as a full-back, he was later deployed as a defensive midfielder, a position in which he also excelled, successfully filling the void left by the departure of Frank Rijkaard due his ball-winning abilities and capacity to start attacking plays after winning back possession. In addition to his defensive skills, he was also capable of contributing to his team's offensive plays with goals by making attacking runs into the box.[4][10][11][12][13] In 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 as one of the world's greatest living players.[14]\n\nMarcel Desailly is currently[when?] residing in Ghana.[15] He is currently a Laureus Academy member and OrphanAid Africa Lifetime ambassador to Ghana and France (since 2005). He was mentioned as a possible candidate for the coaching position of the Ghana national team.[16] He has since then pulled out of the race to coach the Ghana National Team, although the option is likely to keep coming up. He has opened (June 2011) a sports facility in Ghana called Lizzy Sports Complex, in memory of his late mother, geared to young players and children in particular. Many African National teams use the centre to camp and prepare for international tournaments.[17]\n\nDesailly's autobiography, Capitaine, was published in France by Stock in 2002.\n\nFollowing retirement, Desailly became a pundit for BBC Sport predominantly giving his opinion from the touchline at both half time and full-time as opposed to residing in the studio with Alan Hansen, Alan Shearer and Martin O'Neill.\n\nHe worked for BBC Sport in the United Kingdom during the 2006 World Cup, as one of their Match of the Day analysts.\n\nHe also worked for BBC Sport at the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations and Euro 2008 and is a regular commentator for French television channel Canal Plus.\n\nHe also became a spokesperson for sports betting website Betclic.[18]\n\nIn 2010 Desailly joined the ITV Sport team for their World Cup coverage from South Africa.[19][20]\n\nDesailly is a supporter of the 1GOAL Education for All campaign.[21] He is also the UNICEF national Goodwill Ambassador for Ghana.[22] He is the Lifetime Goodwill Ambassador for his personal Charity OrphanAid Africa, that helps abandoned children in Ghana. He is a member of the Laureus Sports for Good Foundation.\n\nA mobile video game entitled Marcel Desailly Pro Soccer, developed by Gameloft was released for mobile phones in 2003.[23] Desailly is an ICON in FIFA 21 Ultimate Team and FIFA 22 Ultimate Team with ratings of 87 (base), 88 (mid), 91 (prime), and 92 (Prime Icon Moments)in both games.[24]\n\nDesailly is a member of the Ga ethnic group. He is married to Virginie and has four children. His nephew James \u00c9douard Adams is a semi-professional footballer.[25]\n\nMarseille[33]\n\nAC Milan[33][34]\n\nChelsea[35]\n\nAl-Gharafa[36]\n\nFrance[35]\n\nIndividual\n\nOrders\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Desailly"}, {"id": 60, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/88/1741077/original/owen-hargreaves-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Owen Hargreaves", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/owen-hargreaves/1741077", "desc": "Owen Lee Hargreaves (born 20 January 1981) is a former footballer and current television pundit for BT Sport.

After seven years with the Munich side\u00a0\u2013 during which time he won four German league titles and the 2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League\u00a0\u2013 Hargreaves signed for Manchester United in 2007, winning the Premier League and UEFA Champions League in his first season. However, his time at Manchester United was plagued with injuries and he was allowed to leave the club at the end of his contract in June 2011. Hargreaves posted YouTube videos in a bid to convince potential suitors of his fitness, and in August 2011, Manchester City offered a one-year contract to Hargreaves, which he accepted.\n\nAs a Canadian citizen with a Welsh mother and an English father, Hargreaves was eligible to represent Canada, Wales or England. Hargreaves initially played for Wales, and was capped three times for the Wales under-19 team, but then opted to play for the England under-21 team in 2000 and was capped by the senior squad the following year. He is the only player to have played for England without having previously lived in England, and only the second, after Joe Baker, to have done so without having previously played in the English football league system.[5]\n\nHargreaves was born in Calgary, Alberta, as the youngest of three children of Margaret and Colin Hargreaves, who had emigrated from the United Kingdom at the start of the 1980s.[6] His father played football for the Bolton Wanderers youth side[7] and also for the Calgary Kickers of the Canadian Soccer League. He is the only member of his family born in Canada; his brother Darren and his mother were both born in Wales, and his other brother Neil and his father were born in England.[7]\n\nAs a youngster in North America, Hargreaves grew up mostly watching and playing sports like basketball, ice hockey and American football. His sporting heroes were basketball legend Michael Jordan and American football player Deion Sanders. He did not begin to play football seriously until the age of 15.[8]\n\nHargreaves tried out for Bayern Munich in October 1996.[9] Hargreaves moved at the age of 16 from Calgary Foothills to Bayern Munich on 1 July 1997.[10] He played in the Under-19 team for two and a half years before spending nine months with the Amateur team. While with the Under-19s the team reached the final of the German Championship in 1998. They lost in the final to Borussia Dortmund, but only after a penalty shoot-out in Dortmund's Stadion Rote Erde.\n\nOn 12 August 2000, Hargreaves played in his first Bundesliga match against Hertha Berlin, making an appearance as a substitute for Carsten Jancker in the 83rd minute.[11][12] His first start came against SpVgg Unterhaching on 16 September 2000.[13] That season the club were Bundesliga champions[14] and also won the UEFA Champions League, with Hargreaves starting the final in central midfield.[15] Hargreaves is one of only two English players to have won a Champions League medal with a non-English club, alongside two-time winner Steve McManaman (who won the Champions League with Real Madrid in 1999\u20132000 and 2001\u201302).\n\nIn the 2001\u201302 season Hargreaves established himself as a first team regular. He made 46 appearances in all, with the club finishing third in the Bundesliga, making the quarter finals of the Champions League and being defeated in the DFB-Pokal by Schalke. The club regained their Bundesliga title in 2002\u201303, along with the DFB-Pokal. On 26 January 2003, Hargreaves scored his first Bundesliga goal in the game against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.\n\n2002\u201303 saw Hargreaves out injured on three occasions. In September he tore a thigh muscle, then in October a calf muscle. Towards the end of the season adductor problems meant he missed a further three weeks. Altogether he made 25 Bundesliga appearances, four in Cup games and three in the Champions League.\n\nThe 2003\u201304 season was Hargreaves' first with Bayern without winning any silverware. After clinching the double the year before, the Bavarian side finished second in the Bundesliga, and were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. Hargreaves made a total of 38 appearances for the club in this season.\n\nIn 2004\u201305 Hargreaves picked up another German championship and DFB-Pokal. He made 27 appearances in the Bundesliga (one goal), played in three Cup games (two goals) and eight Champions League games. In the 2005\u201306 season, he added another Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal title. Hargreaves scored the first goal at the new Allianz Arena in a competitive match on 5 August 2005, against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. In all, he made 15 league appearances (one goal), four cup appearances (two goals) and three Champions League appearances. In October 2005, he extended his contract at Bayern for another four years.\n\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Hargreaves broke his leg, which kept him out of most of Bayern's league campaign that season. He recovered in time to take part in Bayern's victory over Real Madrid in the Champions League, progressing after an aggregate score of 4\u20134 thanks to their two away goals in the 3\u20132 defeat in the first leg at Madrid's Estadio Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. However, Bayern were knocked out in the quarter-final by Milan and finished fourth in the Bundesliga, missing out on Champions League football for the first time since 1996.[16] In total he played 145 top-flight matches in Germany for FC Bayern.[17]\n\nOn 31 May 2007, it was announced that Hargreaves would join Manchester United on 1 July 2007, after almost a year of negotiations between Bayern Munich and United for a fee of around \u00a317\u00a0million.[18] Hargreaves was finally unveiled as a United player on 1 July, having signed a four-year contract with the club. He was then revealed to the press on 9 July, along with fellow newcomer Nani. Hargreaves was given the number 4 shirt at Old Trafford.\n\nHargreaves made his first United appearance in a friendly against Peterborough United on 4 August, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 3\u20131 victory. He made his first Premier League appearance in United's third game of the season, in the derby match away to Manchester City in a 1\u20130 defeat. Hargreaves scored his first league goal for United against Fulham on 1 March, a free kick from just outside the penalty box.[19] He scored his second league goal for the club on 13 April, a free kick winner against Arsenal.[20] In his first season with United they won the Premier League and Champions League titles. In the Champions League final, Hargreaves played all 120 minutes, starting on the right of midfield, and scored United's fourth penalty of the shootout as they defeated Chelsea 6\u20135 on penalties.\n\nThe start of Hargreaves' second season at United was hampered by injury, a recurring patellar tendinitis problem that restricted him to sporadic appearances in 2008\u201309. After trips to specialists in both London and Sweden yielded no results, Hargreaves travelled to Colorado, USA, in November 2008 to visit renowned knee surgeon, Richard Steadman.[21][22] Hargreaves underwent surgery on his right knee on 10 November and received a similar operation on his left knee in January 2009. However, this meant that he would miss the remainder of the 2008\u201309 season,[23] ultimately meaning he would miss out on a second Premier League title as well as League Cup, FIFA Club World Cup and FA Community Shield winner's medals.[citation needed] Hargreaves underwent his rehabilitation programme in the United States, and was due to return to training with United at the Audi Cup in Munich. However, upon assessment, it was decided that he should continue with his rehabilitation in the United States.[24] Hargreaves returned to the club on 23 September 2009, joined by his physiotherapist for a week to aid the transition process and for the club to understand his rehabilitation programme.[25]\n\nIn January 2010, it was speculated that Hargreaves was slated to return in time for United's Champions League first knockout round tie against Milan, despite not being fully match-fit.[26] However, on 4 February, Hargreaves suffered a major setback to hopes of playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup as Sir Alex Ferguson omitted him from the squad for the knockout stage in favour of Belgian defender Ritchie De Laet.[27] It was expected that Hargreaves would make his return from injury in a reserve team match against Manchester City on 11 March,[28] but on the day of the match, Hargreaves pulled out of the game to continue with his training regime.[29] He eventually made his comeback a week later, playing for 45 minutes of United's reserve team match against Burnley on 18 March.[30] On 24 April, Hargreaves was named as an unused substitute for the first-team match against Tottenham Hotspur.[31]\n\nOn 2 May 2010, Hargreaves made his Premier League return in the 93rd minute of United's penultimate game of the season against Sunderland.[32] It was his first Premier League action since a 1\u20131 draw with Chelsea in September 2008, in which time he had missed 113 matches in 20 months.[33] Despite this, Hargreaves missed the beginning of the 2010\u201311 season, having suffered another injury, for which he travelled to the United States to see a specialist. On 24 September, manager Ferguson announced that Hargreaves had returned to training.[34] On 6 November 2010, he made his first start since September 2008 against Wolverhampton Wanderers, however it was short-lived after a hamstring injury forced his withdrawal for B\u00e9b\u00e9 just five minutes into the match, which United went on to win 2\u20131.[35]\n\nOn 22 May 2011, Ferguson confirmed that the club would not offer Hargreaves a new contract.[36] His contract expired at the end of the 2010\u201311 season and he left the club, despite offering to play the 2011\u201312 season for free.[37] Hargreaves later posted videos on YouTube of him exercising, in order to prove his fitness to potential clubs.[38][39] Buoyed by Richard Steadman's optimistic assessment that Hargreaves' knees, a source of injury for a number of years, could withstand the impact of 'jumping from the Eiffel Tower',[40] a number of clubs including Bolton Wanderers Aston Villa,[41] Tottenham Hotspur,[41] Leicester City,[42] West Bromwich Albion,[43] Nottingham Forest[43] Queens Park Rangers,[42][43] Rangers,[42][43] and \"several MLS clubs\",[42][43] were believed to be considering an offer for Hargreaves. In Ferguson's autobiography released in 2013, he called Hargreaves one of his most disappointing signings.[44] In 2020, ESPN ranked his transfer to United as the 27th worst Premier League transfer of all time.[45]\n\nOn 30 August 2011, Hargreaves was pictured supposedly having a medical with Manchester City doctor Phillip Batty ahead of a move to the club.[46] The medical team at City were reportedly impressed by Hargreaves' state of body as well as his state of mind.[citation needed] City had been looking for a replacement for Patrick Vieira who retired the season before and an additional midfielder due to Yaya Tour\u00e9's anticipated absence during January 2012 because of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.[47] They had earmarked Daniele De Rossi, Fernando Gago and Mark van Bommel but when these approaches failed, City turned to Hargreaves[48] \u2013 a player they had been looking at for a few months prior to their initial approach.\n\nOn 31 August 2011, City confirmed that they had signed Hargreaves on a one-year deal.[49] It was expected Hargreaves would join West Bromwich Albion,[50] but the City offer came as a surprise.[51] The move offered Hargreaves an opportunity for Champions League football as the club looked to challenge United for the Premier League. However, he was left out of the Champions League squad. Hargreaves made his City debut against Birmingham City in the League Cup, and opened the scoring in a 2\u20130 victory with a goal in the 17th minute.[52] On 27 April 2012, it was confirmed that he would be released at the end of the season after just four appearances for the club.[53] City were to be victorious in the Premier League, winning their first English title for 44 years, with Hargreaves being involved in the on-pitch celebrations after defeating Queens Park Rangers on the final day. However, after only playing one league match all season, he did not qualify to receive a winner's medal. \n\nFollowing his release, he trained with Queens Park Rangers, but was not offered a contract by the club.[54]\n\nBorn in Canada to a Welsh mother and an English father, Hargreaves was eligible to play international football for England, Wales or Canada.[6] Hargreaves was not selected to play for the Canada U-17 World Cup team, despite being a promising youth player who trialled for Bayern Munich and was about to sign a contract with them.[9] Hargreaves drew the ire of soccer fans in Canada and football fans in Wales for choosing to play for England.[55][56][57] One fansite went to the lengths of demanding that the three Canadian teams in MLS (Montreal Impact, Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps) never sign Hargreaves to play for them,[58] after he was courted by the Vancouver Whitecaps in 2010.[59]\n\nHe represented Wales at the 1998 Milk Cup[60] where Wales finished in third place behind Turkey and Northern Ireland, but finished above Russia.[61] He was set to make his d\u00e9but for the Wales U21 team against the Belarus U21 team in September 2000 but pulled out of the squad after he was approached by England.[6]\n\nOn 31 August 2000, the then England under-21 manager, Howard Wilkinson, called the 19-year-old into his squad for the match against Georgia.[62] The game, played at the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough, ended in a 6\u20131 win for the home team. Further appearances for the under-21s followed in friendlies against Italy and Spain.\n\nHargreaves played his first full international game on 15 August 2001[63] against the Netherlands at White Hart Lane, giving him the distinction of being the only player to appear for England despite having never lived in England. He was also the second player (after Joe Baker) to have appeared for England without having played in English league football and the first to appear for England without having played in England. In only his second cap he came on as a substitute as England famously beat Germany 5\u20131 in the Olympiastadion. Hargreaves was the only player playing outside the Premier League to be selected for England's 2002 FIFA World Cup squad. Hargreaves was injured after just fifteen minutes of England's second group game against Argentina and had to be substituted.\n\nAlthough he had not usually been part of the first-team, he was selected for the England squads at Euro 2004 in Portugal and the 2006 World Cup in Germany despite criticism from sections of the press and public. The generally negative perception of him by English fans had not been helped by his seeming to have an essence of \"German-ness\", exacerbated by his Canadian, Welsh accent and fluency in German.[64] While restricted to three appearances as a substitute at Euro 2004, Hargreaves was in the starting lineup of England's final three matches in 2006. In a tournament in which England were generally regarded as having underachieved, he was, by the end of England's participation, widely considered one of the few successes of the English squad. He was named Man of the match in the quarter final against Portugal, the game in which England were eliminated after a penalty shootout, Hargreaves having been the only successful English penalty taker. In 2006, he won both England Player of the Year, and England Player of the World Cup in official FA polls, the first to win both in the same year.\n\nHargreaves picked up the Man of the match award in England's 4\u20130 win over Greece on 16 August 2006. On 30 January 2007 he was voted England Player of the Year 2006, as voted for by visitors to the Official FA site.[65]\n\nIn June 2007, FIFA announced that Hargreaves and Philipp Lahm would visit South Africa in advance support for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[66]\n\nAfter his transfer to Manchester City in 2011, England coach Fabio Capello hoped that Hargreaves would regain his fitness saying \"I hope he will be really good in the short-term for Manchester City and also for England.\"[67]\n\nHargreaves' career was affected by injuries, the bulk of which formed in 2006, the year he won the award for England's best player at the 2006 World Cup. Hargreaves stated that he believed the bulk of his injury problems to have been in 2007, when he returned from injury after breaking his leg. He felt that his muscle in his leg was weaker than before he sustained his broken leg, and initially Hargreaves ignored the aching and played on.[68]\n\nIt emerged by 2008 that Hargreaves was suffering from a problem with his patella tendon[69] and this was eventually narrowed down to patellar tendinitis.[70] Surgeon Richard Steadman stated that Hargreaves knees were in a worse state than any other he had come across in his 35 years of experience.[71] After numerous operations on both his knees, Steadman said in September 2010 that Hargreaves' problems with his knees were over but Alex Ferguson denied this.[72] In November 2010, Hargreaves made his first start for Manchester United in 777 days, but limped off after six minutes.[73]\n\nIn 2011, Manchester United did not renew his contract due to his injury troubles. Speculation rumbled about Hargreaves retiring due to his injuries[74] but determined to prove himself, he uploaded YouTube videos of himself training to convince potential clubs of his fitness. His determination to carry on despite chronic injury won him admirers.[75][76]\n\nAfter his move to Manchester City, Hargreaves stated that he felt like \"a guinea pig\" during his time on the treatment table at Manchester United. He believed that his prolonged trouble with injuries were due to the revolutionary treatments he was forced to undergo in an effort to solve a problem he felt had been exacerbated by the injections.[77] Sir Alex Ferguson has rejected these claims.[78]\n\nHargreaves appears as a pundit for BT Sport as part of their Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League coverage.[79] He is also a Football Analyst on news channel CNN, and has covered the Euro 2016 competition in France.\n\nBayern Munich\n\nManchester United\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Hargreaves"}, {"id": 61, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/89/1763709/original/patrick-vieira-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Patrick Vieira", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/patrick-vieira/1763709", "desc": "Patrick Vieira (born 23 June 1976) is a French professional football head coach and former player.

Widely considered as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Vieira began his playing career at Cannes, where several standout performances garnered him a move to Serie A club Milan.\n\nIn 1996, he relocated to England to join fellow countryman Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at Arsenal for a fee of \u00a33.5 million. During his nine-year stint in the Premier League, Vieira established himself as a dominating box-to-box midfielder, noted for his aggressive and highly competitive style of play, an attitude that also helped him excel as captain of the club from 2002 until his departure in 2005. He helped Arsenal achieve a sustained period of success during his time at the club, where he lifted four FA Cups and three league titles, including one unbeaten. He was named in the Premier League PFA Team of the Year for six consecutive years from 1999 to 2004.\n\nHe then returned to Italy, playing for Juventus, but quickly departed after the club was relegated as punishment for its part in the Calciopoli scandal. He then signed for Inter Milan, where he consecutively won four league titles, before featuring for Manchester City, where he won another FA Cup before retiring in 2011.\n\nVieira featured at senior level for much of his international career, representing France over a period of 12 years, where he also spent some part as captain. He played in the final in his nation's victorious campaign at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and featured heavily as the team also won UEFA Euro 2000. He also appeared for France at the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004, in the side that finished runners-up in the 2006 World Cup, and at Euro 2008, before retiring from international competition in 2010, having made 107 appearances for the side.\n\nFollowing retirement, Vieira transitioned into coaching, and took charge of the academy at Manchester City in 2013. He departed two years later to become manager of Major League Soccer club New York City FC. He subsequently managed French Ligue 1 club Nice between 2018 and 2020, and Premier League side Crystal Palace between 2021 and 2023.\n\nVieira's family moved from Senegal to Dreux, France,[4] when he was eight, and he did not return to Senegal until 2003.[5] His parents divorced when Vieira was young, and he never met his father again.[6] His French citizenship was conferred on him at birth as his grandfather served in the French Army.[6] His surname Vieira, which is Portuguese, is the maiden name of his mother, who is from Cape Verde.[6]\n\nVieira first played for FC Tours U19 in the early 90s, before moving to Cannes, where he made his debut at the age of 17, in 1993, and captained the team at just 19 years old.[citation needed] In the summer of 1995, he was signed by Italian giants Milan, although he made just two first-team appearances for the club.[7]\n\nOn 10 August 1996, the Daily Mirror reported that Vieira was subject to a move to English club Arsenal, given personal terms with original suitors Ajax were not reached.[8] He joined Arsenal four days later in a \u00a33.5\u00a0million move.[9] The peculiarity of Vieira and fellow Frenchman R\u00e9mi Garde arriving at the club, coupled with manager Bruce Rioch's dismissal before the season had begun, suggested that Arsenal was managed by exterior influence.[9] Vieira later revealed he signed for Arsenal because his compatriot Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was going to be the club's next manager: \"I am delighted to be joining Arsenal at the same time as Mr Wenger becomes their coach. Being able to speak French to him will make life a lot easier for me.\"[10] Wenger was officially in command of managerial affairs at Arsenal by the start of October, but Vieira had already made his mark, coming on as a substitute against Sheffield Wednesday on 16 September 1996; The Times described him as a \"thinking man's Carlton Palmer \u2026 who, at last, gives the Arsenal midfield some variety.\"[11]\n\n\"It's been a while since we've had a midfield player who looks at the front man's run first and then looks at other options. He makes dream passes forward and he's already put me in several times.\"\n\n\u2013Ian Wright, November 1996[12]\n\nVieira made his full debut against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium, three days after.[13] He scored his first goal for the club against Derby County on 8 December 1996 \u2013 a late equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw.[14] His performances for Arsenal in the subsequent months made him a fans\u2019 favourite and was lauded as \"\u2026the playmaker Arsenal have sought since Paul Davis pulled the strings in the 1991 championship-winning team.\"[15] Davis himself noted that in the matches Vieira was suspended during the Christmas period, Arsenal struggled to win.[15] He ended his first season with 38 appearances in total and Arsenal finished in third place, missing out on a spot in the UEFA Champions League via goal difference.[16]\n\nVieira's partnership with international teammate Emmanuel Petit the following season was instrumental in helping Arsenal complete a domestic league and cup double. Vieira scored his first goal of the campaign against Manchester United in a 3\u20132 victory on 9 November 1997.[17] Vieira, however, twisted his knee during the match and was ruled out from playing for a month.[18] He returned for the trip at Wimbledon on 22 December 1997, which was postponed due to floodlight problems.[19] In a game against Coventry City on 17 January 1998, Vieira received his first red card for using \"foul and abusive language\" at referee Stephen Lodge.[20] Vieira was again dismissed a month later, this time in a League Cup semi-final against Chelsea, a decision which Wenger described as \"absolutely ridiculous.\"[21] Towards the finishing straight of the campaign, Vieira helped Arsenal make ground on league leaders Manchester United and his card record had improved, \"\u2026with only one booking in the latter stages of the season\".[22] After a successful World Cup campaign with the national team, Vieira had another productive season at Arsenal in 1998\u201399. Although Arsenal failed to retain the Premier League, Vieira's endeavour was rewarded \u2013 he was named in the PFA Team of the Year alongside Petit.[23]\n\nAgainst West Ham United on 2 October 1999, Vieira was sent off for a second booking, after fouling striker Paolo Di Canio.[24] Moments after, he spat at Neil Ruddock, who walked into him and was dragged off the pitch by officials.[24] Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record \u00a345,000 by The Football Association (FA).[25] The season ended in disappointment for both Vieira and Arsenal, as the team finished 18 points behind champions Manchester United, in second place. Arsenal reached the 2000 UEFA Cup Final, which Vieira played but the team lost the match on penalties against Galatasaray; Vieira's spot kick hit the post.[26]\n\nDisciplinary problems continued to beset Vieira in the 2000\u201301 season. He was sent off on the opening day against Sunderland and for the second time in 72 hours at home to Liverpool.[27] Vieira scored two goals, the following match against Charlton Athletic, in what was his final appearance before a five-match suspension. It was feared that Vieira was prepared to turn his back on English football as he felt victimised \u2013 Wenger, several Arsenal players and fans supported him publicly.[28][29] Vieira himself, after the ban, expressed his desire to remain at Arsenal, but noted he could never alter his style of play: \"...because, basically, I don't want to change. I really enjoy English football and the life in England. I am happy here.\"[30]\n\nAfter a group stage match against Lazio in October 2000, Vieira claimed he was the target of racial abuse from Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107, to which UEFA subsequently launched an investigation into.[31] Mihajlovi\u0107 later admitted he made reference to Vieira's colour, but added that he was provoked. The player was then handed a two-match ban for \"unsporting actions\".[32] Given Arsenal finished behind Manchester United in the league for a third consecutive season, Vieira was reluctant to commit himself to the club and described the season, up until April 2001, as \"average\".[33] Despite how mature his performances had become since Petit left, he criticised Arsenal's decision to sell him and Marc Overmars to Barcelona: \"Of course it was good business but it was a big disappointment for me. If we still had the same team now and put Overmars and Petit in it, we would be even better and stronger. It's not that I miss Petit \u2013 the team needs him.\"[33]\n\nIn May 2001, The Daily Telegraph reported that Manchester United was planning an \"audacious\" attempt to sign Vieira; manager Sir Alex Ferguson, a long-term admirer of the player, was given the green light by his board to make a bid.[34] In the summer period, Vieira disparaged Arsenal's transfer activity and was adamant the club would not finish \"in the top five in the league \u2013 and forget the Champions League,\" saying about his future: \"As far as I'm concerned, the matter is resolved. I am leaving Arsenal and I have made that perfectly clear.\"[35] The club refused to respond to his comments, but vice-chairman David Dein was privately irked at Vieira's agent, Marc Roger, for letting the situation become unsettling.[36] Wenger attributed the saga at the hands of Manchester United: \"[They] made an approach to Patrick without contacting us, and that does not really respect the rules.\"[37] Vieira turned up for pre-season training in July 2001 as normal and was later named the club vice-captain, to ensure he would succeed Tony Adams as captain.[38][39] Success finally came for Vieira in the 2001\u201302 season; Arsenal regained the league and beat Chelsea in the 2002 FA Cup Final to complete a second double.[40]\n\nAdams' retirement in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as \"daunting\", but it was something he looked forward to: \"Taking the responsibility on my shoulders is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well.\"[41] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point.[42] In an interview with L'\u00c9quipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt \"burned out\": \"I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Ars\u00e8ne. He must give me time off to relax.\"[43] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: \"I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains why he was so tired.\"[43]\n\nVieira's performance against Charlton on 14 September 2002 \u2013 incidentally his 200th league appearance for Arsenal \u2013 \"justified Wenger's faith in his captain's fitness\".[44][45] Two months later, he was lauded by The Guardian correspondent David Lacey for his show against Newcastle United \u2013 \"the Arsenal captain dominated the afternoon with a demonstration of tackling, control, awareness and movement that was exceptional even by his standards.\"[46] Vieira sustained a groin injury against Valencia in December 2002, returning on Boxing Day to face West Bromwich Albion.[47] In May 2003, Vieira was fined \u00a32,300 by UEFA, having criticised the organisation for not doing enough on racism \u2013 the player was subject to racist abuse against Valencia.[48] Vieira missed Arsenal's title run-in, which saw Manchester United overtake them in first place, due to sustaining a knee injury.[49] Vieira was also ruled out of the 2003 FA Cup Final which Arsenal won.[50]\n\nIn spite of growing interest to sign Vieira, not least from Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Chelsea in summer 2003, he agreed to stay at Arsenal and signed a deal that ran until 2007.[51] The 2003\u201304 season was a successful one for Arsenal, as they reclaimed the league title and became the first English team in more than a century to go through the entire league season unbeaten. Vieira endured a troubling start to the campaign, as he was sent off against Manchester United in September 2003, banned for one match, and later fined \u00a320,000 \"for improper conduct in failing to leave the field of play following his sending-off\".[52] He went off with a thigh strain during the match against Newcastle United, which commenced a period of being in and out of the side for two months.[53] He scored his first goal of the season against Chelsea on 21 February 2004; Arsenal afterwards opened up a seven-point gap at the top of the league.[54] Two months later, Vieira scored the opening goal away to Tottenham Hotspur, in what ended a 2\u20132 draw \u2013 enough for Arsenal to regain the title.[55] Against Leicester City in the final league match of the campaign, with the score tied at 1\u20131, Dennis Bergkamp set up Vieira with a pass, to which he rounded the goalkeeper and scored. Arsenal ended the campaign as league champions without a single defeat \u2013 a record of 26 wins and 12 draws.[56]\n\nThe re-election of Real Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez in July 2004 prompted him to declare the club's ambition to sign Vieira: \"I must repeat that my policy is to try to sign the best player in the world in every position where we do not already have that. Patrick Vieira is, in my opinion, the best in the world in his position.\"[57] Vieira's advisors met with officials from Real Madrid, before it was speculated a bid of \u00a318\u00a0million had been put on the table.[58][59] Following an ultimatum set by Wenger, who was \"likely\" to make an offer for West Ham midfielder Michael Carrick as his replacement, Vieira chose to stay at Arsenal.[60][61] In a statement, he said: \"I'm staying at the club. I'm proud to be captain of the club and I'm looking forward to achieving my ambitions.\"[61]\n\nVieira scored his first goal of the 2004\u201305 season in a nine-goal North London derby, which Arsenal won 5\u20134 on 13 November 2004.[62] His second goal came in a fortnight at Liverpool, \"lift[ing] a lazy, delicate finish away from Chris Kirkland\" after a one-touch move.[63] Arsenal lost the match late on and Vieira, booked in the match, was suspended for the December clash against league leaders Chelsea; he scored the only goal for the team against Newcastle in the Christmas period.[64] Vieira was involved in a tunnel bust up with Manchester United captain Roy Keane in February 2005 and was confronted about an incident involving Gary Neville.[65][66] Arsenal fell to third as a result of losing 4\u20132 to United, but a 12 league match unbeaten run, culminating in a 7\u20130 home win against Everton, meant they ended the season in second place.[67] In the 2005 FA Cup Final, he scored the winning penalty in a penalty shoot-out after a 0\u20130 draw with Manchester United, which proved to be his final kick of a ball for Arsenal.[68] Vieira returned for the opening match of Emirates Stadium, in a testimonial for Bergkamp on 22 July 2006, as one of the Arsenal legends against Ajax.[69]\n\nIn July 2005, representatives of Juventus met with Arsenal with a view to signing Vieira.[70] The player, according to The Guardian, accepted that Arsenal were \"ready to let him go\" before agreeing in principle to join Juventus.[71] On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth \u00a313.75 million.[72]\n\nVieira was reunited with Fabio Capello, who had signed him at Milan, as a teenager.[72] Capello described him as a \"very important player\", adding \"\u2026his presence is felt not only for his technical value but for his physical quality.\"[72] Capello deployed Vieira in a midfield alongside Brazilian Emerson and Czech Pavel Nedv\u011bd. Vieira made his debut for Juventus in their 1\u20130 win against Chievo on 28 August 2005.[73] On 14 September 2005, he was sent off against Club Brugge, in Juventus' first matchday of the Champions League.[74] Vieira scored his first goal for the club \u2013 a 37th-minute winner against Udinese a week after, which contributed towards Juventus' impressive start to the league season.[75] Having picked up a groin injury through international duty for France, Vieira missed Juventus' Champions League match away to Bayern Munich in October 2005.[76] Despite his performances dipping as the result of a persistent groin injury and a reported training ground bust-up with teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Vieira helped Juventus retain the Scudetto, which was later stripped.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Vieira returned to Highbury on 28 March 2006 to play against Arsenal in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Champions League. During that game, he was the subject of a strong tackle by former club and national teammate Robert Pires. Vieira was left crestfallen as Pires regained possession and Arsenal attacked, scoring the first goal of the tie through Cesc F\u00e0bregas. Pires humorously quipped that it was the first time in 13 years he had got the better of Vieira physically. Vieira also received a yellow card during that leg, which Arsenal won 2\u20130, and was suspended for the return leg on 5 April 2006 which ended 0\u20130 and eliminated Juventus.[77] Arsenal ended up reaching the Champions League final.\n\nJuventus were stripped of their 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 titles after it was revealed they were involved in the Calciopoli scandal.[78] Juventus were relegated to Serie B and deducted 17 points by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for their involvement,[78] prompting many of the club's major stars to move elsewhere. After press speculation linking him to various clubs, including a move back to Arsenal, on 2 August 2006, Vieira officially signed a four-year deal with Inter Milan in a deal to be worth \u20ac9.5 million,[79] less than half of the \u20ac20 million fee Juventus had paid just 12 months prior.[80] Vieira declared he wanted to continue to play at the highest level at the presentation conference, which is his reason to leave Juve.[81]\n\nOn his Inter debut on 26 August, Vieira scored twice as the team won 4\u20133 against A.S. Roma in the 2006 Supercoppa Italiana at the San Siro.[82] He later won the 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, and 2008\u201309 Serie A titles. But due to injury, he failed to become a regular starter. Olivier Dacourt, initially a backup player, became manager Roberto Mancini's first choice player in the 2006\u201307 season. After the club signed Sulley Muntari and Thiago Motta, Vieira became of lesser and lesser importance in the team.\n\nIn response to extensive media speculation regarding a possible return by Vieira to his former club in 2009, Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admitted that he would contemplate re-signing Vieira.[83] The move never happened, however, and Vieira remained at Inter. On 6 January 2010, Vieira unusually played as starter against Chievo, which was his eighth league start of the season.[84] Before the match commenced, Inter had lost Esteban Cambiasso and Muntari due to injury, with Dejan Stankovi\u0107 and Motta suspended.[85] Jos\u00e9 Mourinho stated that Vieira had played his last game at Inter after the match.[86]\n\nOn 8 January 2010, it was confirmed that Vieira was having a medical at Manchester City and he would sign a six-month deal, where he would link up with former Arsenal colleagues Kolo Tour\u00e9 and Sylvinho and former Inter manager Roberto Mancini. The contract also included an option for a 12-month extension.[87] Mancini described Vieira as an excellent midfielder with a winner's mentality and that he would fit into Manchester City's squad very well.[88]\n\nHe made his debut on 6 February in the 2\u20131 defeat away to Hull City, replacing Craig Bellamy after an hour. Three days later, he made his first start against Bolton Wanderers, where he assisted Emmanuel Adebayor through a long ball in the 2\u20130 victory. Later in the month, he was given a three-match retrospective ban for a kick at Stoke City's Glenn Whelan.[89] He scored his first goal for the club against Burnley in a 6\u20131 win on 3 April 2010.[90] On 9 June, Vieira agreed to a one-year extension to his contract, which kept him at Eastlands until the summer of 2011.[91]\n\nOn 22 February 2011, Vieira scored the first two City goals in a 5\u20130 win in the FA Cup Fourth round replay against Notts County, and was awarded Man of the Match honours.[92] He scored in the Premier League on 3 April against Sunderland, a minute after having come on as a substitute for Adam Johnson in the 5\u20130 win.[93] He made an added-time substitute appearance in place of David Silva on 14 May, as Manchester City won the 2011 FA Cup Final with a 1\u20130 win over Stoke at Wembley Stadium.[94] On 14 July, he retired at the age of 35, immediately becoming a development executive at City.[95]\n\nVieira made his debut for France in 1997 against the Netherlands. He was part of the France squad in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He came on as a substitute in the final against Brazil, and set up Arsenal teammate Emmanuel Petit for France's third goal in a 3\u20130 win.[96] He, with the rest of the squad, was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1998.[97]\n\nHe subsequently played as a first choice midfield player in France's successful campaign at UEFA Euro 2000, which they won, beating Italy in the final.[98] He helped France to victory in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, ending the tournament as joint top scorer with two goals, including the winner, a header, in the final against Japan.[99][100] He also played in all three games in the 2002 World Cup, in which France were eliminated in the group stage, failing to score a goal.\n\nVieira was injured and missed France's defeat to Greece, the eventual winners, at Euro 2004.[101] After the tournament in Portugal, he became captain upon Zinedine Zidane's retirement from international football.[102] In August 2005, he returned the armband as Zidane returned to the team.[103]\n\nOn 23 June 2006, his 30th birthday, Vieira took the captain's armband for the match in place of the suspended Zidane, and scored the first goal as France beat Togo 2\u20130 in the group stages of the 2006 World Cup; he also assisted Thierry Henry for the second.[104] This win helped France advance to the knockout stages in second behind Switzerland. In the round of 16, Vieira assisted the equaliser by Franck Rib\u00e9ry and scored the second goal in a 3\u20131 win over Spain.[105] Spain. Vieira started the final, but was substituted injured for Alou Diarra as Italy won 5\u20133 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw.[106]\n\nOn 5 August 2006, Vieira was reappointed captain of the France national team for the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign following Zidane's full retirement.[107] He became the fifth Frenchman to earn 100 caps on 15 November, in a 1\u20130 win over Greece at the Stade de France.[108] He played no part in the group games at Euro 2008 for a struggling France due to a niggling knee injury.[109] His last cap with the national team was on 2 June 2009 in a friendly match against Nigeria, and was not included by coach Raymond Domenech in France's squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.[110]\n\nOn 7 July 2010, Vieira confirmed that he was no longer interested in playing for France and would devote his time to Manchester City.[111] Altogether, he won 107 caps for France, scoring six goals.\n\nRegarded by pundits as one of the best players ever in his position,[112] Vieira was a complete, powerful, tenacious and aggressive footballer, with outstanding physical, athletic and technical attributes, who was also known for his grace on the pitch when in possession of the ball.[113][114][115][116][117] Usually deployed as a defensive, central, or box-to-box midfielder, he was a competent tackler, and a tactically intelligent midfielder, who was known for his ability to anticipate his opponents, and was gifted with good ball skills, distribution and vision, which enabled him to start attacking plays in midfield after winning back possession;[113] he also excelled in the air,[118][119] and was known for his surging forward runs from midfield, which enabled him to contribute to his team's offensive play.[115] These attributes, in addition to his pace, strength, pressing ability and stamina, allowed him to link up the defence with the attack effectively, and made him capable of playing anywhere in midfield.[115][120] In 2007, The Times placed him at number 33 in their list of the 50 hardest footballers in history.[121] In addition to his abilities as a footballer, he also stood out for his leadership throughout his career.[122]\n\nOn 14 July 2011, Vieira announced his retirement from playing and accepted a training and youth development role at Premier League club Manchester City, with the title of \"Football Development Executive\".[123][124] In this role, he forged a strong, close working relationship with City Football Group's Brian Marwood. In May 2013, Vieira was appointed as the manager of the club's new reserve team: the Elite Development Squad (EDS).[125]\n\nIn May 2015, Vieira was interviewed to be the next manager of fellow Premier League club Newcastle United, an opportunity which both parties rejected due to difference of policies.[126]\n\nOn 9 November 2015, Vieira was announced as the new head coach of New York City FC - who share owners with Manchester City, in City Football Group - from 1 January 2016, replacing inaugural head coach Jason Kreis.[127] He was selected for the role by Director of Football Claudio Reyna due to his familiarity with the structure of operations within the group, as well as his tactical knowledge, which was previously utilized by Jason Kreis on his scholar period in Manchester.\n\nVieira's first signing at the club was Jack Harrison, the first pick of the 2016 MLS SuperDraft.[128] He took charge of his first Major League Soccer game on the road versus Chicago Fire on 6 March 2016, in which his squad claimed a 4\u20133 victory. He led New York City to their first ever playoff appearance after finishing second in the Eastern Conference. Despite losing in the conference semi-finals to Toronto, 2016 was considered a successful first season for Vieira by nearly all pundits.[129][130][131][132]\n\nNew York City improved its position in the combined MLS standings in each of his years with the club, improving from 17th in 2015 to 4th in Vieira's first season in 2016 and then to 2nd in 2017.\n\nOn 11 June 2018, Vieira was appointed as the manager of Ligue 1 side Nice.[133] In his first season in charge, he led the club to a seventh-placed finish in the league, one place ahead of the club's position the previous season.[134] Elsewhere in the French domestic circuit, Nice had a disappointing run in the Coupe de France, being eliminated by Toulouse in the round of 64,[135] whereas they were defeated by EA Guingamp in the round of 16 during their Coupe de la Ligue campaign.[136] On 4 December 2020, OGC Nice announced Patrick Vieira was no longer the manager of the club after a run of 5 losses in a row in all competitions and elimination from the group stage of the Europa League.[137]\n\nOn 4 July 2021, Vieira was appointed as manager of Premier League club Crystal Palace on a three-year contract following the departure of their previous manager, Roy Hodgson, who served the club since 2017.[138] He lost 3\u20130 away to Chelsea on his debut on 14 August.[139] In his first season, he earned points away to his two former Premier League teams: a 2\u20132 draw with Arsenal on 18 October,[140] and a 2\u20130 win at Manchester City.[141] He guided the team to a 12th-place league finish in the 2021\u201322 Premier League, and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing to Chelsea.[142]\n\nVieira was involved in an altercation with pitch-invading Everton fans on 19 May 2022 at Goodison Park. Vieira refused to comment on the event, while opposing manager Frank Lampard sympathised with him.[143] Neither Vieira or the fan decided to press charges against the other when they were questioned by Merseyside Police.[144]\n\nVieira was sacked by the club on 17 March 2023, after a twelve-game run without a win, including a three-game span without a single shot on target, left the team three points above the relegation zone.[145] His last match in charge was a 1\u20130 away defeat to rivals Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 March.[146] He was replaced by his predecessor Hodgson.[147]\n\nVieira has been known for implementing a methodical, possession-based football in all his teams. He has shown a tendency to become more defensive when his side are in a tight spot.[148][149] His spell at Crystal Palace saw a shift to a proactive style of gameplay from the reactive counterattack-based gameplay prominent under the management of Roy Hodgson.[150]\n\nVieira and his Trinidadian wife, Cheryl, first met in England while he was playing for Arsenal.[113] They have a daughter.[151] The family were burgled in May 2006 when a gas was pumped into their home near Cannes, but suffered no long-term effects.[151]\n\nIn 2003, Vieira returned to Senegal for the first time since his childhood, to lay the foundation stone of the Diambars football academy in Saly. The academy produced nine of the players in Senegal's squad at the 2012 Olympic football tournament.[5]\n\nVieira features in EA Sports FIFA video game series; he was on the cover of FIFA 2005,[152] and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in FIFA 14.[153]\n\nVieira was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \"Secret Tournament\" commercial (branded \"Scorpion KO\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Lu\u00eds Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\".[154][155]\n\nVieira also worked as a pundit for ITV during their coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[156]\n\nAC Milan\n\nArsenal[168]\n\nInter Milan[168][170]\n\nManchester City[168]\n\nFrance[168]\n\nIndividual\n\nManchester City EDS\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Vieira"}, {"id": 62, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/22/430035/original/alfie-conn-sr-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Alfie Conn, Sr.", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/alfie-conn-sr-/430035", "desc": "Alfred \"Alfie\" Conn (2 October 1926 \u2013 7 January 2009) was a Scottish professional footballer, most commonly remembered as part of the Terrible Trio of the Heart of Midlothian side of the 1950s, along with Willie Bauld and Jimmy Wardhaugh.", "full_desc": "\n\nAlfred \"Alfie\" Conn (2 October 1926 \u2013 7 January 2009) was a Scottish professional footballer, most commonly remembered as part of the Terrible Trio of the Heart of Midlothian side of the 1950s, along with Willie Bauld and Jimmy Wardhaugh.\n\nConn was born in Prestonpans, East Lothian. He joined Hearts from Inveresk Athletic in 1944, making his debut later that year in a 4\u20130 win over Dumbarton in a wartime Southern League match. He established himself in the first team in the 1948\u201349 season, when first combined with Bauld and Wardhaugh. Conn's energetic, tenacious style and powerful shooting complemented the cerebral play of Bauld and the dribbling skills of Wardhaugh. Their first match as a forward trio resulted in a 6\u20131 victory over East Fife. The Terrible Trio continued to score freely in the following 5 seasons, Conn notching 102 goals. Hearts became regular top four finishers yet defensive inconsistency ensured they failed to collect any silverware.\n\nConn eventually won his first medal in the 1954\u201355 season, when Hearts defeated Motherwell 4\u20132 in the 1954 Scottish League Cup Final.[2] The following season, Conn scored as Hearts defeated Celtic 3\u20131 in the 1956 Scottish Cup Final, their first triumph in that competition for 50 years.[2] He ended that 1955-56 season at the peak of his powers aged 29 with a career best 29 goals from 41 games.\n\nTwo weeks after the cup win Conn attained his only Scotland cap on 2 May 1956 at Hampden Park. He put his side ahead after 12 minutes in a 1\u20131 draw with Austria.[2]\n\nConn suffered a serious ankle injury and was to never be the same player again. In the league he made only 10 appearances in 1956-57 and only five when Hearts won the League in 1957\u201358.[2]\n\nHe scored 221 goals in 408 games for Hearts.[3]\n\nConn transferred to Raith Rovers in search of regular first team football. Over two seasons he scored 15 times in the 34 league games he played. He retired from playing in 1960.\n\nConn had a brief spell as manager of both Gala Fairydean and Raith Rovers.[2] Conn watched his son, Alfie Conn Jr., establish a successful footballing career of his own, notably with both Rangers and Celtic.

However, his career progress in the Bundesliga was hampered by a succession of injuries over several seasons.\n\nBorn in Katerini, Papadopoulos was playing for hometown club Svoronos Katerinis in July 2007 when he was invited on trial to train with the RCD Espanyol youth team during pre-season, with a view to giving the player a role in the youth team. Papadopoulos, however, performed well enough for the club's management staff to fast-track him to the reserve team, offering him a contract immediately.[2]\n\nOlympiacos scouts were also aware of the prodigy's talents, however, and the former manager of Olympiacos, George Louvaris, was quick to secure a deal with Papadopoulos' father Nikos, thus bringing him to Piraeus. He immediately featured in several of Olympiacos' pre-season friendlies, three league games and three Greek Cup games.\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season was promising for Papadopoulos. He made his competitive debut for Olympiacos in the Greek Superleague as a substitute during a 3\u20131 win over Atromitos on 2 December 2007,[3] thus becoming the youngest player to ever play in the Greek league at the age of 15 years and 283 days.[4] He also made the substitutes bench in the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid and Lazio, and featured in several Greek Cup games. If Papadopoulos had featured in any Champions League games, he would have broken the record for the youngest player to ever compete in the competition by nearly two years.\n\nIn September 2008, Papadopoulos signed a new contract with Olympiacos, which included a \u00a34.6 million release clause, over three years. On 2 November 2008, he made his first league appearance of the 2008\u201309 season for Olympiacos at home to Ergotelis in a 2\u20130 home win.\n\nOn 23 June 2010, German club Schalke 04 announced that they had signed Papadopoulos on a four-year deal, keeping him until 2014.[5] On 21 August 2010, Papadopoulos made his Bundesliga debut for the club in a 2\u20131 loss against Hamburger SV. On 25 August 2011, in the qualification round of the UEFA Europa League, he scored his first goal for Schalke in a 6\u20131 win over HJK Helsinki.[6] On 1 December, in a group stage game in the Europa League, Papadopoulos scored the opening goal in a 2\u20131 win over Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. On 17 December, Papadopoulos scored his first goal in the Bundesliga in a 5\u20130 win over Werder Bremen and scored the next game on 21 January 2012 in a 3\u20131 win over VfB Stuttgart. Since joining Schalke from Olympiacos, Papadopoulos has played in over 70 matches in all competitions, scoring five goals and has ultimately gathered respect and praise from all over Europe due to his tenacious and skillful defending considering his young age.\n\nAhead of the 2012\u201313 season, Italian club Milan were interested in signing Papadopoulos. After showing interest, Schalke accused Milan of making an illegal approach for Papadopoulos without the club knowing.[7] Also interested were Russian giants Zenit Saint Petersburg, but when their \u00a316 million bid for Papadopoulos was accepted by Schalke, Papadopoulos rejected the move, opting to stay in Germany.[8] In September 2012, Papadopoulos signed a new contract with Schalke that will keep him at the club until 2016.[9] On matchday two of the 2012\u201313 season, Papadopoulos scored his first goal of the season, and third in the Bundesliga, in a 3\u20131 win over FC Augsburg. A virus, however, would later kept him out of play for a number of games, and he would later undergo surgery in an attempt to correct a knee injury he suffered in a 3\u20131 loss away at Hamburger SV in November 2012.\n\nAfter a very difficult year for the defender marred by injury (383 days to be exact), Papadopoulos returned to action in a home game against SC Freiburg in December 2013.[10] Just a few weeks after his return to action, however, Papadopoulos suffered a new shoulder injury and could have been forced to undergo surgery.[11] The news came as another blow, as his recurring knee problems restricted him to just four appearances in the 2013\u201314 season. The injury also forced him to miss the 2014 World Cup with Greece.[12][13]\n\nOn 3 August 2014, Bayer Leverkusen signed Papadopoulos on a season-long loan deal. He told Leverkusen's official website, \"I am very happy that it worked out with the change. Bayer 04 is a club just like Schalke with major international ambitions. Unfortunately I was injured more often in the past season. But now I'm back fit and highly motivated to achieve with Leverkusen both my personal goals as well as the club's.\"[14][15][16]\n\nOn 3 November 2014, Leverkusen announced that Papadopoulos had been ruled out for the remainder of 2014 with a shoulder injury. The centre-back suffered the injury in the final training session ahead of his side's UEFA Champions League away match with Zenit Saint Petersburg; he underwent surgery. \"That's just bitter for Papa,\" Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt told reporters ahead of Leverkusen's trip to Russia.[17] Following his injury, the club announced that Papadopoulos underwent successful surgery on the following Monday in Herne.[18]\n\nOn 8 March 2015, Papadopoulos scored his first Bundesliga goal for Bayer Leverkusen against SC Paderborn.[19] His injury misery continued after, on 25 April 2015, he dislocated his right shoulder in a league match away against 1. FC K\u00f6ln. Leverkusen officials reported that Papadopoulos would return to the training after three months.[20][21]\n\nOn 7 June 2015, Bayer Leverkusen opted to make Papadopoulos' loan from Schalke 04 permanent on a \u20ac6.5 million transfer fee, with the player signing a five-year contract.[22] On 29 September 2015, Papadopoulos scored his first goal in the 2015\u201316 season in the first half of a Champions League encounter against Barcelona: Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu, swung in a corner that hit right underneath Bar\u00e7a goalkeeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen's crossbar; Papadopoulos headed in the rebound from close range.[23] Papadopoulos suffered a lot of injuries during the season facing a tear in a joint capsule that kept him two weeks out of training, as well as a right calf tendon in the 0\u20130 Europa League draw with Villarreal that kept him out of the club until the end of the season.[24]\n\nOn 31 August 2016, Papadopoulos joined RB Leipzig on a \u20ac1.5 million season-long loan deal,[25] linking up once again with Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick, who was his coach when they won the DFB Pokal together with Schalke in 2011. On 21 September 2016, he made his debut with the club as a substitute in a 1\u20131 Bundesliga match against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. On 24 November 2016, Papadopoulos underwent a successful routine surgery to overcome a chronic knee problem. and started a rehabilitation program, with his return to action estimated at three weeks.[26]\n\nOn 13 January 2017, after a frustrating first half of the campaign with RB Leipzig and due to their acquisition of defender Dayot Upamecano from Salzburg during the winter transfer window, Papadopoulos moved to Hamburger SV. The HSV manager Markus Gisdol knew the defender from their time together at Schalke 04.[27] On 21 January 2017, he made his debut with the club as a starter in a 1\u20130 away loss to VfL Wolfsburg. On 3 February 2017 Papadopoulos scored a headed goal from a set piece against Bayer Leverkusen, giving Hamburg a 1\u20130 victory over his parent club. A week later, HSV celebrated back-to-back Bundesliga wins for the sole second time this season as Papadopoulos scored against his last club in a 3\u20130 away win at RB Leipzig.\n\nOn 18 February 2017, in his fourth Bundesliga game with Hamburg, he was substituted in the first half due to a shoulder injury.[28] On 1 March 2017, Papadopoulos returned in the DFB Cup against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. On 18 March 2017, in a 0\u20130 away draw against Eintracht Frankfurt, he reached 100 appearances in the Bundesliga wearing the jersey of four clubs.\n\nOn 21 June 2017, having narrowly avoided relegation the previous season, Hamburger SV signed Papadopoulos on a permanent three-year deal from Bayer Leverkusen on a \u20ac6.5 million transfer fee, with the Dinosaurs to offer another \u20ac3 million in the form of a target bonus, for the next three years.[29][30] On 9 August 2017, despite having been with the club for only six months, he was named vice-captain for the 2017\u201318 season.[31] On 12 December 2017, he scored his first goal for the season in a 2\u20131 home loss against Eintracht Frankfurt.[32]\n\nOn 23 July 2018, according to the  Hamburger Morgenpost, Papadopoulos was suffering from a knee cartilage injury which required immediate surgical treatment. The rehabilitation period was estimated at six months, meaning he would will be able to compete again around Christmas, missing at least the first half of the 2018\u201319 2. Bundesliga season.[33][34] On 30 March 2019, he returned to the squad as a substitute in the bench, in an away 0\u20130 game against VfL Bochum after a difficult recovery process (154 days to be exact) from his cartilage damage and three days later he made his debut with the first team as a starter in a 2\u20130 away win DFB Pokal game against Paderborn.[35]\n\nOn 27 October 2020, the Croatian football club based in Zagreb NK Lokomotiva officially announced the signing of Greek international for an undisclosed fee.[36][37]\n\nOn 18 July 2021, he moved to Saudi Professional League side Al-Fayha, on a free transfer from NK Lokomotiva, for a two-years' contract for an undisclosed fee, increasing the parish of the Greeks in the club after the signing of Panagiotis Tachtsidis.[38] On 28 August 2021, Kyriakos Papadopoulos is looking for the next club of his career, as he is solved his contract with Al-Fayha, after a month of his presence in Saudi Arabia. The 29-year-old defender recorded just one participation, and that was for only 16 minutes.[39]\n\nOn 9 September 2021, Papadopoulos returned to Super League Greece, by signing a season-long contract with Atromitos F.C. for an undisclosed fee.[40]\n\nOn 23 July 2022, Papadopoulos joined FC U Craiova 1948 a Romanian professional football club based in Craiova, Dolj County, which competes in the Liga I on a two years contract for an undisclosed fee.[41] On 21 January 2023, he mutually solved his contarct with the club, as his last official game was in October 2022. [42]\n\nOn 15 February 2023, Papadopoulos returned to Super League Greece, by signing a season-long contract with Lamia FC for an undisclosed fee.[43]\n\nPapadopoulos was called up to the under-19 Greece national team for the Elite round of the 2007 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. He appeared in all three group games against Moldova, Netherlands and Russia, helping Greece finish top and qualify for the finals. Papadopoulos later featured at the heart of the Greek defence in the finals tournament and was partners with teammate Konstantinos Lambropoulos. He was instrumental in keeping a clean sheet against the Czech Republic, as well as strong performances against England and Italy. His performances attracted attention from scouts of elite teams such as Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea.[44]\n\nHe was the youngest player in the tournament by 13 months and the teams were impressed with the defender's maturity while in a competition. Also, he was one of the ten most talented players in Europe as considered by UEFA in their UEFA Under-19 Team of the Tournament.[45]\n\nHe finished an excellent season with Schalke when, on 4 June 2011, the then-Greece head coach, Fernando Santos, called up Papadopoulos for a rookie spot on the team for a match against Malta. Due to an injured Avraam Papadopoulos and Sokratis Papastathopoulos being unable play, he took their place in the squad in the centre of defence next to Vangelis Moras. Papadopoulos had an excellent game that included he scoring the team's second match goal. On 6 September 2011, he scored his second international goal against Latvia in UEFA Euro 2012 qualification.\n\nPapadopoulos was part of the Greece Under-23 squad for the finals of the UEFA Euro 2012. He was a starter in the team's second and third group games and the quarter-final match loss to Germany.\n\nOn 17 April 2015, Papadopoulos was recalled by new Greece manager Sergio Markarian, as part of a selection overhaul, to participate in the nation's European Championship qualifier away at Hungary.[46]\n\nFor the  World Cup 2018 qualifying campaign, Papadopoulos was selected by the German-born coach Michael Skibbe. Against Cyprus, he came on as substitute of Kostas Stafylidis after 71 min. He played the entire third match against Estonia, but was sent off after 79 minutes during the clash against Bosnia-Herzegovina.

He made his debut in 1989 and played initially as a left winger before transitioning to an attacking fullback role for the club. He left Chelsea in 1993 to join the newly promoted Blackburn side being built by wealthy benefactor Jack Walker and was a regular fixture in their 1994\u201395 Premier League winning side. In 1997, he became the most expensive defender in English footballing history when he returned to Chelsea for \u00a35 million, staying there for six seasons before finishing his career with a move to Southampton in 2003. He announced his retirement from football upon Southampton's relegation from the Premier League in 2005.\n\nIn his club playing career, he scored 20 goals from 403 club appearances. He was twice named in the Professional Footballers' Association Team of the Year, in 1995 with Blackburn and in 1998 with Chelsea. As an England international, he made 36 senior appearances from 1994 until 2000, including starting all four England games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, and scoring one international goal, against Brazil.\n\nLe Saux started his career at St. Paul's of Jersey before moving to Chelsea in December 1987 after being spotted playing in a local tournament by manager John Hollins.[2] He made his debut for the club two years later against Portsmouth and had become a regular by the 1990\u201391 season. His first stint at Chelsea ended in controversy, though. Angry at continually being substituted, he snapped when he was subbed again during a match with Southampton and threw his shirt to the ground as he stormed past manager Ian Porterfield. He was sold to Blackburn Rovers in March 1993 for \u00a3700,000.\n\nLe Saux arrived at Blackburn as part of wealthy benefactor Jack Walker and manager Kenny Dalglish's plan to establish the club as one of the country's top sides, and joined an impressive side containing the likes of Alan Shearer and Tim Flowers. Blackburn finished second in Le Saux's first full season, and were crowned Premier League champions a year later, with Le Saux a near ever-present. He missed the second half of the following season due to a broken ankle which also ruled him out of Euro 96, but was still caught up in controversy after fighting with teammate David Batty during a UEFA Champions League tie with Spartak Moscow.[3]\n\nIn August 1997, Le Saux became the most expensive defender in English football when he returned to Chelsea in a \u00a35\u00a0million deal. Always a regular when available, Le Saux's second spell with Chelsea was often interrupted by injury or suspension. He remained there for six seasons, and was an important part of the side which won the League Cup and Cup Winners' Cup in 1998 and the FA Cup in 2000, though he missed the latter two of those finals through injury.\n\nHe was swapped in a part-exchange deal with Southampton for Wayne Bridge in 2003. Le Saux played for another two seasons before announcing his retirement in May 2005 following Southampton's relegation from the Premiership. He scored two goals for Southampton, scoring once in the league against Norwich City[4] and once in the League Cup against Bristol City.[5]\n\nIn June 2012, he was one of several former professional footballers who agreed to join Wembley to play in their FA Cup campaign for the new season. Le Saux and fellow former-internationals Ray Parlour, Martin Keown, Claudio Caniggia and Brian McBride, plus David Seaman (goalkeeping coach) and former England manager Terry Venables (technical advisor), came out of retirement to play for Wembley who were featured in a television documentary as they attempted to help the club play at Wembley Stadium.[6] Wembley were knocked out in a replay by Uxbridge after initially setting up the tie by knocking Langford out in the previous round.[7]\n\nLe Saux was capped 36 times for England. He made his first appearance in a friendly win over Denmark and played at the 1998 World Cup, appearing in every game as England reached the second round. He was injured for Euro 96 and Euro 2000. Le Saux's only international goal came against Brazil on 11 June 1995 in the Umbro Cup, with a powerful shot from outside the penalty area. It came 18th in a poll of the greatest ever England goals.\n\nLe Saux is of English descent through his mother, and has distant Breton descent on his father's side.[8]\n\nLe Saux is heterosexual,[9] and he and his wife, Mariana,[10] have two children.[11] Despite this, rumours that he was homosexual circulated throughout his career after he said that he had spent a summer holiday with one of his Chelsea teammates, Ken Monkou.[12] He attributed this to his lack of enthusiasm for the \"typical\" footballer's lifestyle, his university background, and the fact that he read a left-wing broadsheet newspaper, The Guardian.[13]\n\nThis led to abuse from opposition fans and even players. He was involved in a running series of taunts with Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler while playing for Chelsea against Liverpool on 27 February 1999. During the game, Fowler repeatedly bent over and pointed his backside in Le Saux's direction. Le Saux delayed taking a free-kick to protest about Fowler's behaviour and was booked for time wasting. Fowler claimed in an autobiography that at one point during the match, Le Saux shouted \"But I'm married!\", which was followed up by Fowler's quip \"So was Elton John, mate!\" Le Saux himself said that this never happened, and that Fowler had used 'dramatic licence' to make himself look funny.[14] The referee did not take any action against Fowler. Unseen by the match officials, Le Saux later struck Fowler on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area.[15] Both were later charged with misconduct by the FA.[16] In a later interview with The Times, Le Saux said, \"More than anything in my career, that offended me. What [Fowler] did was wrong and he has never admitted that. He still talks as if it was a bit of a laugh\".[14]\n\nFollowing Thomas Hitzlsperger's disclosure that he was gay in January 2014, Le Saux's article from 2007 resurfaced on social media, causing Fowler to state on Twitter that he had apologised to Le Saux.[17]\n\nIn his 2007 autobiography, Le Saux also accused Chelsea's assistant manager Gwyn Williams of making homophobic comments towards him. \"He would wander up to me before training and say: 'Come on, poof, get your boots on.'\"[18]\n\nLe Saux took an Environmental Studies degree at Kingston University before dropping out to concentrate on his football career. His interest in learning never left him, however, and as a player he was often derided for reading The Guardian and visiting museums in his spare time.[19]\n\nFollowing his retirement he worked as a pundit for the BBC on both their Match of the Day\u00a02 television highlights show, and for their BBC Radio 5 Live station. He currently works as a match analyst and commentator for the U.S.-based NBC Sports Network's television coverage of the Premier League.[20]\n\nIn other television appearances, in 2007 Le Saux was a finalist on the game show Vernon Kay's Gameshow Marathon and in 2009 he competed in series\u00a04 of the talent show Dancing on Ice, being voted off in the first round. Le Saux has reported and presented occasionally for BBC Two's business news programme Working Lunch, while in 2006, he joined ABN AMRO Bank's UK private banking team in the role of Ambassador for their Sports Desk. Le Saux is a trustee of the UK charity Fields in Trust[21]\n\nLe Saux published his autobiography Left Field: A Footballer Apart in September 2007.[12][11]\n\nHe is currently a non-executive director of RCD Mallorca after the club were bought by American investor Robert Sarver and former NBA player Steve Nash in January 2016.[22]\n\nChelsea\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nJersey\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Le_Saux"}, {"id": 66, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/44/860690/original/dion-dublin-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Dion Dublin", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/dion-dublin/860690", "desc": "Dion Dublin (born 22 April 1969) is an English television presenter and former footballer.

However, due to injuries he had to make a number of appearances at centre-half.[citation needed] His prolific goalscoring helped United to successive promotions. During the 1988\u201389 season, Dublin was then loaned out for short spells with Barnet and Wycombe Wanderers.[6][7] The 1989\u201390 season saw Cambridge promoted from the Fourth Division via the play-offs, when Dublin became the first ever scorer in a Wembley play-off final.\n\nIn the 1990\u201391 season, the club were champions of the Third Division, and the club also reached the quarter-final of the FA Cup in both seasons, with Dublin scoring at Arsenal in 1991.[8] In the 1991\u201392 season, he played a big part in helping Cambridge to their highest ever finishing position in the football league, by finishing in fifth place in the last season of the old Second Division, but when Cambridge failed to win promotion to the top flight via the play-offs Dublin was put up for sale. He has since spoken many times of his affection for Cambridge United.\n\nHaving seen Dublin in a cup tie, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson signed him for \u00a31\u00a0million on 7 August 1992, fighting off competition from Chelsea and Everton.[9] Dublin was something of a surprise purchase for United,[10] after Ferguson had tried to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton but lost out to Blackburn Rovers.[11]\n\nHe scored in United's fourth Premier League game of the 1992\u201393 season, a last minute winner in United's first Premier league victory \u2013 1\u20130 against Southampton at The Dell.[12] However, on 2 September, he suffered a broken leg against Crystal Palace in a 1\u20130 win at Old Trafford, after a tackle by Eric Young,[13] and was out of action for six months.[14] By the time he had recovered, however, United had signed Eric Cantona and the Frenchman was firmly established as first choice strike partner to Mark Hughes. United won the league that season for the first time since 1967, but Dublin failed to make the 10 Premier League appearances required to automatically gain a title winner's medal. However, he was given a medal as a result of special dispensation from the Premier League.\n\nIn the 1993\u201394 season, Dublin regained his fitness, but his first team chances were restricted by the successful partnership of Cantona and Hughes. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed a deal with Everton manager Howard Kendall, that would have seen Dublin moving to Goodison Park, but a member of Everton's board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not worth the money Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through \u2013 this dispute sparked Kendall's resignation as manager. Dublin would remain a United player for another nine months, but never managed to claim a regular place in the first team.[15]\n\nHe managed five league appearances that season, scoring once in a 3\u20132 home win over Oldham Athletic in early April, his goal helping secure a vital victory in the title run-in during a spell when United started to drop points and Blackburn Rovers were closing in on them.[16] He also managed a further goal in the Football League Cup second round first leg, as United were beaten 2\u20131 by Stoke City at the Victoria Ground. The goal against Oldham was the only competitive goal that Dublin scored for United at Old Trafford. He was left out of the FA Cup winning team against Chelsea and failed to make enough appearances to merit another Premier League title winners medal. In September 1994, he was sold to Coventry City for \u00a32\u00a0million \u2013 a record signing for Coventry City at the time \u2013 and also one of the largest fees received by Manchester United.[17][18]\n\nIn four years with Coventry, Dublin established himself as one of the Premier League's top strikers and during the 1997\u201398 season won the first of his four full England caps. That season, he equalled the Coventry City record for most goals in a top division season, with 23 goals in all competitions.\n\nFollowing Phil Neal's departure in 1995, the arrival of Ron Atkinson and Gordon Strachan would see Dublin fit into an attacking team in the typical Atkinson mould. It included the likes of Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby to add to the already attack minded Peter Ndlovu. The addition of Gary McAllister, following UEFA Euro 1996, should have provided mid-table stability, but the team's defensive frailties often undermined Dublin's scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premier League history in May 1997. Despite having won away to Liverpool (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and at home to Chelsea at the start of April, the Sky Blues could only manage two points from their following three games. City went into the final day second from bottom of the table, needing not only to beat Tottenham away from home, but also for results elsewhere in the league to go their way for them to escape relegation. They achieved the most unlikely of escapes; first-half goals from Dublin and Paul Williams gave Coventry a 2\u20131 win at White Hart Lane, while Sunderland lost at Wimbledon and Middlesbrough could only manage a draw at Leeds.[19] Coventry finished the season in 17th place, one point outside the relegation zone.[20]\n\nThe following season, the Sky Blues improved at home and enjoyed a season of mid-table security. Dublin formed an impressive partnership with Darren Huckerby which not only produced some memorable goals, but also propelled the Sky Blues to the FA Cup Sixth Round against Sheffield United; a game they narrowly lost in a penalty shoot-out.\nOn 8 November 1997, Dublin scored one of the most bizarre goals in Premier League history. Early in the match against Newcastle, goalkeeper Shay Given collected a cross from the right and placed the ball in front of him. The ball was still in play, and Dublin, who had attempted to meet the cross and was now behind Given, reappeared and calmly slotted the ball into the empty goal. This led to the joke: \"Shay Given, the only Irishman who doesn't know where Dublin is.\" The match ended 2-2, with Dublin also scoring City's second goal in the second half.[21]\nThe 1997\u201398 season also saw Dublin share elite status as the Premier League's top scorer with Blackburn's Chris Sutton and Liverpool's Michael Owen \u2013 each Englishman scoring 18 league goals. During this season, Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson tabled a bid which Dublin rejected. He remained at Highfield Road and contributed to Coventry's best finish to date in the Premiership (11th).\n\nDublin was controversially excluded from the England 1998 FIFA World Cup squad, despite being the Premier League's joint top-scorer in the 1997\u201398 season. However, his exploits at club level were still attracting significant attention, and in the autumn of 1998, he chose to move to Aston Villa for \u00a35.75\u00a0million.[22] In his first four games for the club, he would score seven goals, including a memorable hat-trick against Southampton in only his second game for Villa. As a result, he is one of only six players to score in the first four consecutive games for a Premier League club.[23]\n\nIn December 1999, while playing for Aston Villa against Sheffield Wednesday, he sustained a life-threatening broken neck,[24] as a result of which he permanently has a titanium plate holding three neck vertebrae together. Just days before suffering this injury, it was reported in the News of the World that Dublin would soon be sold by Aston Villa for a fee of around \u00a36\u00a0million as the club looked to finance a fall in its share value as a result of manager John Gregory's heavy expenditure on players.\n\nHowever, the injury did not end Dublin's career and he was back in action three months later.[25]\n\nIn April 2000, a week after returning to the team, he helped Aston Villa reach their first FA Cup final in 43 years, which they lost 1\u20130 against Chelsea,[26] scoring a penalty in the semi-final shoot-out against Bolton Wanderers.[27]\n\nFaced with competition for a first-team place by new signings Juan Pablo \u00c1ngel and Peter Crouch, Dublin spent several weeks on loan at First Division Millwall towards the end of the 2001-02 season. In his time there, he scored two goals, against Stockport County[28] and Grimsby Town[29] in five league matches to help them into the play-offs, where despite Dublin's goal in the first leg of the semi-final,[30] against Villa's arch rivals Birmingham City,[31] Millwall lost 2\u20131 on aggregate.[32]\nFollowing Millwall's elimination from the play-offs, Dublin returned to Aston Villa in time for their final game of the season, against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He replaced Darius Vassell in the 84th minute and scored Villa's third goal in a 3-1 win.[33]\n\nDublin once again found himself a first-choice striker at the start of the 2002-03 season, partnering Darius Vassell up front. In March 2003, he was sent off at Villa Park for a headbutt on Robbie Savage in the Birmingham derby match, which ended 2\u20130 to Birmingham City.[34]\n\nWhen his contract expired in the summer of 2004, he was given a free transfer. He was signed by Leicester City, who had been relegated from the Premier League to the Championship.[35] In his first season with the club, he scored only four goals in 38 competitive matches. During the 2005\u201306 season, Dublin lost his place as the team's main striker, but continued to appear as a defender. His contract at Leicester City was terminated by mutual consent on 30 January 2006.\n\nHe was snapped up quickly by then Celtic manager Gordon Strachan, to cover for the loss of Chris Sutton, on a contract until the end of the season.[36] At Celtic, Dublin achieved double success, with Scottish League Cup and Scottish Premier League winner's medals. On 19 March 2006, Dublin came on as a substitute and scored the final goal as Celtic defeated Dunfermline 3\u20130 to win the Scottish League Cup final,[37] and also played enough matches with Celtic to merit a title medal. In the league, he made three league starts and eight substitute appearances for Celtic, scoring once against Kilmarnock on 9 April 2006 in a 4\u20131 win at Rugby Park.[38] Despite one or two decent performances for the Parkhead outfit, Dublin was released by Strachan in May 2006.\n\nOn 20 September 2006, Norwich City announced that Dublin had joined them until the end of the 2006\u201307 season. It marked a return, almost 20 years after leaving, for Dublin to the club where he began his career. He made his debut on 23 September 2006 when he came on as substitute against Plymouth Argyle. He scored his first competitive goal in Norwich City colours in a 3\u20133 draw against Queens Park Rangers on 14 October 2006 at Loftus Road. Steve Wilson cited Dublin as the main inspiration behind Norwich's 4\u20131 FA Cup 3rd Round win at Tamworth, in which the striker scored two goals and set up numerous chances for other teammates.\n\nDublin was an important figure in Norwich securing safety from relegation to League One and the supporters recognised his contribution by voting him in second place in the Norwich City player of the year award, and on 23 May 2007 he ended speculation about his future by signing a new one-year contract at Norwich, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2007\u201308 season. On 2 September 2007, while working as a pundit on a match between Aston Villa and Chelsea, Dublin said that this season would be his last as a professional footballer, citing the fact that his \"bones have started to talk to him\" as the reason, meaning that he did not think his body can handle another season.[citation needed]\n\n\"It was incredible at Hillsborough. If you think of the stadia I could've retired at, away from Norwich of course, with the history and the feeling, then Sheffield Wednesday was the perfect place\".\n\nDion Dublin[39]\n\nIn the spring of 2008, Dublin was approached by Jimmy Quinn, then manager of Cambridge United, about joining his old club for the 2008\u201309 season. However, the player would not change his mind about retiring. He was voted the club's Player of the Year and awarded the Barry Butler trophy on 26 April 2008 in his final season as a footballer, at his penultimate game, and on his final appearance at Carrow Road. Dublin played his final game on 4 May 2008, featuring in Norwich's 4\u20131 loss to Sheffield Wednesday in front of 36,208 fans at Hillsborough \u2013 the highest Championship attendance that season.[39] When he was taken off in the 66th minute, Dublin received a standing ovation from both sets of supporters and players, and referee Mark Clattenburg.\n\nDublin earned his first cap for England on 11 February 1998, playing the whole 90 minutes in the 2\u20130 friendly defeat to Chile at Wembley Stadium.[40] In the run-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Dublin played in the King Hassan II International Cup Tournament in May, starting in the 1\u20130 win against Morocco,[41] and coming off the bench in 0\u20130 draw with Belgium, a game England lost on penalties.[42] Despite showing good form and versatility throughout the season, including finishing joint top scorer in the Premier League with 18 goals, Glenn Hoddle included Les Ferdinand ahead of Dublin in his 22-man squad for the tournament in France.[43] On 18 November, he started in the 2\u20130 friendly win against the Czech Republic at Wembley Stadium.[44] This turned out to be Dublin's last cap for his country.[45] He won four caps for England but did not score any goals.[45]\n\nSince retiring from football, Dublin has worked in the media as a pundit for Sky Sports. As well as appearing on Ford Super Sunday with Richard Keys, Dublin has commentated on a number of games including the UEFA Champions League games with Martin Tyler. He has also been a member of the panel on BBC Radio 5 Live's Fighting Talk. He has also co-presented 606 on BBC Radio 5 Live, Match of the Day 2 and was also a regular on BBC One's Late Kick Off in the East region. He joined Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts on Homes Under the Hammer in 2015.[46]\n\nAlso for the BBC, he has appeared as a regular pundit for BBC Sport namely on Football Focus, Match of the Day or Final Score. He also occasionally provides co-commentary on live televised FA Cup games.\n\nIn August 2021 it was announced that Dublin would be a competitor on BBC's Celebrity MasterChef.[47] He reached the final.[48]\n\nAway from football, during his spell with Norwich,[49] he invented a percussion instrument called The Dube,[50] a form of caj\u00f3n. In 2011, he accompanied Ocean Colour Scene during a gig at the University of East Anglia.[49][51]\n\nIn July 2021, Dublin was appointed as a club director at former club Cambridge United.[52][53]\n\nCambridge United\n\nManchester United\n\nAston Villa\n\nCeltic\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_Dublin"}, {"id": 67, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/60/1185586/original/hristo-stoichkov-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Hristo Stoichkov", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/hristo-stoichkov/1185586", "desc": "Hristo Stoichkov (Bulgarian: \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432, pronounced [\u02c8xristo sto\u02c8it\u0283kof]; born 8 February 1966) is a Bulgarian former footballer who is currently a football commentator for Univision Deportes. A prolific forward, he is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and is widely considered the greatest Bulgarian footballer of all time.

A prolific forward, he is regarded as one of the best players of his generation[2] and is regarded as the greatest Bulgarian footballer of all time. He was runner-up for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1992 and 1994, and received the Ballon d'Or in 1994. In 2004, Stoichkov was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[3]\n\nAt club level, Stoichkov spent six years at CSKA Sofia and became the top goalscorer in Europe in 1990, receiving the European Golden Shoe. In 1990, he joined Barcelona where he earned the Spanish nickname \"El Pistolero\" (\"The Gunslinger\"), and was part of Johan Cruyff's \"Dream Team\" that won four consecutive La Liga titles and the 1992 European Cup. During his time at the club, he formed a prolific strike partnership with Rom\u00e1rio. Cruyff was largely instrumental in bringing him to Barcelona where he quickly developed into one of the most prolific forwards in the world.\n\nStoichkov was a member of the Bulgaria national team that finished fourth at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, of which he was the top scorer with six goals and received the World Cup Golden Boot. He was ranked the third-best player at the World Cup, after Rom\u00e1rio and Roberto Baggio, and received the World Cup Bronze Ball. Apart from his footballing talent, he was notable for his on-pitch temper.[4] In his playing career, he was also nicknamed The Dagger (\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0430).[5]\n\nStoichkov was born in the city of Plovdiv.\n\nStoichkov began his football career playing for hometown club Maritsa Plovdiv at age 11. In 1982, he moved to Hebros Harmanli, scoring 14 goals in the third level of Bulgarian football.\n\nIn early 1985, Stoichkov joined CSKA Sofia. At the beginning of his five-year stay at CSKA, Stoichkov (who later became famous for his short temper) became involved in a fight during the 1985 Bulgarian Cup Final, which resulted in an original lifelong ban, later reduced to an year suspension.[6] He made his comeback for CSKA on 30 April 1986, in a 3\u20131 away win over Sliven in a game of the Cup of the Soviet Army. On 21 May, Stoichkov opened the scoring in the final of tournament against Lokomotiv Sofia, which CSKA won 2\u20130.[7]\n\nHe continued his progress during 1986\u201387, becoming a regular in the left side of CSKA's attack. Stoichkov collected his first A Group title winner's medal at the end of the season. He scored 6 league goals that season.\n\nStoichkov managed to win the European Golden Boot with CSKA by scoring 38 goals in 30 matches during the 1989\u201390 A Group season.[4]\n\nAfter five years with CSKA, Stoichkov transferred to Barcelona. In his first season with the club, Stoichkov was suspended for two months for stomping on a referee's foot,[8] but he still scored 14 league goals and 6 more in the European Cup Winners' Cup. He became part of manager Johan Cruyff's \"Dream Team\" and helped Barcelona to one of the most successful eras of the club, winning La Liga four years in a row between 1991 and 1994 and the European Cup after defeating Sampdoria in 1992.[9]  During his stay in Barcelona, he became an idol for the club's fans, and played in tandem with Rom\u00e1rio in attack. Stoichkov was also known for making sure Romario attended training sessions on time, as the latter often indulged in late-night fiestas.[10] Stoichkov was twice named runner up for the FIFA World Player of the Year, in 1992 and 1994, and he won the 1994 Ballon d'Or after leading his national team to the 1994 World Cup semi-finals.[4]\n\nStoichkov then had a short spell in Italy with Parma scoring a total of seven goals and soon returned to FC Barcelona where he played until early '98. He also had a second stint with CSKA Sofia in the spring of 1998.[11] In April 1998 he signed a two-match contract for Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr helping them win the Asian Cup Winners' Cup. In the semi-final against Kopetdag, he earned a penalty and assisted the winning goal and in the final against Suwon Bluewings, he scored the only goal in the 12th minute. For those two games Hristo received $200.000. He subsequently went in Japan to play with Kashiwa Reysol, before finishing his career in the United States with the Chicago Fire and D.C. United, winning the U.S. Open Cup (and scoring the first goal in the final) with the former.[4]\n\nStoichkov debuted for the Bulgaria national team in a UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying match against Belgium on 23 September 1987. He scored his first international goal in his fourth appearance, a 3\u20132 friendly defeat of Qatar in Doha.[12]\n\nDuring qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Stoichkov scored five goals to help Bulgaria qualify for its first major tournament since the 1986 World Cup. At the tournament finals, Stoichkov was awarded the World Cup Golden Boot as the joint top goal scorer of the tournament (with Oleg Salenko), with six goals, as well as earning the Bronze Ball award. He led Bulgaria past Germany in the quarter-finals 2\u20131, a shock result as Germany were the then-defending champions. In the semi-finals, Bulgaria lost 2\u20131 to Italy. They subsequently lost the third place play-off to Sweden, 4\u20130.[4]\n\nBulgaria finished second in the qualifying group for Euro 1996 behind Germany. Stoichkov scored ten goals for his team during the qualifiers, as Bulgaria qualified as one of the best six runners-up. In the first match against Germany in Sofia, Bulgaria were 2\u20130 down at half-time. Stoichkov equalized with two goals from penalties and Emil Kostadinov also scored for a 3\u20132 win. Bulgaria lost the second match in Germany 3\u20131. During the finals, Bulgaria lost 3\u20131 in the decisive group match against a strong France side; in the other match, Spain won 2\u20131 against Romania and so the Bulgarians went out. In that tournament, Stoichkov scored three goals in three matches.[4]\n\nHe was also part of the squad that was eliminated in the first round of the 1998 World Cup. Bulgaria was not nearly as strong as in previous years, earning only one point in a 0\u20130 draw against Paraguay and scoring only one goal through Kostadinov in a 6\u20131 defeat by Spain. Stoichkov retired from internationals in 1999 with 37 goals in 83 appearances.[4] His last game was during the Euro 2000 Qualification against England which ended 1-1 and Stoichkov assisted Georgi Markov for the equalizer goal from free kick goal. In the same game he was substituted with Martin Petrov for whom it was debut with Bulgarian shirt. Ironically, both are Bulgaria's only goalscorers in a UEFA Euro Tournament, Stoichkov was the only Goalscorer in 1996 with 3 Goals while Petrov in 2004 in the 2\u20131 loss against Italy. Bulgaria failed to Qualify for the Euro 2000 in Belgium and the Netherlands after the game, as they needed a win to have chances to qualify.\n\nHe later served as coach of the Bulgaria national team from 2004 to April 2007.[4]\n\n\"That season [1993\u20131994] Rom\u00e1rio and Stoichkov were a force of nature, blowing everyone and everything to bits.\"\n\n\u2014 Football writer Sid Lowe on the strike partnership at Barcelona.[10]\n\nStoichkov had explosive pace, and was a creative, tenacious and prolific left-footed forward who was primarily used as a striker, but was also capable of playing in a creative role, as an attacking midfielder, due to his ability to provide assists for teammates.[13][14] He was also deployed as a supporting striker throughout his career, forming a strike partnership with Rom\u00e1rio at Barcelona, and occasionally he played as a right winger during his time at the club, although he was also capable of playing on the left or through the middle.[15][16] In his early years he also used to play as a left full-back. A powerful, physically strong and technically gifted player, Stoichkov was known for his explosive acceleration, and his dribbling ability at speed, as well as for his tendency to take unpredictable, powerful shots on goal.[17][18] The top goalscorer at the 1994 World Cup, he was also notable at taking free-kicks and penalties,[19] as well as being a very good crosser and passer of the ball.[20] Manager Dimitar Dimitrov described Stoichkov as \"one of the greatest players of all time\" in 2006, and as a player who had \"a winning mentality.\"[21]\n\nStoichkov was criticised for his work-rate at times,[22] and he also gained infamy because of his aggressive temper on the pitch; he could often be seen arguing with the referee, or with his opponents.[23] At Euro 1996, after Bulgaria's final group stage match against France, he was accused by French defender Marcel Desailly of making insulting remarks about Desailly's race.[24]\n\nIn 2006, he was sued by a former American University college student whose leg he broke with a violent tackle while playing in a friendly match for D.C. United in 2003. The case was settled out of court in 2007 with undisclosed financial terms.[25] The student's coach called Stoichkov's challenge \"criminal\". Ray Hudson, who coached D.C. United for whom Stoichkov played at the time, called it a \"rash tackle\". Following an investigation by Major League Soccer (MLS), Stoichkov was suspended two games and fined US$2,000.[26]\n\nStoichkov features in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was included in the FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends.[27][28][29]\n\nIn 2018 he published his authorized biography \"Hristo Stoichkov. The Story\".[30] The official unveiling of the autobiography in November was attended by many footballers, other sportspeople, former Bulgarian presidents Petar Stoyanov, Georgi Parvanov and Rosen Plevneliev as well as former Spanish referee Idefonso Ur\u00edzar Azpitarte, who had sent off Stoichkov during the first match of the 1990 Spanish Super Cup final and was given the opportunity to symbolically stomp on Stoichkov's foot.[31]\n\nIn the 2003\u201304 season, Stoichkov started a managing career, serving as a forwards coach at Barcelona. After Bulgarian national team manager Plamen Markov resigned in the wake of the team's first-round exit from Euro 2004, the Bulgarian Football Union named him as the new national team manager on 15 July.\n\nStoichkov's managing career got off to a poor start, with him failing to lead Bulgaria to qualification for the 2006 World Cup. He brought his bad temper from his career as a player to the bench. A couple of proven players quit the team due to personal differences with Stoichkov. The most notable scandal was on 5 September 2005, in a game against Sweden, where he was sent-off for insulting the referee.\n\nThe biggest blow to Stoichkov as a manager of the national team of Bulgaria came on 12 October 2006, when Stiliyan Petrov, the captain of the team, announced he would not play for Bulgaria so long as Stoichkov was manager.[32] Petrov was the third player and the second captain in two years to leave the team because of differences with Stoichkov. On 17 March 2007, however, Petrov announced that he had had a private conversation with Stoichkov, in which they were able to work their differences out. As a result, Petrov would return to the team.[33]\n\nOn 10 April 2007, the Bulgarian Football Union announced they had accepted the resignation of Stoichkov from his post with the national team. That was as a result of the poor performance of the team at the ongoing Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, followed by widely spread criticism and debate over the qualities of the manager. The specific game, which led to increased pressure on Stoichkov, was the 0\u20130 home draw with Albania (despite the fact that the Bulgarians generally controlled the game and hit the post twice). He had a short disappointing stint as manager at Celta Vigo, for which he was sacked following the team's slump that took them to the lower reaches of the Spanish Second Division. On 8 October 2007, he was replaced by ex-Real Madrid manager Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro. On 12 March 2009, Stoichkov visited the Manchester City training ground after requesting a visit.[34]\n\nOn 29 June 2009, Stoichkov moved to Mamelodi Sundowns, where he replaced Henri Michel.[35] On 16 March 2010, he quit Mamelodi Sundowns, with the former South Africa national team manager Trott Moloto named caretaker until a full-time replacement is found.[36]\n\nIn 2011, the Vietnam Football Federation invited Stoichkov to become the head manager of Vietnam national team;[37] however, he declined the position. In the 2011\u201312 season, he worked as an advisor at Russian club Rostov.[38]\n\nIn January 2012, Stoichkov was appointed manager of Bulgarian side Litex Lovech, replacing Lyuboslav Penev, who left to become manager of the Bulgaria national team. In May 2013, Stoichkov was recognized as the A PFG manager of the season following a vote by the professional footballers in the Bulgarian league.[39] In June 2013, he was named the manager of Bulgarian powerhouse \u2013 and former club \u2013 CSKA Sofia,[40] but quit one month later after he lost faith in the troubled club.\n\nCSKA Sofia[4]\n\nBarcelona[4]\n\nParma\n\nAl-Nassr\n\nKashiwa Reysol\n\nChicago Fire\n\nBulgaria[4]\n\nIndividual\n\nRecords\n\nMamelodi Sundowns\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hristo_Stoichkov"}, {"id": 68, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/476/9512653/original/william-bromley-davenport-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "William Bromley-Davenport", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/william-bromley-davenport/9512653", "desc": "Brigadier-General Sir William Bromley-Davenport,  (21 January 1862 \u2013 6 February 1949) was a British soldier, footballer and Conservative politician.

He has previously managed AFC Bournemouth, West Ham United, Portsmouth, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, Queens Park Rangers and Birmingham City. In his second spell at Portsmouth, he managed the side that won the 2008 FA Cup.[4] At the conclusion of the 2009\u201310 season, he guided Tottenham into the UEFA Champions League.[5] Redknapp announced his retirement from football management in 2017.[6]\n\nHis son, Jamie Redknapp, played under him at Bournemouth and Southampton.[7] He is also uncle to Frank Lampard, who played under him at West Ham United.[8]\n\nRedknapp was born in Poplar, London,[9] the only child of Henry Joseph William Redknapp (1922\u20131996) and Violet May Brown (1924\u20132001).[10]\n\nAt age 11, while Redknapp was playing for East London Schools football, he was spotted by Dickie Walker, a Tottenham Hotspur scout. From there, Redknapp grew in the Tottenham youth ranks playing at Cheshunt, meeting the likes of Bill Nicholson, Dave Mackay and Danny Blanchflower. At age 15, Redknapp moved to West Ham United and played alongside Bobby Moore.[11] In a 2008 interview, Redknapp stated as part of a tribute to Tom Finney, \"I was a big Arsenal fan as a kid and I remember seeing him play against Tommy Docherty one night.\"[12]\n\n\nAfter being appointed Tottenham manager later in 2008, Redknapp stressed his Tottenham connections as well, stating:\nI am a big follower of the history of the game and Tottenham have been a great club over the years. I followed Tottenham, I trained there as an 11-year-old, 12-year-old so I know the history of the club. It is a big, big club.[13]\nDuring his playing career, Redknapp played as a midfielder. He began his career with Tottenham Hotspur, playing for the youth team until he was 15 years old, when he moved to West Ham United. He first broke into the first team at West Ham in the 1965\u201366 season, making seven appearances and scoring one goal. He made his debut for West Ham in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Sunderland on 23 August 1965.[14] His first goal came in a 4\u20131 away win over Tottenham on 8 April 1966.[14]\n\nRedknapp made his first start of the 1966\u201367 season, and scored his second goal for the club, on 3 December 1966 in a 3\u20130 win over West Bromwich Albion.[14] Redknapp made 12 League appearances scoring once during his second season.[14] During the 1967\u201368 season, he made 28 League appearances and scored twice, the first in a 4\u20132 home win over Burnley on 21 August 1967 and the second in a 5\u20131 away win over Sunderland on 6 September 1967.[14]\n\nDuring the 1968\u201369 season, Redknapp made 42 appearances and scored three times, with 36 appearances coming in the league (along with two goals), three in the FA Cup appearances and three in the League Cup (along with one goal). His first league goal of the season came in a 4\u20130 win over West Brom on 31 August 1968, while the next came in a match in the League Cup against Bolton Wanderers, which West Ham won 4\u20130. Redknapp received a red card in a 2\u20130 away defeat at Leeds United on 12 October 1968.[14] He had been booked for fouling Billy Bremner and was dismissed by the referee for dissent.[15] His third goal of the season came in a 4\u20133 win over Queens Park Rangers on 2 November 1968.[14]\n\nRedknapp made his first appearance of the 1969\u201370 season on 9 August 1969 in a 1\u20130 home win over Newcastle United, while his first goal of the season came in a 3\u20130 home win over Sheffield Wednesday on 2 September 1969. Redknapp made 26 total appearances and scored one goal; 23 of his appearances came in the league.[14]\n\nDuring the 1970\u201371 season, Redknapp made 21 league appearances with one more coming in the League Cup.[14] He then made a further 35 appearances during the 1971\u201372 season with 22 of them coming in the league. This would be his last season at the club before he moved to AFC Bournemouth for the 1972\u201373 season. He made 175 total appearances in both league and cup action for West Ham, scoring eight times over seven seasons.[14]\n\nRedknapp joined Division 3 AFC Bournemouth in 1972 from West Ham. He spent four seasons with the south coast side between 1972 and 1976.\n\nIn the 1972\u201373 season, Redknapp made 37 appearances with 34 of them coming in the league scoring once in the league and Bournemouth finished seventh in the league. He made a further 46 appearances scoring five times during the 1973\u201374 season with 39 appearances in the league.\n\nRedknapp made 19 (all league) appearances during the 1974\u201375 season as Bournemouth were relegated to the Fourth Division. In 1975\u201376, he only managed nine appearances. At the end of the 1975\u201376 season, he moved to then Fourth Division side Brentford, where he made one appearance during the 1976\u201377 season.\n\nIn 1976, Redknapp joined North American Soccer League (NASL) club Seattle Sounders as a player-coach. He made 15 appearances during the 1976 season as they reached the playoffs after finishing second in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, before losing to the Minnesota Kicks in the Division Championship.[2] Before returning to Seattle, he appeared briefly for AP Leamington in the Southern League Premier Division.[16][3] Redknapp then made five appearances during the 1977 season as they finished third in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, before losing out in Soccer Bowl '77 to Pel\u00e9's New York Cosmos, 2\u20131.\n\nRedknapp went on to make three appearances in the 1978 season and just the one in the 1979 season, before joining up with old teammate and 1966 World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore.\n\nIn 1980 he was contracted to play with ASL expansion team the Phoenix Fire, but the team folded in pre-season.[17]\n\nRedknapp represented England at youth level when he was 17. He was in the side that won the 1964 UEFA European Under-18 Championship after defeating Spain 4\u20130 in the final.[18]\n\nRedknapp began his management career as player-assistant manager of NASL club Seattle Sounders from 1976 to 1979 under Jimmy Gabriel. During his time with Seattle, Redknapp made 24 appearances, helping the side to second place in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, in his first season as player-coach, and then to third place in the Pacific Conference, Western Division, for the 1977 season, taking them to the final of the Soccer Bowl before losing to Pel\u00e9's New York Cosmos.[19]\n\nDuring the 1978 season, Redknapp helped Seattle to a third-place finish in the National Conference, Western Division, before they lost in the first round of the playoffs, again to the New York Cosmos. In his final year in Seattle, he helped them to another third-place finish in the National Conference, Western Division, but this time they failed to qualify for the playoffs.[19]\n\nRedknapp then assisted his former West Ham teammate Bobby Moore at Isthmian League club Oxford City.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1982\u201383 season, Redknapp took up his first major coaching role as assistant manager to David Webb at AFC Bournemouth, six years after leaving the club as a player. Redknapp applied for the manager's job when Webb moved to Torquay United partway through that season, but was overlooked in favour of Don Megson. Megson was sacked in late 1983 as Bournemouth were in the Third Division relegation places, and Redknapp was hired as his replacement in October 1983.[20]\n\nIn his first season at the helm, Redknapp helped Bournemouth avoid relegation to the Fourth Division. Bournemouth also caused a shock in the FA Cup when they defeated holders Manchester United 2\u20130 in the third round.[21] He led Bournemouth to victory in the inaugural Associate Members' Cup by beating Hull City in the final.[22][23] Bournemouth won the Third Division title in 1987 with 97 points, breaking the club's record for the most points accumulated in a season.[24]\n\nAfter two years at this level, Bournemouth were relegated at the end of their third season. Bournemouth were in 13th position on 3 March, but injuries which depleted the squad, combined with a catastrophic loss of form, meant they won only one more match that season, and were relegated on 5 May after a 1\u20130 defeat at Dean Court against Leeds United.[25]\n\nIn June 1990, while in Italy to watch the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Redknapp was involved in a road accident along with Michael Sinclair, the chairman of York City, Fred Whitehouse, the chairman of Aston Villa, and Bournemouth's managing director, Brian Tiler. Travelling through Latina, south of Rome, at night, their chauffeur-driven minibus was in a head-on collision with a car containing three Italian soldiers. The minibus was flipped onto its roof and skidded 50 yards along the road. Sitting in the seat where Redknapp had usually sat during the trip,[26] Tiler was killed, as were the three occupants of the other vehicle. Redknapp was doused in petrol and pulled clear of the accident by Sinclair. Redknapp suffered a fractured skull, a broken nose, cracked ribs and a gash in his left leg. Ambulance services arriving at the scene believed him dead and placed a blanket over his head. Unconscious for two days, Redknapp was flown home two weeks later in a special air ambulance paid for by Bournemouth.[27] Though he made a full recovery, apart from losing his sense of smell and gaining a facial tic, he eventually quit Bournemouth at the end of the 1991\u201392 season.[28]\n\nFor the next season, Redknapp was appointed assistant manager to Billy Bonds at West Ham, another of his former clubs. However, in August 1994, the club board of directors opted to turn control of the team over to Redknapp and move Bonds into an administrative role. Bonds eventually resigned outright from the club, leaving Redknapp solely in charge.\n\nJust months before being promoted to the manager's seat at Upton Park, Redknapp was linked with the managerial vacancy at Southampton after the departure of previous manager Ian Branfoot, but the job went to Alan Ball instead.[29]\n\nRedknapp helped to establish the club in the FA Premier League and introduced a number of young players from the club's academy, including Michael Carrick, Joe Cole, Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard. The signings of Stuart Pearce, Paolo Di Canio and Trevor Sinclair helped them re-establish their careers having been signed by Redknapp. He also made mistakes in the transfer market, particularly with overseas players, including Marco Boogers, Florin Raducioiu and Paulo Futre.[30]\n\nNevertheless, West Ham finished in eighth position in 1998 and fifth in 1999, which saw them qualify for the UEFA Intertoto Cup in what was their second-best ever season in the top division. In the 1999\u20132000 season, West Ham won the Intertoto Cup and qualified for the UEFA Cup but failed to match their performances in the Premier League. Redknapp left West Ham on 9 May 2001, one match before the end of the 2000\u201301 season. For some time, it was unconfirmed whether he resigned or was sacked but Redknapp shed new light on the true circumstances in October 2007:\n\nThe chairman Terry Brown had offered me a new four-year contract. What I did was talk to a fanzine, made some comments, and sometimes I should be a bit more careful. I sat down with these guys from the fanzine and they started asking me questions and I spoke to them in the way I'd talk to someone in a pub. I said a few things I shouldn't have said. He read it and got very upset. I walked into his office expecting to sign the contract and walked out without a job!\nRedknapp became director of football for Portsmouth in 2001, and when the Leicester City manager's job became vacant with the dismissal of Peter Taylor that autumn, Redknapp was widely tipped to take over at the East Midlands club, but stayed loyal to Pompey, with the Leicester job going to Dave Bassett.[32] Ironically, it was reported in the national media that had Redknapp taken over, Bassett would have been on his coaching staff at the East Midlands club.[33]\n\nHowever, after the club's poor form, he replaced manager Graham Rix in March 2002. Redknapp managed the club to the Division One title in the 2002\u201303 season, gaining promotion to the Premier League, replacing his former club West Ham.\n\nRedknapp kept Portsmouth in the Premier League in the 2003\u201304 season, but had a dispute with Portsmouth owner Milan Mandari\u0107 over his assistant Jim Smith. Redknapp had another disagreement with Mandari\u0107 over the appointment of Velimir Zajec as director of football and resigned as manager in November 2004.[34]\n\nA few weeks after his departure at Portsmouth, Redknapp became manager of Southampton, a move which infuriated Portsmouth's supporters, as the two clubs are fierce local rivals. Some fans even bore T-shirts which referred to Redknapp as \"Scummer\" and \"Judas\" and called for him to \"Rot in Hell\".[35]\n\nRedknapp was tasked with keeping Southampton in the Premier League\u00a0\u2013 a similar task to the one Redknapp was facing with Portsmouth, and a familiar one at the club over the previous 15 years, which he would have faced had he accepted the offer to take over a decade earlier\u00a0\u2013 but ultimately was unable to achieve this, ending Southampton's 27-year spell in the top flight. Redknapp remained in charge for the 2005\u201306 Championship season but was unable to establish consistency needed to make Southampton promotion contenders. Redknapp was also unhappy with chairman Rupert Lowe's appointment of Clive Woodward to the club's coaching staff.[36] After being repeatedly linked with a return to Portsmouth after they sacked Alain Perrin, Redknapp resigned as Southampton's manager in early December 2005. Lowe quoted Redknapp as referring to Portsmouth as his \"spiritual home\".[37]\n\nRedknapp returned to Portsmouth on 7 December 2005 with the club threatened by relegation to the Championship, although not in the relegation zone. At first it looked like Redknapp would be heading for a second successive relegation, but a fine run of form at the end of the season, aided by the takeover of Portsmouth by Alexandre Gaydamak (which provided Redknapp with more money), ensured Portsmouth's survival. In the following season, Redknapp led Portsmouth to a ninth-placed finish which was the club's highest league finish since the 1950s. In October 2007, Redknapp signed a new contract at Portsmouth lasting until 2011.[38]\n\nIn January 2008, it emerged through the media that Redknapp was offered the vacant manager's job at Newcastle United following the sacking of Sam Allardyce. Redknapp had apparently declined the job, stating, \"I have a job to do to take this club forward and to walk away would not have been the right thing to do.\"[39] It was later stated by Newcastle chairman Christopher Mort that Redknapp \"was interviewed for the job but he was only one of a number of people we were speaking to at that time\", and at the time of Redknapp's interview the club had already been in secret talks with the eventual appointee, Kevin Keegan, for a week.[40]\n\nOn 8 March 2008, Redknapp led Portsmouth to an FA Cup quarter-final victory over Manchester United, completing a hat-trick of FA Cup wins over Manchester United, and followed this with a semi-final victory over West Bromwich Albion at Wembley Stadium on 5 April. He guided the club to their first FA Cup Final in 69 years, where they defeated Cardiff City on 17 May 2008 to win The FA Cup 1\u20130, thanks to a goal scored by Nwankwo Kanu.[4] He is the last English manager to win a major English trophy.[citation needed]\n\nRedknapp returned to Portsmouth to receive the Freedom of the City in a ceremony on 28 October 2008. As this event took place two days after his departure for Tottenham Hotspur, he received a mixed reception from the Portsmouth fans, despite having led the club to a long-awaited trophy in the 2008 FA Cup.[41]\n\nIn October 2008, following the sacking of Juande Ramos by Tottenham Hotspur, the club announced Redknapp had agreed to take over as the new manager at Spurs, the club where he began his playing career.[42] Tottenham paid \u00a35\u00a0million in compensation to Portsmouth for releasing Redknapp.[43] Spurs had secured only two points from the first eight matches of the season prior to Redknapp's arrival and lay bottom of the Premier League table, but in his first two weeks in charge, he took the club out of the relegation zone, winning 10 out of the 12 points available after wins against Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool and Manchester City,[citation needed] as well as a remarkable 4\u20134 draw against North London rivals Arsenal.[citation needed]\n\nIn January 2009, Redknapp signed five new players in order to add quality and much-needed depth to his squad. He brought back Jermain Defoe from his old club Portsmouth for \u00a315.75\u00a0million and Honduran midfielder Wilson Palacios from Wigan Athletic for \u00a312\u00a0million.[44] Long-serving Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini also joined on a free transfer; former Spurs player Pascal Chimbonda returned to White Hart Lane from Sunderland for a fee in the region of \u00a33\u00a0million; and Robbie Keane, who like Chimbonda and Defoe had only left Spurs within the last year, re-joined after an unsuccessful spell at Liverpool for an initial fee of \u00a312\u00a0million.[45]\n\nIn the second half of the season, Spurs gradually moved up the league table after a significant improvement in form. In March 2009, Redknapp led Spurs to the League Cup final, which they lost on penalties to Manchester United. Spurs eventually finished in eighth position with 51 points, narrowly missing out on a UEFA Europa League place.[citation needed]\n\nRedknapp made significant alterations to the squad in the summer of 2009. Striker Darren Bent was sold to Sunderland for an initial fee of \u00a310\u00a0million,[46] while midfielder Didier Zokora departed for Sevilla for \u00a37.75\u00a0million.[47] In came England international striker Peter Crouch and Croatia midfielder Niko Kranj\u010dar from Portsmouth for \u00a39\u00a0million and \u00a32\u00a0million respectively[48][49] along with defender S\u00e9bastien Bassong from Newcastle United for \u00a38\u00a0million.[50]\n\nIn 2009\u201310, his first full campaign with the club, Redknapp guided Spurs to one of their most successful Premier League campaigns to date. Beginning with four consecutive wins,[51] Spurs went on to finish in fourth place with 70 points, therefore gaining the chance to qualify for the UEFA Champions League via a play-off. As a result of his efforts, he won the Premier League Manager of the Year award, only the second manager to do so in a season when his side did not win the title.[52]\n\nOn 13 July 2010, it was confirmed Spurs had extended Redknapp's contract until the end of the 2013 season.[53]\n\nOn 25 August 2010, Spurs confirmed their position in the Champions League group stage by overturning a first-leg deficit to defeat Swiss team Young Boys at White Hart Lane in the Champions League play-off.[54] After a surprising run to the quarter-finals, Spurs were eliminated in April 2011 after a 5\u20130 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid.[55] Spurs ended the Premier League season in fifth position with 62 points. Although not enough to secure a second year of Champions League football, this finish instead meant that Redknapp's Spurs qualified for the Europa League.\n\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, Redknapp signed 40-year-old goalkeeper Brad Friedel after his contract expired with Aston Villa. He also made a season-long loan move for Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor. On transfer deadline day, he signed English midfielder Scott Parker for an undisclosed fee from West Ham.[56][57] Redknapp then went on to win the Premier League Manager of the Month award for September and November.[58][59]\n\nDespite leading Tottenham to their second fourth-placed finish in three years and missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification only due to Chelsea winning the competition, Redknapp was sacked by Tottenham on 13 June 2012,[60] after reportedly failing to agree terms on a new contract.[61]\n\nOn 24 November 2012, Redknapp, who had been working at former club Bournemouth in an advisory role,[62] was appointed as manager of Queens Park Rangers,[63] taking over from Mark Hughes, whose contract was terminated the previous day.[64] QPR were bottom with only four points from 12 matches.[65] His first match in charge of QPR came on 27 November, a 0\u20130 draw away to Sunderland.[66] Redknapp earned his first win as QPR manager, and the club's first Premier League victory of the 2012\u201313 season, on 15 December after defeating Fulham 2\u20131 at Loftus Road.[67]\n\nOn 2 January 2013, Redknapp led QPR to a 1\u20130 victory away from home against reigning European champions Chelsea. This was QPR's first away win in the Premier League since November 2011 and their first top flight victory at Stamford Bridge since March 1979.[68] His first match against Tottenham since being sacked by the North London club came on 12 January 2013, with Redknapp leading QPR to a 0\u20130 draw at Loftus Road.[69]\n\nOn 28 April 2013, after a 0\u20130 draw against fellow relegation rivals Reading, and with three matches of the season to play, QPR were relegated from the Premier League to the Championship after two seasons in the top flight.[70] After a single season in the Championship, Redknapp managed QPR to a 1\u20130 victory in the Play-off Final against Derby County on 24 May 2014 at Wembley Stadium, returning the club to the Premier League.[71][72] On 3 February 2015, Redknapp resigned as manager of QPR. With an imminent knee operation, Redknapp said that he could not give 100% to the job and that it would be better for someone else to take over as manager. Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey were placed in temporary charge.[73][74] In April 2015, Redknapp expanded on his reasons for leaving QPR, stating he had also left the club because he \"no longer knew who was on my side\".[75] At his time of departure, QPR were in second-last position in the Premier League with 19 points from 23 matches and a record zero points from away matches.[76]\n\nIn March 2016, Redknapp was appointed manager of Jordan national team alongside his former assistant, Kevin Bond, for the country's next two qualifying matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[77] Redknapp's first match as Jordan manager, on 24 March, ended in an 8\u20130 win over Bangladesh.[78] This was followed by a 5\u20131 defeat to Australia.[79]\n\nOn 18 April 2017, Redknapp was announced as the manager of Birmingham City until the end of the season after the resignation of Gianfranco Zola.[80] His first match in charge was a 1\u20130 loss to local rivals Aston Villa.[81] The final two matches of the season saw Redknapp's team beat Huddersfield Town 2\u20130,[82] followed by a 1\u20130 away win at Bristol City, allowing Birmingham to escape any threat of relegation.[83]\n\nIn May 2017, Redknapp signed a one-year deal to continue as Birmingham manager for another season.[84] Kevin Bond was reunited with Redknapp as assistant manager, replacing the outgoing Steve Cotterill.[85] His first signings were David Stockdale, Marc Roberts and Cheikh N'Doye.[86][87][88]\n\nOn 16 September 2017, after five straight league defeats that left the team second bottom in the table, a statement from Birmingham City said the club were \"left with no choice but to terminate the contract of the manager with immediate effect\".[89] After his sacking, Redknapp said that there was \"every chance\" his role as Birmingham manager would be his last managerial job.[90] A month later, Redknapp confirmed his retirement from management after 34 years in the dugout.[6]\n\nOn 16 February 2023, Redknapp revealed he would be interested in a return to club management via Leeds United after the dismissal of Jesse Marsch.[91] On 21 February 2023, Leeds would appoint Javi Gracia putting an end to the Redknapp rumours.[92]\n\nIn January 2016, Redknapp made a return to football as a director at Wimborne Town.[93] In March 2016, he was named as a football advisor for Derby County until the end of the 2015\u201316 season.\n\nOn 29 April 2016, it was announced that Redknapp was to join Australian side Central Coast Mariners as a football consultant.[94]\n\nIn October 2017, following his departure from Birmingham City, Redknapp briefly joined League Two club Yeovil Town in a voluntary advisory role to manager Darren Way.[95]\n\nOn 8 February 2021, Redknapp returned to Bournemouth to advise caretaker manager Jonathan Woodgate, though was not officially involved.[96][97]\n\nOn 9 July 2021, Redknapp made a small cameo appearance in the popular British soap opera, East Enders.[citation needed]\n\nOn 19 September 2006, Redknapp was shown on camera by BBC Panorama taking part in what appeared to be an interest in approaching a player in a manner forbidden by FA rules. Redknapp denied that his conversation about then-Blackburn Rovers player Andy Todd with the football agent Peter Harrison amounted to \"tapping up\" or improperly approaching the player. Redknapp referred to Todd as a \"tough bastard\" during the conversation and suggested he would be interested in signing the player on a full-time basis if he was available. Redknapp told the BBC he has never taken a bung and had given Kevin Bond no reason to think otherwise and that he considers himself to be \"one million percent innocent\".[98]\n\nIn the final report of the Stevens inquiry, published in June 2007, the only criticism of Redknapp concerned his ownership of a racehorse named Double Fantasy thought to have been given to him by the agent Willie McKay, which has aroused some suspicion. Redknapp told the inquiry it was possible he did own the horse but insisted he had not made any money out of it because the horse was a failure and never won a race.[99]\n\nOn 28 November 2007, Redknapp, along with Portsmouth's managing director Peter Storrie, former Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandari\u0107, agent Willie McKay and footballer Amdy Faye had been arrested by City of London Police on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting.[100] Redknapp was later released without charge and announced his intention to sue the police because of his arrest,[101] considering it as the reason for the failure of the FA to consider him for manager of the England national team after the sacking of Steve McClaren.[102] The High Court ruled in May 2008 that the raid by City of London Police officers, on Redknapp's home in Poole, was illegal and quashed the search warrants, calling their actions \"wholly unacceptable\"[103] and ordering them to pay \u00a31,000 damages to Redknapp as well as part of his legal costs.[104]\n\nFollowing further investigation by HM Revenue & Customs as part of the corruption enquiry,[105] in January 2010, Redknapp was charged with two counts of cheating the public revenue, along with Milan Mandari\u0107.[106] The charge related to a \u00a3189,000 payment from Mandari\u0107 to Redknapp via a bank account in Monaco. The trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 23 January 2012.[107] Part of Redknapp's defence was that he was both dyscalculic and dyslexic and therefore had difficulty in dealing with transfer contracts.[108] He was found not guilty on both counts on 8 February 2012.[109]\n\nRedknapp's acquittal came just hours before the resignation of England national team head coach Fabio Capello.[110] Two days later, he refused to rule himself out of the running for the job, but said it would be very difficult to combine the role with his then position as Tottenham manager.[111] A few weeks later, the FA appointed Roy Hodgson as manager.[112]\n\nRedknapp and his wife Sandra have two sons: Jamie, a football pundit and former professional footballer; and Mark, a model.[113] Jamie made his professional debut under his father at Bournemouth in 1990[114] before moving on to Liverpool and later Tottenham Hotspur and lastly Southampton before retiring in 2005.[115] Harry's grandson via his son Mark, also called Harry Redknapp,[116] signed for Bournemouth during May 2014.[117] His nephew is former England midfielder Frank Lampard, Jr. whose parents are Sandra's late twin sister, Patricia, and Harry's former teammate and managerial assistant Frank Lampard, Sr.[118]\n\nRedknapp and his wife are the fundraising presidents for the Southampton-based charity Leukaemia Busters, a role they took over in 2004 previously held by former cricketer David Gower and his wife Thorunn.[119]\n\nRedknapp and his wife also own a property development company, Pierfront Developments. In August 2011, it was announced that a housing development their company was building in Southsea, Hampshire, would go ahead without affordable housing. The \u00a3600,000 they offered to the council to build affordable homes elsewhere, was accepted by the council. Opponents of the scheme estimated this will only be enough to build eight homes instead of the 28 that council policy says they should be building in this development.[120] In October 2019, planning permission was granted for the company to convert a homeless shelter in Bournemouth into flats, despite pleas from residents who told planning authorities that the development would exacerbate homelessness and put their welfare at risk.[121]\n\nIn January 2011, Redknapp was mugged while attending a football match in Madrid.[122] On 2 November 2011, he had an operation to unblock coronary arteries.[123] Redknapp wrote for the online gambling company, Betfair, as its \"Euro 2012 columnist\".[124]\n\nIn 1998 Redknapp published his autobiography, Harry Redknapp: My Autobiography. It was co-written with Derek McGovern.[125] His second autobiography, Always Managing, was published in 2013.[126] It was ghostwritten by journalist Martin Samuel.[127]\n\nRedknapp was a contestant in the 2018 series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here![128] He subsequently won the show, and was crowned 'King of the Jungle'.[129]\n\nEngland U18\n\nAFC Bournemouth\n\nWest Ham United\n\nPortsmouth\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nQueens Park Rangers\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Redknapp"}, {"id": 70, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/88/1741029/original/owen-coyle-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Owen Coyle", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/owen-coyle/1741029", "desc": "Owen Columba Coyle (born 14 July 1966) is a former football player and manager.

He played as a striker for several clubs in England and Scotland, and made one appearance for the Republic of Ireland national team.\n\nCoyle began his career at Dumbarton, and also played for Clydebank and Airdrieonians before joining English club Bolton Wanderers in 1993. He appeared for Bolton in the Premier League before a return to Scotland with Dundee United. He went on to play for several other Scottish clubs, including Motherwell, Dunfermline Athletic, Falkirk and St Johnstone. Qualifying by descent, he played for the Republic of Ireland under-21s[6] and B team before he made one full international appearance in 1994.\n\nUpon retiring from playing, Coyle managed Falkirk and St Johnstone, before joining then Championship side Burnley in November 2007. In his first full season in charge, Burnley won promotion to the Premier League in 2009. He then moved to Bolton Wanderers in January 2010, halfway through his first season in the Premier League; Coyle stated this move was due to Bolton being \"ten years ahead of Burnley\".[7] After leaving Bolton in October 2012, Coyle was appointed manager of Wigan Athletic in June 2013, only to leave the club six months later. He was  made head coach of Houston Dynamo in December 2014, until he left by mutual agreement in May 2016. He then managed Blackburn Rovers between June 2016 and February 2017. He returned to Scotland to manage Ross County in September 2017, but resigned from this position after five months. \n\nOn 3 December 2019, Coyle was appointed as head coach of Indian club Chennaiyin. He led them from bottom of the table to the ISL final. After a stint with Jamshedpur, he returned to Scottish football in March 2022 with Queen's Park.\n\nCoyle began his senior career with Dumbarton in 1985 where he played alongside his brothers Joe and Tommy. In 1988, he joined Clydebank.\n\nIn March 1990 a \u00a3175,000 transfer took him to Airdrieonians for the first of three spells at the club. This move was instantly successful, Coyle scoring a hat-trick on his debut and going on to finish as the Scottish League's top scorer for 1989\u201390. Over the next two seasons his goals helped Airdrie to promotion, a Scottish Cup final appearance in 1992, and an appearance in the 1992\u201393 European Cup Winners' Cup[8] (as the Scottish Cup winners Rangers also won the Scottish Premier Division title and qualified for the UEFA Champions League).\n\nIn the summer of 1993, Bolton Wanderers paid \u00a3250,000 to sign Coyle, and his two-year spell in England included promotion and a brief chance to play in the FA Premier League. He was a key part of their Division One promotion winning side in 1995, scoring a 75th-minute goal against Reading in the playoff final which gave Bolton a lifeline to peg the scoreline back to 2\u20131. With 90 minutes on the clock, the score was 2\u20132 and Bolton won 4\u20133 in extra time to end their 15-year exile from the top flight.[9]\n\nHowever, in October 1995, a \u00a3400,000 transfer fee took him to Dundee United, where he was once again part of a promotion-winning side, scoring the winning goal in extra time in the second leg of the playoff against Partick Thistle.[10][11]\n\nCoyle's next move was to Motherwell in January 1997, after a move to Hibernian fell through.[12] In March 1999 he moved to Dunfermline Athletic. After losing his place in the Pars team, he went on loan to Ross County. He rejoined Airdrieonians in 2001 and won the Challenge Cup (scoring in the final)[13] but they went into liquidation in May 2002.[14]\n\nCoyle then joined Falkirk, being promoted to co-player-manager alongside John Hughes in 2003.[15] After leaving this post he returned to Dundee United, primarily in a coaching capacity but also registering as a player. A lack of first team opportunities, however, led to him being loaned out to Airdrieonians' successors, Airdrie United;[16] the move was subsequently made permanent. He also took up the post of assistant manager to Sandy Stewart.[17]\n\nHe played in an emergency for Burnley Reserves on 9 April 2009, scoring with a lob in a 2\u20130 win against Accrington Stanley, helping them win the Reserve League title.[18] On 7 October, Coyle played again for Burnley Reserves in a 1\u20130 defeat to the Liverpool Reserves at Prenton Park.[19]\n\nOn 15 November 2010, Coyle returned to playing action at the age of 44 when turning out for Bolton in their friendly match with Northern Ireland side Cliftonville. It was the first time in fifteen years that he had started a game for Bolton and he chipped in with a goal in a 2\u20130 Wanderers win.[20]\n\nAlthough born in Scotland, Coyle represented the Republic of Ireland under-21 team. Regarding his choice to represent Ireland, Coyle stated \"My ambition was to play at the highest level possible and, if I'm being totally honest, I didn't and still don't think I would have been good enough to play for Scotland. But the Irish watched me play six or seven times for Dumbarton and my first game for them was actually against Scotland.\"[2][3][4] Coyle's debut was in February 1987; he opened the scoring within two minutes, with Scotland going on to win 4\u20131.[21]\n\nCoyle made two substitute appearances (replacing David Kelly each time) for Republic of Ireland B against England B: at Turners Cross in Cork on 27 March 1990, and at Anfield on 13 December 1994.[22]\n\nCoyle went on to earn one full international cap for the Republic of Ireland team, in a friendly match played against the Netherlands in Tilburg in April 1994. The match ended in a 1\u20130 victory for the Republic, with Coyle coming on to replace the goalscorer Tommy Coyne in the 83rd minute.[23][24]\n\nIn April 2005, Coyle was named as the new manager of St Johnstone.[25] In March 2006, he was awarded Manager of the Month for the Scottish First Division for his team's performance. Coyle led St Johnstone to a 2\u20130 victory over Rangers at Ibrox to reach the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.[26] It was their first win over the Glasgow club at Ibrox in 35 years. St Johnstone lost 3\u20131 after extra time to Hibernian in that semi-final. Saints also reached the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup thanks to away wins against SPL clubs Falkirk and Motherwell, but lost 2\u20131 to Celtic at Hampden in the semi-final.[27]\n\nIn the same season, Saints also competed for the First Division championship and promotion to the SPL. On 30 March 2007, Coyle was awarded his second Scottish First Division Manager of the Month award of the 2006\u201307 season.[28] Saints took the title fight with Gretna to the final day of the season, and only a last minute goal by James Grady that gave Gretna victory at Ross County denied Saints promotion.\n\nCoyle signed a one-year extension to his contract with St Johnstone in July 2007, which would have kept him at the club until the end of the 2009\u201310 season.[29] In the early part of the 2007\u201308 season, Coyle led Saints to the 2007 Scottish Challenge Cup Final. He accepted an offer from Burnley in the week before the final and left the club. Coyle's assistant Sandy Stewart took charge of the team for the final, which was won 3\u20132 against Dunfermline Athletic.[30][31]\n\nOn 21 November 2007, Burnley were granted permission to discuss their managerial vacancy with Coyle after a compensation fee was agreed with St Johnstone.[32] He was appointed as Burnley's new manager the following day.[33] Coyle was given a reference by then Scotland manager Alex McLeish to support his Burnley application, and was also recommended by Bolton chairman Phil Gartside after they appointed Gary Megson as their new manager, as Coyle was Gartside's second choice for the Bolton job after Megson.[34]\n\nIn September 2008, former England striker Andrew Cole credited Coyle as the reason he re-thought his decision to retire from playing at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. Cole spent three months on loan at Burnley that season, and Cole stated, \"I went to Burnley and spoke to Owen and got a great vibe. He brought the best out of me and made me feel a lot younger than my age.\"[35]\n\nHe won the September 2008 Championship Manager of the Month award after leading Burnley to five wins and a draw, which included a League Cup win over Premier League side Fulham. In November Burnley secured a victory over Premier League side Chelsea on penalties at Stamford Bridge to put them in the quarter-finals of the League Cup. In the quarter-final, Burnley defeated Arsenal 2\u20130. They were knocked out in the semi-finals in dramatic fashion, after overturning a 4\u20131 deficit by winning 3\u20130 at Turf Moor after 90 minutes. Burnley were little more than three minutes away from a famous win and a trip to Wembley, when Roman Pavlyuchenko scored to win the tie in extra time for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nBurnley, under Coyle, won promotion to the Premier League by beating Sheffield United 1\u20130 in the Championship Play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 25 May 2009.[36]\nThe 2009\u201310 season was the first time Burnley had played in top tier of English football for 33 years. Coyle added to his squad by signing Tyrone Mears from Derby County for \u00a3500,000 and Steven Fletcher from Hibernian for a club record fee of \u00a33,000,000 and also David Edgar signed on a free transfer from Newcastle United on 1 July 2009.\n\nAfter speculation linking Coyle with the vacant manager's position at Celtic, on 18 June 2009, Coyle signed a contract extension at Turf Moor to stay with Burnley until the end of the 2012\u201313 season.[37]\n\nOn 19 August 2009, Burnley defeated the defending Premier League champions Manchester United 1\u20130 at Turf Moor in their first top-flight match at home for 33 years.[38] They went on to win their first four home games with wins against Everton 1\u20130 Birmingham 2\u20131 and Sunderland 3\u20131 and lose their first 5 away games.\n\nIn January 2010, Bolton Wanderers expressed their interest in Coyle becoming their new manager to replace the recently sacked Gary Megson, with Coyle expressing a desire to leave Burnley and take up the position. On 5 January, Burnley's chairman announced that Coyle had left the club.[39] On 8 January, Coyle was appointed as Bolton manager.[40] His first game in charge was a 2\u20130 home defeat to Arsenal.[41] He achieved his first win on 23 January 2010, 2\u20130 in the FA Cup 4th Round at home to Sheffield United and achieved his first league victory against former club Burnley, 1\u20130 on 26 January 2010.[42] He achieved his first away victory at the club on 6 March, 2\u20131 at West Ham United. When Bolton next played Burnley Coyle was called \"Judas\" by the Burnley fans as they felt that he had betrayed them. He responded to these comments by saying that if they (Burnley fans) were going to use biblical terms about him and his time in charge of their club, he should be referred to as 'Moses' for leading them out of the wilderness.[citation needed] Coyle's first signings for the club were Stuart Holden from MLS side Houston Dynamo on a short-term contract and Manchester City winger Vladimir Weiss and Arsenal's Jack Wilshere on loan until the end of the season. Coyle achieved his goal of keeping Bolton in the Premier League by finishing 14th with 39 points, nine clear of relegated Burnley.\n\nOn 1 July, he signed Martin Petrov from Manchester City and Robbie Blake from Burnley on free transfers, making them his first summer signings. Coyle also later signed Marcos Alonso from Real Madrid for an undisclosed fee and also brought Ivan Klasni\u0107 back to the club on a free transfer after spending the previous season on loan at the Reebok. In January 2011, he made two further signings, buying David Wheater from Middlesbrough and signing Daniel Sturridge on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. In his first full season at the club, Coyle's team finished 14th in the Premier League and reached the semi-final stage of the FA Cup, where they were beaten 5\u20130 by Stoke City.\n\nOn 13 May 2012, Bolton were relegated to The Championship, following a 2\u20132 draw at Stoke City on the final day of the season.\n\nBolton started the 2012\u201313 season against his former club Burnley, against whom they lost 2\u20130. They then went on to win against Derby County and draw against Nottingham Forest, both of which were at the Reebok Stadium. This meant the club had played three matches in a week. The following week, Bolton lost 3\u20131 to Hull City. In The Bolton News' report of the match, chief sports editor Marc Iles wrote, \"Sections of Wanderers fans called for Owen Coyle to leave his post as the club fell to a dire 3\u20131 defeat at the KC Stadium, The anti-Coyle chants continued after the final whistle, leaving the club potentially with a lot to think about heading into the international break.\"[43] The following match, against Watford was won 2\u20131, although fans still booed after the full-time whistle.[44] They then lost to Birmingham City 2\u20131 at St Andrew's. Coyle's time at the Reebok Stadium came to an end on 9 October 2012, when it was confirmed by the club that Coyle's contract with Bolton had been terminated.[45]\n\nOn 14 June 2013, Coyle was announced as the manager of Wigan Athletic following the departure of Roberto Mart\u00ednez to Everton.[46] His first game in charge of Wigan was against Barnsley in the Championship, which Wigan won 4\u20130. His second game was against Manchester United in the Community Shield where United won 2\u20130.[citation needed]\n\nCoyle left Wigan on 2 December 2013, with Wigan losing for the third time in a week, and lying 14th in the table.[47]\n\nOn 8 December 2014, Coyle signed a three-year contract to become the head coach of Major League Soccer club Houston Dynamo.[48] The announcement was previously delayed due to the MLS Cup Final.[49]\n\nOn 25 May 2016, Coyle and the club announced his departure by mutual consent, with Coyle stating his desire to be closer to his family who remained residing in the United Kingdom, while the Dynamo were not satisfied with the results on the pitch.[50]\n\nCoyle was appointed manager of Championship club Blackburn Rovers on a two-year contract on 2 June 2016.[51] After thirty-seven games in charge, Coyle mutually parted company with Blackburn on 21 February 2017.[52]\n\nOn 28 September 2017, Scottish Premiership club Ross County appointed Coyle as their manager on a two-year contract.[53] He resigned from this position on 1 March 2018, with the club sitting bottom of the league.[54]\n\nOn 3 December 2019, Indian Super League club 2 times champions Chennaiyin appointed him as their head coach.[55] After his arrival at Chennaiyin FC came back to their winning track, he changed their style of play. Chennaiyin FC scored majority goals in the season after his arrival as manager. Chennaiyin FC qualified to playoffs and reached the final under him and in final they lost to ATK  3\u20131 and became runners up of ISL.[56]\n\nOn 7 August 2020, Coyle was appointed the head coach of Indian Super League club Jamshedpur.[57] He helped the team winning their first ever trophy, the League Winner's Shield in 2021\u201322 season.\n\nIn March 2022, it was confirmed that Coyle would be returning to Scottish football after being appointed as the head coach of Queen's Park and would take up the role officially on 1 June.[58][59]\n\nCoyle was raised in the 'Little Donegal' area of the Gorbals, Glasgow,[60] to parents from Ireland and is a frequent visitor to Gweedore, County Donegal.[61] He made an appearance in the Scottish football film A Shot at Glory, in 2000, alongside The Godfather star Robert Duvall, Michael Keaton and Ally McCoist.[62]\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nAirdrieonians\n\nFalkirk\n\nAirdrie United\n\nIndividual\n\nFalkirk\n\nBurnley\n\nChennaiyin\n\nJamshedpur\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Coyle"}, {"id": 71, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/608/12157761/original/reuben-noble-lazarus-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Reuben Noble-Lazarus", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/reuben-noble-lazarus/12157761", "desc": "Reuben Courtney Noble-Lazarus (born 16 August 1993) is an English-born Grenadian professional footballer who is a free agent.

In 2014, Noble-Lazarus moved to Rochdale on loan until January 2015, but made a permanent transfer to them at the end of his loan spell for an undisclosed fee.\n\nNoble-Lazarus was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.[1] He came on as a substitute during Barnsley's 3\u20130 Championship defeat by Ipswich Town in October 2008 aged 15 years and 45 days.[2]\n\nThe previous weekend, Noble-Lazarus had scored a hat-trick for the Barnsley under-18 team,[3] for whom he had played since he was 12 years old,[4] and was selected as a substitute for the senior team's visit to Portman Road. Coming on in the 84th minute of the match to replace Martin Devaney, Noble-Lazarus surpassed the record of the youngest player in the Football League set by Bradford Park Avenue's Albert Geldard in September 1929, and equalled by Welshman Ken Roberts for Wrexham in 1951, by 113 days.[2] He was too young to be paid for his appearance \u2013 Barnsley manager Simon Davey joked he would be given pizza and a ham sandwich for his efforts[5] \u2013 and was due to return to Newsome High School[6] in Huddersfield the following day.[7]\n\nDavey had wanted to play Noble-Lazarus in the League Cup earlier in the season but was prevented from doing so by the competition's rules, which prohibit the selection of players under the age of 15. The club has made an agreement with Noble-Lazarus' school to allow him to train with the club for two days each week.[2] Davey said that the club would \"nurture\" Noble-Lazarus by ensuring that he is \"...dipped in and dipped back out...\" of the team.[8] Noble-Lazarus was included in Barnsley's squad to face Doncaster Rovers the weekend after his debut, making another substitute appearance when he came on for Iain Hume in the 87th minute.[9]\n\nUnder new boss Mark Robins, Noble-Lazarus was used twice as a substitute towards the end of the 2009/10 season.[10] As a result, Noble-Lazarus attracted interests from clubs in the Premier League, such as, Aston Villa and Manchester United, which he went on to have trial at.[11][12]\n\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Noble-Lazarus continued to develop at Barnsley and made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a late substitute for goalscorer Jacob Mellis, in a 4\u20131 loss against Leicester City on 5 February 2011.[13] He then made his first senior start against Doncaster Rovers in a 2\u20132 draw on 25 April 2011,[14] and scored his first senior goal as a substitute against Millwall on the last day of the 2010/11 season.[15] At the end of the 2010/11 season, Noble-Lazarus signed a contract extension with the club, signing a two-year deal.[16]\n\nThe 2011\u201312 season saw Noble-Lazarus making his first appearance of the season, playing 22 minutes as a substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss against Southampton on 13 August 2011.[17] However, he suffered ankle injury that kept him out for months.[18] Although he was making good progress of recovering from ankle injury,[19] it wasn't until on 2 January 2012 for Noble-Lazarus to make his first appearance since August, playing 37 minutes as a substitute, in a 2\u20130 loss against Doncaster Rovers.[20] He finished the 2011\u201312 season, making 9 appearances in all competition.\n\nAt the start of the 2012\u201313 season, Noble-Lazarus was sidelined for two months, due to suffering from an injury.[21] After returning from an injury, he made his first appearance of the season, where he played for 22 minutes as a substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss against Huddersfield Town on 11 November 2012.[22] Noble-Lazarus then scored his first Barnsley goal of the season, in a 2\u20132 draw against Leicester City on 8 December 2012.[23] Despite suffering from injuries,[24][25] Noble-Lazarus signed a two-year contract with the club, keeping him until 2015[26] and finished the season, making 15 appearances and scoring once in all competitions.\n\nWith a handful of first team appearances at Barnsley and had his first team opportunities limited,[27] Noble-Lazarus made his return to the first team at the club, where he played 13 minutes as a substitute, in a 2\u20130 win over Blackpool on 18 January 2014[28] and then scored his first goal two months later on 25 March 2014, in a 3\u20131 win over Reading.[29] After the club were relegated to the League One, he finished the 2013\u201314 season, making 12 appearances and scoring once for the club.\n\nAfter being told by the Barnsley management that he would be loaned out,[30] it was announced on 12 November 2013 that Noble-Lazarus signed on loan at League Two side Scunthorpe United until 1 January 2014.[31]\n\nNoble-Lazarus made his Scunthorpe United debut on 16 November 2013, where he played 45 minutes, in a 2\u20130 loss against Accrington Stanley.[32] Having made four appearances, he, however, suffered a groin injury in December.[33] Because he suffered a groin injury, the club decided against cancelling Noble-Lazarus's loan spell at Scunthorpe United.[34] and returned to his parent club on 1 January 2014.[35]\n\nDespite given a chance ahead of the new season,[36] Noble-Lazarus ended up making two appearances in all competitions, which both come from a league[37] and League Cup,[38] it was announced on 27 October 2014, Noble-Lazarus joined Rochdale on loan until January 2015.[39]\n\nNoble-Lazarus made his Rochdale debut on 15 November 2014, where he played for 22 minutes after coming on as a substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss against Port Vale on 15 November 2014.[40] Three days later on 18 November 2014, he scored his first Rochdale goal, in the first round replay of FA Cup, in a 2\u20131 win over Northampton Town.[41] Four days later, on 22 November 2014, he scored again, in a 2\u20132 draw against MK Dons.[42] On 13 January 2015, Noble-Lazarus completed a permanent switch to the club, signing an 18-month deal.[43] He went on to make twenty-three appearances and scoring once in all competition despite spending frequently on the substitute bench.\n\nThe 2015\u201316 season saw Noble-Lazarus starting well when he scored in the opening game of the season, in a 2\u20130 win over Peterborough United.[44] He continued to make a handful appearance in the first team until he dislocated his shoulder in training that kept him out sidelined for months.[45] After making his return to training in late-December,[46] Noble-Lazarus made his first team return on 16 February 2016, where he played 31 minutes after coming on as a substitute, in a 2\u20132 draw against Crewe Alexandra.[47] However, he once again suffered a hip problem.[48] and despite returning to training,[49] he never played again, making 10 appearances this season. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, Noble-Lazarus was among eight players to be released by the club.[50]\n\nHowever, on 14 July 2016, Noble-Lazarus re-signed for Rochdale for the second time, signing a one-year contract with the club.[51] Ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, his 11 shirt number was given to Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and wore number 16 shirt instead.[52] Unfortunately for Noble-Lazarus, he missed the start of the season, with an injury[53] After a month sidelined, Noble-Lazarus made his return to training.[54]\n\nIn October 2018, Noble-Lazarus joined National League North club Chorley, following an achilles injury.[55] In December 2018, Noble-Lazarus was released by Chorley.[56]\n\nIn February 2020 Noble-Lazarus joined Golcar United in Division One North of the North West Counties Football League.[57]\n\nOn 19 August 2020, Noble-Lazarus signed for Halifax Town.[58] He was released from Halifax Town after the 2020\u201321 season.[59]\n\nNoble-Lazarus, who is of Grenadian descent, expressed his desire to play for Grenada and wished to be part of the team for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Puerto Rico in June 2015.[60]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Noble-Lazarus"}, {"id": 72, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/22/432141/original/aliaksandr-hleb-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Alexander Hleb", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/aliaksandr-hleb/432141", "desc": "Aliaksandr Paulavich Hleb (Belarusian: \u0410\u043b\u044f\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041f\u0430\u045e\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0456\u0447 \u0413\u043b\u0435\u0431, pronounced [al\u02b2a\u02c8ksandar \u0263l\u02b2eb]; Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0413\u043b\u0435\u0431; born 1 May 1981), commonly referred to in English as Alexander Hleb,  is a Belarusian professional footballer who plays for Isloch Minsk Raion.Hleb's natural and preferred position is attacking midfielder or \"in the hole\" behind the strikers, but he is often deployed on the wing.

He is known for his passing, agility and dribbling ability.[3][4] A full international for Belarus since 2001, he won 80 caps for his country.\n\nHleb grew up in Minsk. His mother worked on a construction site while his father drove petrol tankers.[5] His father had volunteered to help demolish houses in Ukraine made uninhabitable as the result of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Hleb believes this exposure to radiation caused his father's ill health. Before getting involved with football, Hleb was a keen swimmer and gymnast.[6][7] His younger brother Vyacheslav is also a footballer.\n\nSpotted by scouts, Alexander and his younger brother Vyacheslav were signed in 2000 by German Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart for approximately \u20ac150,000.[8] He made his Bundesliga debut on 5 September 2000 in an away match at 1. FC Kaiserslautern, coming on as a substitute for the last 20 minutes.[9] Despite only making six league appearances in his first season with Stuttgart, Hleb became a regular at the club in his second season there and went on to establish himself as an important player for the team. In 2002, he was voted Belarusian Footballer of the Year.[10]\n\nIn 2002\u201303, Stuttgart finished as runners-up in the Bundesliga and enjoyed a UEFA Champions League victory over Manchester United and Hleb had become established as the team's playmaker. After team manager Felix Magath left to join Bayern Munich in the summer of 2004, however, Stuttgart were not as successful under new coach Matthias Sammer, having finished the 2004\u201305 season in fifth place.[11]\n\nIn June 2005, Hleb joined English side Arsenal for a sum which had the potential to reach \u20ac15\u00a0million, on a four-year contract.[12] Ars\u00e8ne Wenger used Hleb at many different midfield positions, but he mainly played on the right wing for Arsenal. His competitive debut was made in August 2005 against Chelsea in the 2005 FA Community Shield, and then he made his league debut as a substitute against Newcastle United.[13][14] Soon after, Hleb sustained a knee injury while on international duty with Belarus and was out for several months, returning to the first team squad in December, and played 60 minutes in Arsenal's final UEFA Champions League group stage match against Ajax on 7 December.[15] By January 2006, Hleb had established himself as a first choice player and scored his first goal for Arsenal in a 7\u20130 win over Middlesbrough.[16] In May, Hleb became the first ever Belarusian footballer to play in the Champions League final.[17] He ended the season with 40 appearances and three goals.\n\nDespite a hamstring injury, Hleb made 48 appearances in the 2006\u201307 season and scored three goals. In 2007\u201308, he was moved from the right wing and played behind Robin van Persie as a withdrawn striker. When strikers Emmanuel Adebayor and Eduardo recovered from injuries Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reverted to a 4\u20134\u20132 formation and Hleb returned to playing on the wing. His season was cut short after he was banned for three games by the FA after he was charged with violent conduct in an incident with Graeme Murty of Reading during their 2\u20130 win. Hleb admitted his offence, ending his season.\n\nOn 16 July 2008, a medical examination was held for the player at FC Barcelona, with his transfer completed later that day for a fee of \u20ac15\u00a0million plus an additional \u20ac2\u00a0million if Barcelona won the La Liga title in 2008\u201309 or 2009\u201310 (which they did in 2008\u201309, bringing his total fee to \u20ac17\u00a0million). Hleb signed a four-year contract with a buy-out clause of \u20ac90\u00a0million.[18]\n\nIn March 2009, after featuring irregularly for the team \u2013 starting only five games in La Liga \u2013 Hleb admitted that he would readily accept an offer from Bayern Munich, if such an opportunity arose in the summer. He said, \"I am right in the best years of my career and I do not want to spend those years on bench. Bayern Munich is a special club, their interest in me is a delightful honour. Bayern is among the best teams in the world.\"[19]\n\nHleb went on to win the 2008\u201309 treble with Barcelona in his first season with the club. Hleb featured briefly in the Copa del Rey final but did not play when Barcelona went on to beat Manchester United 2\u20130 in the Champions League final.\n\nAt the end of the season, Hleb turned down the opportunity to join, on loan, eventual 2009\u201310 treble winners Internazionale, and chose to join former club, VfB Stuttgart, on loan.[20]\n\nIn July 2009, Hleb returned to VfB Stuttgart on a one-year loan.[21][22][23][24]\nHleb played 55 minutes in the first game of the 2009\u201310 Bundesliga season, away to VfL Wolfsburg, a match Stuttgart lost 2\u20130. Then, after playing in Stuttgart's 4\u20132 victory over SC Freiburg, Hleb scored his first goal for Stuttgart, during a Champions League qualifier against Timi\u0219oara in a 2\u20130 away win for the German side.\n\nOn 31 August 2010, Hleb returned to England by signing a season-long loan deal with Premier League club Birmingham City.[25] An ankle injury sustained on international duty delayed his debut until 18 September, when he played 83 minutes in a 3\u20131 defeat at West Bromwich Albion.[26][27] Three days later, he opened the scoring as Birmingham beat Milton Keynes Dons 3\u20131 in the League Cup.[28] Injury disrupted his season, forcing him to miss Birmingham City's victory over Arsenal in the League Cup final. Towards the end of the season, he ruled out a return to Birmingham once his loan expired, suggesting that their style of football was not suited to him, although he wanted to remain in the Premier League, ideally at Arsenal.[29][30]\n\nOn 31 August 2011, Hleb was loaned out to VfL Wolfsburg.[31] Again, injury disrupted his stay at Wolfsburg, making only one start and three appearances as a substitute.[32] The club confirmed he would leave at the scheduled end of the loan on 31 December 2011.[33]\n\nAfter Hleb's contract with Barcelona was cancelled by mutual consent during the January 2012 transfer window,[34] he signed for Russian Premier League club Krylia Sovetov Samara until the end of the season.[35]\n\nOn 26 July 2012, Hleb signed a contract with BATE Borisov and won the 2012 Belarusian Premier League in his return season. Hleb stated before BATE's 3\u20131 win against Bayern Munich that he expected the great performances of his team in the Champions League could help him to earn a move abroad, with the player wanting a move to a Bundesliga club.[36] However, he remained playing for BATE in the 2013 season.\n\nOn 4 January 2014, Hleb signed a contract with Torku Konyaspor in the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig for one-and-a-half years, with an option to extend the contract for an additional year.[37] In February 2015, Hleb left Konyaspor for S\u00fcper Lig rivals Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi.[38] Further spells at FK BATE Borisov, Krylia Sovetov Samara and Isloch Minsk Raion followed at the end of his club career.[39]\n\nHleb won over 20 caps for the Belarus under-21 side. He made his full international debut as a substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat against Wales in 2001. He scored on his second international start in a 5\u20132 victory over Hungary in April 2002. He scored a goal in the finals of the 2002 LG Cup, which Belarus won.[40]\n\nIn November 2006, former Belarusian captain Sergei Gurenko strongly criticised Hleb for not working hard in national team settings. Hleb, however, rejected any suggestion that he was a \"prima donna\".[41] In August 2007, new national team manager Bernd Stange made Hleb team captain despite the criticism. On 22 August, Hleb wore the captain's armband for the first time in a 2\u20131 win against Israel. He was part of the team at the victorious friendly Malta International Football Tournament in 2008.[42] Overall he won 80 caps.[43]\n\nHleb was called \"Zauberlehrling\" or \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" for his silky skills and dazzling tricks in Germany when he played in the Bundesliga.[44]\n\nIn 2003, Hleb was involved in a car crash in Minsk, after which a passenger in the other car died in hospital. Hleb was cleared of any responsibility for the accident.[7]\n\nWhile playing for Arsenal, Hleb lived in Hampstead, North London.[7] In a 2009 interview with The Guardian newspaper, Hleb confessed that the biggest regret of his life was leaving Arsenal for Barcelona.[45]\n\nHleb was married to Anastasia Kosenkova, ex-singer of the Belarusian pop group Topless, from 2008 until 2014.[46] In summer 2016, he married Sviatlana.[47] His first child, a daughter, was born in December of that year.[47] Sviatlana's daughter from a previous marriage lives with the couple.[48]\n\nBATE Borisov\n\nVfB Stuttgart\n\nArsenal\n\nBarcelona\n\nBirmingham City\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hleb"}, {"id": 73, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/361/7212474/original/zoltan-pet-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Zolt\u00e1n Pet\u00f6", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/zoltan-pet\u00f6/7212474", "desc": "Zolt\u00e1n Pet\u0151 (born 19 September 1974) is a Hungarian football (soccer) defender.

Sports journalist Jim Taylor would write a football biography of Young featuring the same name.\n\nYoung was the first CIS football player, playing for Queen's University, drafted into the National Football League in 1965. He played Running back/halfback for the Minnesota Vikings in the 1965 and 1966 seasons (playing 6 games, rushing 3 times for 4 yards, and returning 6 punts and 9 kickoffs).\n\nYoung ended up signing with the Canadian Football League's BC Lions in a multi-player \"trade\" between the NFL and the CFL teams, one of the very few transactions to ever occur between the two leagues.[citation needed]\n\nYoung wanted to return to Canada, and the BC Lions were very interested in acquiring him, however the Toronto Argonauts had his CFL rights.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings were very interested in signing BC Lions quarterback Joe Kapp.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings general manager at the time was Jim Finks, who had brought Kapp to Canada back in the 1959 CFL season, and their head coach was Bud Grant who had faced Kapp while coaching the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Both Finks and Grant, wanted to sign Joe Kapp to replace Fran Tarkenton who had been traded to the New York Giants.\n\nTo make this transaction possible, the BC Lions traded all-star defensive lineman Dick Fouts, and future Canadian Football Hall of Fame running back Bill Symons to the Argonauts for the CFL rights to Young. They then managed getting Kapp waived out of the Canadian Football League.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings managed getting Young waived out of the NFL. The expansion New Orleans Saints wanted Young and it took some work from Finks to keep them from claiming Young.\n\nYoung, now waived from the NFL, signed with the BC Lions and Joe Kapp, who was waived from the CFL, was free to sign with the Minnesota Vikings, who had previously claimed his NFL playing rights from the Washington Redskins.\n\nYoung played from the 1967 to 1979 season with the BC Lions for 197 games, primarily as a wide receiver. Young was named a CFL All-Star at wide receiver for the 1972 season, and was a two-time Western Conference All Star at two positions (running back in 1969, wide receiver in 1972). Young was awarded the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian Award in the 1970 and 1972 seasons.\n\nHe gained a reputation for his hard nosed play, hence the nickname \"Dirty 30\". His style of play forced defensive backs to watch out for him.\n\nYoung previously held several BC Lions team records, including most receptions, 552, most receiving yards, 9248, and most receiving touchdowns, with 65. These are now all held by Geroy Simon. He is one of only two Lions to surpass the 10,000 yard mark overall and he dominated the Lions offence for many years despite playing with 23 different quarterbacks. He saw action in five playoff seasons for B.C. and still ranks as the fifth all-time leading scorer in club history at 410 points.\n\nYoung's #30 jersey is one of ten numbers retired by the Lions.[2]\n\nYoung joined the BC Lions team management after his retirement, and coached the Lions on an interim basis during the 1990 CFL season for one game (a 32-13 loss to the Edmonton Eskimos.\n\nIn 1991, Young was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

He was also managed the Great Britain Olympic Football Team during the 1950s and 1960s, whilst working for the Football Association.[12]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Creek_(footballer)"}, {"id": 76, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/103/2057148/original/sol-campbell-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Sol Campbell", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/sol-campbell/2057148", "desc": "Sulzeer Jeremiah Campbell  (born 18 September 1974) is an English professional football manager and former player who served as the manager of League Two club Macclesfield Town from November 2018 to August 2019.

He previously managed Macclesfield Town from November 2018 to August 2019. A centre-back, he spent 20 years playing in the Premier League and had an 11-year international career with the England national team.\n\nBorn in East London to Jamaican parents, Campbell began his career with Tottenham Hotspur in December 1992. He spent nine years at Spurs, scoring 10 goals in 255 appearances, and captaining the team to victory in the 1999 Football League Cup Final against Leicester City. In 2001, he joined Tottenham's North London rivals Arsenal on a free transfer, and as a result has remained a deeply unpopular figure amongst Spurs supporters. In his five years and 195 appearances at Arsenal, he won two Premier League winners medals and two FA Cup winners medals, encompassing the 2001\u201302 league and FA Cup double, and being part of the team that became known as The Invincibles for their undefeated 2003\u201304 Premier League campaign. He scored Arsenal's only goal in their 2\u20131 defeat to Barcelona in the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. In August 2006, he joined Portsmouth on a free transfer. His three years with the club included captaining them to victory in the 2008 FA Cup Final. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he made the surprise move of dropping down three levels of the English football pyramid to join League Two side Notts County on a free transfer. He left the club by mutual consent in September 2009, having played just one match for the club. The next year, he made a brief return to Arsenal before ending his career with Newcastle United.\n\nHaving already won caps for the England under-21s and England B team, Campbell gained his first of 73 full caps for England aged 21. In May 1998, Campbell became what was then England's second-youngest captain, after Bobby Moore, aged 23 years 248 days. In 2006, he became the only player to have represented England in six consecutive major tournaments, playing in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 UEFA European Championships; and the 1998, 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. He was named in the Teams of the Tournament for the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Other honours in the game include being in the PFA Team of the Year three times, in 1999, 2003 and 2004.\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell announced his ambition to be the Conservative Party candidate for Mayor of London in the 2016 election, but he was not shortlisted.\n\nCampbell was born in Plaistow, London, to Jamaican parents Sewell and Wihelmina.[3] He was the youngest of twelve children, nine of whom were boys.[4] His father was a railway worker and his mother, Wihelmina, was a Ford factory worker.[4] Despite growing up in a rough neighbourhood in a family with very little money, Campbell veered away from a life of crime due to his strict parents.[5]\n\n\"I became a recluse within my own house. I became insular because at home there was no space to grow or to evolve, everything was tight and there was no room to breathe. People don't realise how that affects you as a kid. I wasn't allowed to speak, so my expression was football.\"\nCampbell attended the Portway Primary School in Plaistow, London and had secondary education at Lister Community School in Plaistow, London.[7] He was a prodigious schoolboy talent and was part-educated at the FA's School of Excellence at Lilleshall, where he met table tennis player and later football agent Sky Andrew.[8] Campbell had a short spell at West Ham United, beginning his career as a striker.[5] He left the Youth programme at Upton Park after a coach joked to him that Campbell would be pleased to hear that the West Indies were beating England at cricket; Campbell took this to be offensive.[9]\n\nFollowing his experience at West Ham United, Campbell was reluctant to join another professional club's youth programme, but after two months of persistence from Tottenham Hotspur's chief scout Len Cheesewright, he eventually joined the Tottenham Youth team.[10] Youth team manager Keith Waldon later recalled that it was his physicality rather than his technical ability which made him stand out as a good prospect for the future.[11] At age 14, he was one of only 16 young footballers accepted onto a training programme at Lilleshall Hall.[12] Waldon offered to make him captain of the youth team, but Campbell declined the offer as he wanted to concentrate on his own game.[13]\n\nCampbell made his first team debut for Spurs on 5 December 1992 against Chelsea at White Hart Lane, scoring the goal in a 2\u20131 defeat after coming on as a substitute for Nick Barmby.[14] Despite this start to his career, he was not picked by manager Terry Venables again throughout the remainder of the 1992\u201393 season.\n\nNew boss Osvaldo Ardiles played him at left back at the start of the 1993\u201394 season in place of the injured Justin Edinburgh, before he was switched to right back in place of Dean Austin.[15] At the end of the season, he signed a four-year contract with the club.[16]\n\nNew manager Gerry Francis led the club to the semi-finals of the FA Cup in the 1994\u201395 campaign, but Campbell missed the match due to injury and Spurs were beaten by Everton.[17] Campbell continued to progress in his performances, but Spurs struggled to mid-table league finishes in the 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397 seasons.[18] Francis appointed Campbell as club captain, taking over the role from the out of favour David Howells.[19] He had a strained relationship with short-lived manager Christian Gross during the 1997\u201398 season as Spurs again struggled.[20] Gross's replacement, George Graham, also had a difficult relationship with Campbell.[21]\n\nCampbell successfully captained his side to a League Cup final win over Leicester City in the 1998\u201399 season. This made him the first black captain to lift a major trophy at Wembley Stadium.[22] He was also named on the PFA Team of the Year, as was teammate David Ginola.[23]\n\nThe League Cup success qualified Spurs to compete in the UEFA Cup during the 1999\u20132000 campaign, but they only made it into the Second Round before they were beaten by German side 1. FC Kaiserslautern.[24] During this time, he was falsely accused of breaking a stewards arm during a scuffle in a game at Derby County, and refused Tottenham's lawyer's advice to have the case Bound over (meaning he would not be convicted but would effectively have admitted some level of wrongdoing), and was subsequently told by the club to field his own legal defence for the case.[25] The case was later dismissed.[26] The club's lack of progress in the league, his poor relationship with recent managers and the club's lack of support during the assault case left Campbell feeling disillusioned with Spurs.[25]\n\nCampbell missed three months of the 2000\u201301 campaign after dislocating his shoulder in a 0\u20130 League Cup draw with Brentford at Griffin Park.[27] He made his final appearance for the club in the FA Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford. Manager Glenn Hoddle admitted it was a risk to play Campbell as the defender was not at full fitness, and he injured his ankle fouling Ray Parlour before he was eventually replaced by Ledley King. However, before the substitution could be made, Patrick Vieira scored a header for Arsenal while Campbell was off the pitch receiving treatment.[28]\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Campbell's contract expired. Mindful of the Bosman ruling and what happened with Steve McManaman (Britain's first high-profile Bosman related transfer), Tottenham offered him a contract which would have made him the club's highest-ever paid player,[29] but after months of negotiations and several public assurances he would stay at Spurs, Campbell stated his need to leave the club in order to play UEFA Champions League football, with the likes of England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson advising him of such a course.[30] Several top continental clubs expressed interest in signing him, but he joined Arsenal\u00a0\u2013 Tottenham's biggest rivals\u00a0\u2013 on a free transfer. Campbell had previously stated in an interview with Spurs Monthly magazine that he would never play for Arsenal.[31] The move was also unusual as no rumours of a move to Arsenal had been leaked or speculated upon in the media before the press conference revealing his decision, and many journalists in attendance had been led to believe they were there to witness the unveiling of goalkeeper Richard Wright, which would have been a routine sports news story.[32]\n\nCampbell has been labelled \"Judas\" by some Spurs supporters.[31][33] Years later, the anger from Spurs supporters remained. In January 2009, four Tottenham fans were banned from every football ground in England and Wales for three years after being found guilty of chanting an offensive song containing indecent language (with homophobic content and content which some observers interpreted as racist) aimed at Campbell.[34][35]\n\n\"[Arsenal vice-chairman] David Dein made me feel protected. He was going to help and promised to be there for me. Come to us, he said, and you will be part of our family. We will protect you.\"\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger later said he signed Campbell as he found that when playing against him, his attackers could not pass him like they could other players and that \"it was as if he was indestructible, such a power spread from him\".[37] He made his debut for the Gunners on 18 August \u2013 the opening day of the 2001\u201302 Premier League season, in a 4\u20130 win over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium.[38] During the season, Campbell was partnered at the back by either Tony Adams (who would retire at the end of the season) or Martin Keown.[39] He made a return to White Hart Lane during a 1\u20131 draw on 17 November, and though he played well, he was shocked to see his older brother Tony in the crowd supporting Spurs as the fans shouted insults out to Campbell on the pitch.[40] Campbell enjoyed immediate success with Arsenal, as he won both Premier League and FA Cup winners' medals as Arsenal won the Double in his first season at Highbury. In the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium on 4 May, he played alongside Adams as the team kept a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 victory over Chelsea.[41] Four days later, they secured the league title with a 1\u20130 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford.[42]\n\nThe 2002\u201303 season saw Arsenal exit the Champions League at the group stage, but remained on course for a retention of the Double as they reached the final of the FA Cup. However, he missed the end-of-season run-in due to suspension after referee Mark Halsey gave him a straight red card for an alleged elbow on Manchester United's Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.[43] The club appealed the suspension but were unsuccessful, and he was forced to miss the cup final as Arsenal defeated Southampton to retain the trophy, though they ended the league campaign in second place.[44] His performances were recognised with a place on the PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammates Lauren, Ashley Cole, Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires and Thierry Henry.[45]\n\n\"Sol had become one of our main players, and we now had an absolute physical presence and stability at the back. He is monstrous and, with his full power and also his ability to score a goal, you have an outstanding player. With Jens Lehmann, Ashley Cole, Lauren, Tour\u00e9, they were all winners.\"\n\nWenger speaking on Campbell and the defence of the Invincibles season.[46]\n\nThe following season, 2003\u201304, would be known as \"The Invincibles season\" as Campbell formed a new partnership with Kolo Tour\u00e9, with the pair instrumental in helping Arsenal regain the Premier League title without losing a single match. The title was secured with a 2\u20132 draw with Spurs at White Hart Lane on 25 April.[47] He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career, alongside teammates Lauren, Cole, Vieira, Pires and Henry.[45]\n\nCampbell missed the start of the 2004\u201305 season with a knee injury, and so missed the 2004 FA Community Shield victory over Manchester United.[48] The unbeaten run continued to a record 49 matches before Manchester United defeated them 2\u20130 at Old Trafford on 24 October in a match that would become known as the \"Battle of the Buffet\".[49] Referee Mike Riley gave a penalty after Campbell challenged Wayne Rooney, though Campbell would maintain that the young striker had taken a dive.[49][50] Towards the end of the campaign, Wenger began playing Kolo Tour\u00e9 and one of Pascal Cygan and Philippe Senderos in central defence, and Campbell was benched, leaving him to complain to the manager that Senderos was a \"lucky player\" who should not be considered good enough to play at Campbell's expense.[51] Arsenal again finished second in the league and won the FA Cup final at Manchester United's expense, though Campbell was an unused substitute in the match.[52]\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Campbell was blighted both with injuries and a loss of form.[53][54] In Arsenal's 3\u20132 home loss to West Ham United on 1 February, Campbell was largely responsible for West Ham's first two goals before being substituted at half-time at his own request.[55] Unusually, he then left the stadium, not staying to watch the second half. His teammate Robert Pires commented that Campbell was facing a \"big worry\" in relation to his private life,[56] and Campbell did not make any contact with the club for several days. He left the country and spent a week with a friend in Brussels as he reflected on his life.[57] He resumed training with his teammates on 6 February.[58]\n\nCampbell was back playing on 25 April in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final against Villarreal in Spain, where a 0\u20130 draw on the night put the Gunners into the final.[59] In the final against Barcelona at the Stade de France, Paris, Campbell scored the opening goal, a header from a free-kick taken from Henry after a foul on Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9.[60] However, ten-man Arsenal went on to lose 2\u20131, although Campbell was at least involved in the best defensive run of any team in the history of the competition, with opponents failing to score against Arsenal in ten consecutive matches and a total of 995 minutes.[61] Campbell also holds the distinction, alongside Teddy Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney, as one of six Englishmen to have scored in a Champions League final.[62] In July 2006, Campbell left Arsenal by mutual consent in order to seek \"a fresh challenge\".[63]\n\nCampbell was courted by Italian club Juventus, but manager Didier Deschamps eventually ended contract negotiations. Campbell then rejected an approach from Turkish side Fenerbah\u00e7e.[64] Instead, he remained in England and joined Premier League club Portsmouth, signing a two-year contract in August 2006.[65] His time at Pompey started well, as he formed a successful partnership in the centre of defence with Linvoy Primus and helped the club to keep five consecutive clean sheets. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 win over Sheffield United on 23 December.[66]\n\nHe was named as captain for the 2007\u201308 season by manager Harry Redknapp, and signed a new two-year contract with the club.[67] He captained the club to a 1\u20130 win over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium in the 2008 FA Cup Final.\n\nThe club went into severe financial difficulties, and Redknapp resigned, but Campbell stayed and helped the club to avoid relegation in the 2008\u201309 campaign.[68] In January 2010, Campbell sued Portsmouth for \u00a31.7\u00a0million in unpaid image rights and bonus payments.[69]\n\n\"I enjoyed my spell at Portsmouth; it was like going back to a different time. Everyone was up against it, mucking in.\"\nCampbell signed a five-year deal with League Two side Notts County in August 2009.[71] Campbell said that County, who had recently been the subject of a takeover by a Middle Eastern consortium, were the best club for \"where I am at the moment in my life\", and that the recent appointment of ex-England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson as director of football played a \"big role\" in his decision. He made his debut for County in a 2\u20131 defeat to Morecambe at Christie Park on 19 September.[72] He walked out on the club three days later, and his contract was cancelled by mutual consent on 24 September. He later admitted he felt embarrassed and that \"I was being a mug\" in believing the club's owners were ambitious billionaires who intended to take the club into the Premier League.[73]\n\nCampbell began training with the Arsenal side in mid-October 2009 in a bid to maintain his fitness ahead of the January transfer window.[74] On 15 January, he re-signed with the club.[75] It was announced he would wear the number 31 shirt.[76] Nine days later, he made his second debut for the Gunners in an FA Cup defeat to Stoke City. On 18 February, he scored his first goal in his second stint at the club with a headed goal against Porto in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16.[77] Due to injuries to Thomas Vermaelen and William Gallas towards the end of the season, he found himself starting frequently for Arsenal.\n\nIn July 2010, after turning down an offer of a two-year contract with Scottish club Celtic, Campbell joined Newcastle United on a one-year contract.[78] He made his first appearance for the Magpies in a League Cup win over Chelsea on 22 September.[79] On 3 October, he made his Premier League debut for the club as a 38th-minute substitute for Fabricio Coloccini in a 2\u20131 defeat to Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium. In doing so, he became only the second player after Ryan Giggs to play in the first 19 seasons of the Premier League.[80] On 28 November, Campbell made his first Premier League start for Newcastle against Chelsea, and was given the captain's armband after Shola Ameobi was substituted. Campbell started again in Newcastle's next two fixtures with West Bromwich Albion and Liverpool, but lost his place upon the return of Coloccini. After a long period out with viruses, Campbell returned to bench duty in January, making his first appearance in two months as a substitute in Newcastle's 2\u20130 win over Birmingham City on 15 February.\n\nIn May 2011, manager Alan Pardew announced Campbell was a free agent after the club opted not to renew his contract.[81] Campbell announced his retirement from football a year later in May 2012.[82]\n\nCampbell was a regular through the various England youth teams, and picked up two man of the match awards during the 1993 UEFA European Under-19 Championship which England won with a 1\u20130 win over Turkey.[83]\n\nCampbell made his international debut as a substitute against Hungary on 18 May 1996. Although he had only one cap by the time Terry Venables selected his squad for UEFA Euro 1996, Campbell made the squad as defensive cover. He won his second cap in England's 2\u20130 group stage match against Scotland, again as a substitute.\n\n\"When I put on the England shirt, I had a collection of thoughts. It was like going into battle, fighting for your team and your country. I would think that I'm playing against the best players in the world and would love that I could master them, control them and nullify them.\"\n\nHis international career was an immense source of pride for Campbell.[84]\n\nOver the next two years, under new manager Glenn Hoddle, Campbell became a regular member of England's defence, partnering Gareth Southgate and Tony Adams. On 29 May 1998, aged 23 years and 248 days, Campbell became England's second-youngest captain after Bobby Moore[85] in a 0\u20130 draw against Belgium, though Michael Owen subsequently overtook Campbell after captaining England against Paraguay in April 2002.[85] Campbell started all four of England's matches in the 1998 World Cup.\n\nDuring the 1998 World Cup, Campbell was involved in a highly controversial incident in England's second round clash against Argentina.[86] With less than ten minutes to play, the score was 2\u20132 and England were down to ten men after David Beckham was sent off.[87] Campbell headed a corner into the Argentine net and wheeled away to celebrate his first international goal, which appeared to be the winning goal which would have put England into the quarter finals. However, the referee disallowed the goal after ruling that Alan Shearer had illegally contacted the goalkeeper, and England eventually lost the match on penalties.[88]\n\nCampbell was England's first-choice centre back throughout the successful qualification campaign for Euro 2000 under new boss Kevin Keegan, and played in all three group games at the tournament, which England exited after defeat by Romania.[89]\n\nAfter the retirement of Tony Adams, Campbell partnered Rio Ferdinand in England's successful qualification campaign for the 2002 World Cup, held in Korea and Japan. He scored his only senior international goal at the tournament, a header off a corner kick by Beckham in the opening group game against Sweden.[90] The match ended 1\u20131, but in their next match, England defeated Argentina 1\u20130.[91] Campbell's partnership with Ferdinand was an integral part of a strong defensive performance throughout the tournament, and he was the only England player to be named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. England progressed to the quarter-finals, where they lost to eventual winners Brazil despite playing the last 30 minutes against ten men.[92]\n\nCampbell maintained his place in the centre of defence as he took part in England's successful qualification campaign for Euro 2004. England went on to reach the quarter-finals clash with hosts Portugal, and with the score tied at 1\u20131, Campbell won a header in the opposition six-yard box to score what seemed to be a late winner for England.[93] However, referee Urs Meier decided that John Terry had pushed Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo and instead gave a free-kick.[93] The game ended 2\u20132 after extra time, and England lost the penalty shoot-out.[93]\n\nCampbell continued to play for England after Euro 2004, although his place in the international team had become less secure since the emergence of the central defensive partnership of Terry and Ferdinand, which blossomed during Campbell's period of absence with injury in 2005.[93] He was named in England's squad for the 2006 World Cup, but was third-choice centre back, with coach Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson preferring the partnership of Ferdinand and Terry. However, after a knock to Ferdinand, Campbell came on as a substitute in England's group match against Sweden, which made him the first player to represent England on the pitch at six consecutive international tournaments.[94] After Eriksson's resignation, new coach Steve McClaren chose to look elsewhere for central defensive strength and Campbell was dropped for his first match in charge against Greece in August 2006.\n\nAfter injuries to Ledley King, Jonathan Woodgate and Michael Dawson, along with Jamie Carragher retiring from international football, Campbell was recalled to the national team.[95] He played four matches under McClaren as England's qualification campaign failed.[96]\n\nNew head coach Fabio Capello did not select Campbell for his first squad in January 2008. Campbell enjoyed a fine run of form on his return to Arsenal and had retained hope of making it to England's squad for the 2010 World Cup, which would have been his fourth outing on the world stage along with a record seventh major tournament for his country.[97] However, he was not named in Capello's 30-man preliminary squad, with the coach opting instead for Carragher and King among others as potential defensive cover for Ferdinand and Terry.\n\nRegarded as one of the best English centre backs of his generation, Campbell was a strong, athletic and imposing defender, with a good positional sense, and was also a strong tackler. Due to his height and physical power, he excelled in the air, both offensively and defensively, although he initially had to work hard to improve his heading ability during his teenage years.[98][99][100][101][102][103][104] He did not possess good natural stamina, but had pace, power, agility and quick feet, as well as significant mental strength.[99][100][101][105] Due to his versatility and range of skills, as well as his ability to carry the ball out of defence and get forward, he was also capable of playing as a right back on occasion. However, despite being fairly comfortable in possession, he frequently drew criticism throughout his career for his poor distribution.[102][106][107]\n\nOn 30 January 2017, Campbell was named as Dennis Lawrence's assistant manager, after the latter was appointed manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team.[108]\n\nCampbell was appointed manager of Macclesfield Town on 27 November 2018, then bottom of League Two and five points adrift of safety.[109] Under Campbell, Macclesfield finished 22nd in League Two, three points above the bottom two relegation places. They stayed up on the last day of the season with a 1\u20131 draw with Cambridge United.[110] He oversaw eight wins and 12 draws in his 30 games in charge.[111] It was announced on 15 August 2019 that Campbell would be leaving the financially troubled club, by mutual agreement.[112] In December 2019, Campbell backed a HM Revenue and Customs bid to wind-up the club, claiming to be owed \u00a3180,000.[113]\n\nOn 22 October 2019, Campbell was appointed manager of EFL League One club Southend United.[114] Campbell watched his new side lose 7\u20131 to Doncaster Rovers[115] before taking charge for his first game \u2014 a 3\u20131 home defeat to Ipswich Town.[116] On 18 January 2020, Southend won their second game under Campbell with a 2\u20131 victory away at Accrington Stanley, the club's first league win since September 2019.[117] However, financial constraints prevented Campbell from signing any new players during the January 2020 transfer window.[118] In June 2020, the season was ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England. At the time Southend were second from bottom in League One, 16 points from safety. Following a decision not to restart the season, Southend were relegated to League Two.[119] Campbell left the club on 30 June 2020.[120]\n\nAfter his retirement from football, Campbell became increasingly vocal about British politics. In 2013, he said he liked \"the mentality of Labour but the policies of the Conservatives\".[121] In 2014, he criticised Ed Miliband's proposals for a mansion tax on properties worth over \u00a32\u00a0million, calling it \"madness\".[122] He has also stated he is considering joining the Conservative Party and would be interested in helping the party gain more of \"the black vote\".[123]\n\nCampbell has criticised the racial diversity in The Football Association (\"FA\"), and he made newspaper headlines in March 2014 after claiming that institutional racism on the part of the FA meant he was never chosen to captain the England team during his playing career.[124] Campbell had been named as starting captain for England in a friendly against the United States in May 2005 under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson,[125] he was replaced with Zat Knight at half-time following an ankle injury.[126]\n\nIn February 2015, Campbell confirmed his intention to run for the Conservative Party nomination for Mayor of London in the 2016 election.[127] In the list of four candidates chosen in July 2015, Campbell was not shortlisted.[128]\n\nDuring the 2016 referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of, or leave, the European Union, Campbell supported Brexit.[129]\n\nIn 2008, Campbell began dating interior designer Fiona Barratt, the granddaughter of Barratt Homes founder Sir Lawrie Barratt. They married in Corbridge, Northumberland, on 17 July 2010.[130] He has a son from a previous relationship with Janet Tyler.[131]\n\nCampbell had homes in London and at Hallington Hall at Hallington in Northumberland.[132] In December 2015, Hallington Hall was put up for sale for just under \u00a36\u00a0million after being totally renovated.[133]\n\nIn 2009, Campbell launched his charity \"Kids go live\" which allows inner city children to see a variety of live sporting events such as Wimbledon, the Olympic Games and rugby internationals.[134]\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nArsenal\n\nPortsmouth\n\nEngland U19\n\nEngland U21\n\nIndividual\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Campbell"}, {"id": 77, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3371/67415737/original/67415737-photo-u87392138?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Reza Haghighi", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/reza-haghighi/67415737", "desc": "Reza Haghighi is an Iranian footballer who currently plays for Fajr Sepasi in Iran's Premier Football League.", "full_desc": "\n\nReza Haghighi (Persian: \u0631\u0636\u0627 \u062d\u0642\u06cc\u0642\u06cc, born 1 February 1989[4]) is an Iranian footballer who last season played as a defender for Shahrdari Mahshahr.\n\nHaghighi started his career with Payam. He made his debut for Payam on 10 November 2006 while he has 16 years old.[5]\n\nHe joined Fajr Sepasi in the summer of 2009.[6] He was chosen by Mahmoud Yavari as the club Captain before the starting of the 12th Iran Pro League.[7][8] As of August 2012, he was named the Asian Best player of month by Goal.com Asia.[9]\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Persepolis tried to acquire Haghighi but Fajr Sepasi rejected Persepolis's undisclosed bid (reported \u20ac220,000)[10] and he had to stay at Fajr Sepasi.[11] Ultimately, during the mid-season transfer window of the 12th Iran Pro League, the two teams reached an agreement on his transfer terms and Haghighi joined Persepolis on November 21, 2012. He signed a 2.5 year contract until the end of the 2014\u201315 season.[12][13] He made his debut for Persepolis in a 6\u20130 win against Malavan in the 2012\u201313 Hazfi Cup Round of 32.[14] He scored his first goal for Persepolis from a penalty kick in a match against Saipa on 28 February 2013.[15] On December 27, 2014 he was officially released from Persepolis.[16] He finished his career in Persepolis with 61 appearances and 3 goals.\n\nHaghighi joined Padideh in December 2014 with a contract until the end of season.[17]\n\nHaghighi joined Saba Qom in the summer of 2015 with a two\u2013year contract.

He is the current manager of Spanish team Barcelona Atl\u00e8tic. Nicknamed El K\u00e1iser,[2] he is regarded as the best defender in Mexico's history and one of the best Mexican players of all time.[3][4][5]\n\nM\u00e1rquez began his career with Atlas in 1996, playing in over 70 games with the club before moving to France in 1999 with Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title. In 2003, M\u00e1rquez transferred to Barcelona, becoming the first ever Mexican to represent the club. He would go on to play in over 200 games during seven seasons with the Blaugrana, winning numerous championships. In 2006, he became the first Mexican player to win the UEFA Champions League when Barcelona defeated Arsenal in the final. In 2010, M\u00e1rquez joined the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer. After being released from the club in 2012, he moved back to Mexico, this time to play for Le\u00f3n,[6] captaining the team to back-to-back Liga MX titles in 2013 and 2014. M\u00e1rquez then transferred to Hellas Verona of the Italian Serie A.[7] He returned to boyhood club Atlas in 2015, and announced his retirement from football in April 2018.\n\nM\u00e1rquez is the third most-capped player in the history of the Mexico national football team, earning 147 caps throughout his career. In 2018, he became only the fourth player to play for his national team in five consecutive editions of the FIFA World Cup, alongside compatriot Antonio Carbajal, Lothar Matth\u00e4us, and Gianluigi Buffon, appearing in the 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018 tournaments.[8] He is also the Mexican player with the most World Cup matches played with 19.[9] With the national team, M\u00e1rquez won the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2003 and 2011 editions of the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nM\u00e1rquez began his career with Atlas, for whom he debuted in October 1996 at only 17 years of age. M\u00e1rquez rose to prominence while with Atlas, making 77 appearances for the team and being runner-up in the league, losing the final against Toluca on penalties during the Verano 1999 tournament.[10]\n\nAfter playing the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica with Mexico, M\u00e1rquez joined French club AS Monaco for a reported US$6 million.[11] He made his debut on 14 August against Bastia. In his first season, Monaco won the league title, with M\u00e1rquez being named in the Ligue 1 team of the season. He went on to play in 109 matches with Monaco over four seasons, winning the Coupe de la Ligue as well.[12]\n\nIn the summer of 2003, M\u00e1rquez signed for Spanish club Barcelona.[13] He made his debut in La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla, the match ending in a 1\u20131 draw. On 9 November, he scored his first goal for Barcelona in their 2\u20131 victory over Real Betis.[14] In his first season with Barcelona, M\u00e1rquez made 22 league appearances (31 across all competitions) as the team finished second in the league, five points behind Valencia.\n\nDuring his second season, he was moved from his natural position as a centre back to a defensive midfield role, due to injuries to players Thiago Motta, Edm\u00edlson and Gerard. That year, Barcelona won its 17th league title on 14 May 2005 after a 1\u20131 tie with Levante. A month after an injury to his left knee, M\u00e1rquez returned to play against A.C. Milan in the first leg of the 2006 UEFA Champions League semi-final. Barcelona, playing away at the San Siro, won 1\u20130. On 17 May, Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League after defeating Arsenal 2\u20131 in the final, with M\u00e1rquez playing the entire match. He became the first Mexican to play in a Champions League final and the first to win it.[3] Following his participation with Mexico at the 2006 World Cup, M\u00e1rquez signed a four-year contract extension with Barcelona, with the buy-out clause set at \u20ac100 million.[15]\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, M\u00e1rquez formed a partnership with new signing Gabriel Milito while captain Carles Puyol was out injured. Constant injuries, however, threw off his form. M\u00e1rquez's success declined with the rest of the season, leading Barcelona to end up in third place in La Liga after a miserable second half where injuries lead to his contribution being negligible. Even so, new coach Pep Guardiola continued to rely on his contributions; with the departure of Ronaldinho, M\u00e1rquez had become the last original signing of the Frank Rijkaard era to remain on the team. In October 2007, M\u00e1rquez was included in the list of players nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, the only player from the CONCACAF to be nominated.[16]\n\nM\u00e1rquez was Guardiola's first-choice at centre back along with captain Puyol for the 2008\u201309 season. On 13 December 2008, M\u00e1rquez played his 200th match for Barcelona in their 2\u20130 win against Real Madrid.[17] On 28 April 2009, during Barcelona's 2008\u201309 Champions League semi-final match against Chelsea, M\u00e1rquez sustained a knee injury which required surgery, meaning he would miss the remainder of the season.[18] Barcelona would go on to complete a historic treble after winning the Champions League final 2\u20130 against Manchester United.\n\nPrior to the 2009\u201310 season, M\u00e1rquez received an offer from Italian Serie A club Fiorentina.[19] M\u00e1rquez, however, said he wanted to end his career at Barcelona.[20] M\u00e1rquez eventually signed a new contract with Bar\u00e7a in November 2009 that would keep him at the club until 2012.[21] On 20 February 2010, he scored his first goal since his return against Racing Santander.\n\nOn 31 July 2010, M\u00e1rquez was released from his contract by Barcelona.[22] During his time with the club, he played in 242 matches and scored 13 goals, making him the most-capped non-European player in the club's history and the eighth-most capped foreigner.[23] In his 12-year European career, M\u00e1rquez appeared in 46 UEFA Champions League matches, which was the most by a Mexican or CONCACAF player,[24] until compatriot Javier Hern\u00e1ndez surpassed that record in 2017.[25] At the time, M\u00e1rquez was also one of two players from CONCACAF to play in a Champions League final, the other being Trinidad and Tobago's Dwight Yorke for Manchester United in 1999.[24]\n\nAfter seven years with and being released by Barcelona and participating at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, it was reported that Italian club Juventus were interested in signing M\u00e1rquez as a back-up for defender Leonardo Bonucci.[26]\n\nOn 1 August 2010, it was announced that M\u00e1rquez had signed with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer on a three-and-a-half-year contract.[27] He was the club's third Designated Player and was unveiled to the media at Red Bull Arena on 3 August wearing the number 4 jersey and reuniting with former Barcelona teammate Thierry Henry. On 8 August, M\u00e1rquez made his MLS debut against the Chicago Fire in a scoreless draw. On 21 August, M\u00e1rquez scored his first goal, an astonishing shot with his right foot, for the Red Bulls in a 4\u20131 win at Toronto FC. On 21 October, M\u00e1rquez started for the Red Bulls in a 2\u20130 victory over New England Revolution which clinched the regular season Eastern Conference title.[28]\n\nNew York released M\u00e1rquez on 13 December 2012.[29] His stint in New York was heavily criticized by many fans and journalists for his constant injuries, suspensions and perceived lack of commitment to the fans and club.[5][30][31] M\u00e1rquez later revealed in an interview with ESPN Deportes that going to play in the United States was \"a bad decision\" and called it the worst decision he ever made in his career. He said that he had misjudged the arc of his career, believing it was declining faster than it was, and that he regretted declining offers from various European clubs, including one from Italian side Juventus.[5][32]\n\nHours after being released by the New York Red Bulls, it was announced that M\u00e1rquez signed with Le\u00f3n, returning to his home country after 13 years abroad.[33] It would not be until 5 October 2013 that M\u00e1rquez scored his first goal for Le\u00f3n in the Liga MX against Puebla, scoring a penalty kick in the 17th minute.\n\nOn 15 December, Le\u00f3n captured the Apertura 2013 title after defeating Am\u00e9rica 5\u20131 on aggregate.[34] M\u00e1rquez, the club captain, played in both legs as he lifted his first league title in Mexico, more than 14 years after losing the final against Toluca when he played in Atlas.[35] The following tournament, M\u00e1rquez helped Le\u00f3n capture their second straight league title, becoming only the second team in history to win consecutive league titles in the short tournament era, the first being UNAM, who won the Clausura 2004 and Apertura 2004.[36] He also became the first Mexican footballer to win league titles in three countries.[3]\n\nOn 7 August 2014, Hellas Verona of Serie A signed M\u00e1rquez on undisclosed terms.[37] He stated that he had taken a pay cut to join the club as he was desperate to return to Europe.[38] He made his debut in the league on 31 August, starting as Verona played out a goalless draw at home against Atalanta.[39]\n\nOn 21 December 2015, it was announced that M\u00e1rquez had officially transferred to Atlas, returning to the club he debuted with.[40] He was handed the number 4 shirt.\n\nOn 19 April 2018, M\u00e1rquez announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He did, however, state his intention of representing Mexico at the World Cup.[41] M\u00e1rquez played his final match at the Estadio Jalisco on 20 April, a 1\u20130 victory in the Cl\u00e1sico Tapat\u00edo against Guadalajara. The following week, M\u00e1rquez played his final club match against Pachuca at the Estadio Hidalgo, which ended in a 0\u20130 draw.[42]\n\nM\u00e1rquez made his debut with Mexico on 5 February 1997 in a friendly match against Ecuador. It was reported that his call-up was due to an error made by national team coach Bora Milutinovi\u0107, who wanted to call up fellow Atlas player C\u00e9sar M\u00e1rquez.[43] M\u00e1rquez became a regular call-up for Mexico, although he was not chosen for the 1998 FIFA World Cup squad. M\u00e1rquez played various tournaments with the national team, winning the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup and losing to Canada at the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup. M\u00e1rquez started all four of Mexico's games during the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, where he was given the captain's armband by then coach Javier Aguirre despite his young age of 23. He received a red card during Mexico's second round 2\u20130 loss to the United States for a deliberate mid-air head butt on Cobi Jones in the final minutes of the match.\n\nM\u00e1rquez was selected by Ricardo La Volpe for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. M\u00e1rquez played in all of three of Mexico's opening round matches, and scored the lone Mexican goal in a 2\u20131 loss to Argentina in the second round off a P\u00e1vel Pardo free kick which was headed to the far post by Mario M\u00e9ndez, allowing an unmarked M\u00e1rquez to strike the ball into the back of the net. The winner was scored by Maxi Rodr\u00edguez in extra time after Hern\u00e1n Crespo had equalised for Argentina.[44]\n\nNew Mexico coach Hugo S\u00e1nchez called-up M\u00e1rquez to participate in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica. M\u00e1rquez joined up with the team Mexico for the Gold Cup's championship game against the United States after the conclusion of 2006\u201307 La Liga; he started the match, which Mexico lost 2\u20131.[45]\n\nM\u00e1rquez captained Mexico at the 2010 World Cup, scoring Mexico's goal in the tournament's opening match against South Africa which ended in a 1\u20131 draw.[46] In Mexico's 2\u20130 win against France, M\u00e1rquez assisted Javier Hern\u00e1ndez in Mexico's first goal.[47]\n\nOn 29 March 2011, M\u00e1rquez became the eighth player in history to reach 100 caps for Mexico in a friendly match against Venezuela, where Mexico drew 1\u20131.[48]\n\nDuring Mexico's opening match at the 2014 World Cup \u2013 a 1\u20130 win over Cameroon \u2013 M\u00e1rquez became the first player to captain a team in four World Cups.[5] On 23 June, he scored the opening goal in the 3\u20131 win against Croatia, thus advancing to the knockout stage.[49] This goal made M\u00e1rquez the first Mexican player to score in three consecutive World Cups, and the second Mexican player ever to score in three World Cups after Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco.[50]\n\nIn May 2015, it was announced M\u00e1rquez was included in the 23-man squad that would participate in the Copa Am\u00e9rica tournament in Chile.[51] He was selected to start as captain in Mexico's opening fixture of the tournament, a 0\u20130 draw with Bolivia in Vi\u00f1a del Mar.[52] The following year, M\u00e1rquez captained Mexico at the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario, scoring in their opening game a 3\u20131 victory over Uruguay.[53]\n\nOn 11 November 2016, in a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Columbus, Ohio, M\u00e1rquez scored the winning goal for Mexico in the 89th minute to seal a 2\u20131 victory over the United States.\n\nAppearing in Mexico's second group-stage match against New Zealand at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup, M\u00e1rquez \u2013  at 38 years and four months \u2013 became the second-oldest player to appear in a match in Confederations Cup history. He was also making his first appearance at the tournament since 2005, setting new record for most years between consecutive matches with twelve.[54]\n\nOn 4 June 2018, Marquez was named in Mexico's final 23-man squad for the World Cup.[55] This meant he would travel to his fifth World Cup finals, becoming only the fourth player in history to do so, alongside German Lothar Matth\u00e4us, Italian Gianluigi Buffon and fellow Mexican Antonio Carbajal.[56] He was substituted in for Andr\u00e9s Guardado at the 74th minute in Mexico's 1\u20130 win over defending-champions Germany, and became the third man in history to play at a fifth World Cup.[57] On 2 July, in Mexico's round of 16 match against Brazil, M\u00e1rquez became the first player ever to play as a captain in five World Cups and was substituted off at half-time, marking his last appearance as a professional.[58]\n\nOn 8 April 2020, M\u00e1rquez was appointed youth coach at RSD Alcal\u00e1, taking care of the Cadete A (under 15) squad for the 2020\u201321 season.[59][60]\n\nOn 14 July 2022, M\u00e1rquez was appointed coach of FC Barcelona B, signing a two-year contract.[61]\n\nFollowing his retirement, he was introduced as Atlas' new sporting president, succeeding Fabricio Bassa.[62][63] He held the position until May 2019.[64] In October 2021, M\u00e1rquez joined the TUDN network as an analyst and commentator for national team games.[65]\n\nCapable of playing as a centre-back, sweeper, or defensive midfielder,[22] M\u00e1rquez is widely considered one of Mexico's greatest-ever players.[3][4][5] Nicknamed the \"Kaiser of Michoacan\" he has been described as elegant on the ball, dependable in the air and skillful coming out of defense. He also stood out for his leadership, as well as his passing range, and his ability to read the game and intercept the ball.[66][67][68][69][70][71]\n\nAlthough considered one of the best Mexican footballers of all time, M\u00e1rquez is also seen as a controversial figure in the Mexican media for his indiscipline during crucial matches with Mexico.[66]\n\nM\u00e1rquez's father, Rafael M\u00e1rquez Esqueda, was also a professional football player in Mexico. Rafael married Mexican actress Adriana Lavat in December 2001 and had two children, Santiago Rafael and Rafaela, before separating in 2007 and divorcing.[72] He is now married to Jaydy Michel, ex-wife of singer Alejandro Sanz.[73] His younger cousin, Luis Alberto M\u00e1rquez, is also a professional footballer. Luis was formed in Atlas' rival club, Guadalajara[74] and also played for Zacatepec.[75]\n\nOn 9 August 2017, it was reported that M\u00e1rquez was among 22 people sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the \"Kingpin Act\") by the United States Treasury Department for alleged ties to a drug trafficking organization allegedly headed by Ra\u00fal Flores Hern\u00e1ndez,[76] a suspected drug trafficker with links to the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.[77] He was placed on a Specially Designated Nationals List by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Nine businesses, including a soccer school and charitable foundation, were linked to M\u00e1rquez by the OFAC. All 22 people were accused of providing support to, or being under the control of Flores Hern\u00e1ndez.[78]\n\nAccording to the OFAC, M\u00e1rquez conducted money laundering by acting as a strawperson for Flores Hern\u00e1ndez and his criminal organization. They alleged that M\u00e1rquez used businessmen Mauricio Heredia Horner and Marco Antonio Fregoso Gonz\u00e1lez to act for or on his behalf. M\u00e1rquez's assets \"that are under U.S. jurisdiction or are in the control of U.S. persons\" would be frozen.[77][78] The Mexican Attorney General's Office said in a statement that M\u00e1rquez came voluntarily to their offices to provide a statement that same day.[79] Since September 22, 2021 he has been removed from the list and is now clear of his name from the U.S. Treasury Department.[80]\n\nAppearances and goals by national team and year\n\nSources:[81]\n\nInternational goals\n\nMonaco[84]\n\nBarcelona[84]\n\nLe\u00f3n[84]\n\nMexico[84]\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_M%C3%A1rquez"}, {"id": 80, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Yann Soloy", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/yann-soloy/34387417", "desc": "Yann Soloy (born February 15, 1970 in Dieppe) is a retired French professional football player.\nSoloy joined Scottish club Motherwell in December 2001.

He was a pundit for BBC Sport football shows including Football Focus and The Football League Show, until 2014 when he became both manager and a director at newly formed Salisbury.[3]\n\nClaridge's career was known for its longevity and diversity. Born in Portsmouth, he has spent a number of periods with teams from Hampshire and Dorset, having begun his career with non-league Fareham Town in 1983. After failing to gain a permanent contract at local league club AFC Bournemouth, Claridge spent three years at Weymouth, in his longest single spell with any club. From 1988 till 1996 Claridge played for a number of Football League teams, before moving to Leicester City with whom he played in the Premier League and won the 1997 Football League Cup. In 1998, he moved to Portsmouth, where he was also player manager from 2000 to 2001. After a spell with Millwall, he dropped down to the Southern Premier League to work as player-manager for Weymouth. After this ended in 2004, Claridge played for ten different clubs in a variety of leagues, never spending more than a season with one team. He has played at all levels of English football and has also appeared in 1000 professional or semi-professional football matches.\n\nAfter formally retiring from football in 2007, Claridge moved into media work for the BBC. His experience of the Football League has been used to position him as an expert at that level, though he works across a variety of different football programmes on the BBC. After retirement he occasionally played semi-professional football for clubs in south England, most recently in 2017 for Salisbury.\n\nClaridge was born in Portsmouth and grew up in Titchfield, a village near Fareham, and attended Brookfield Community School in Sarisbury Green.[citation needed] He was an adopted child.[4]\n\nClaridge initially played for Fareham Town in the Southern League. He got into Football League side AFC Bournemouth, though Claridge again stepped down the leagues after just seven games for Bournemouth to sign for Weymouth.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 1988 Claridge moved to Crystal Palace for a brief period before opting to join Fourth Division team Aldershot for the 1988\u201389 season. He spent two years with the club before signing with Cambridge United for \u00a375,000. He moved with Cambridge up into the Second Division and stayed with the club for most of the next four years. His tempestuous relationship with manager John Beck, which was exacerbated by Claridge's gambling problems,[5] eventually led to his being sold to Luton Town for only \u00a3120,000 in March 1992. With Luton in financial difficulties however he was sold back to Cambridge, for a club record \u00a3195,000 just five months later (Beck having left the club by this time).[5]\n\nIn January 1994 Claridge moved to Birmingham City for \u00a3350,000. the following season, he became the first player since Trevor Francis to score 20 goals in a season for Birmingham, a performance that earned him the club's Player of the Year award.[6] Claridge was transferred to Leicester City for \u00a31.2\u00a0million in March 1996. It was with Leicester that Claridge reached the Premiership, scoring winning goals in both the 1996 play-off final that gave Leicester promotion and in the 1997 League Cup final replay. In 1997 his autobiography Tales From The Boot Camps, co-written with Ian Ridley, was first published.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1998 Claridge joined hometown club Portsmouth on loan and, following a brief period at Wolverhampton Wanderers, signed for Portsmouth on a permanent basis. From 2000 this was as player-manager, though Claridge's reign lasted for just 25 games before he was demoted. After a period on loan with Millwall, he moved to the London club on a free transfer in 2001. He spent two seasons with Millwall before returning to Weymouth as the club's new player-manager. Weymouth just missed out on promotion to the Football Conference. Following Ian Ridley's resignation as chairman, Claridge also left to return to league football.[citation needed]\n\nIn his later playing career, chronologically, Claridge played for Brighton and Hove Albion, Brentford, Wycombe Wanderers, Gillingham, Bradford City and Walsall. In the summer of 2005 he was appointed as manager of Millwall, but following board-room changes he was relieved of his duties after just 36 days, before his team had played any competitive matches. His replacement was Colin Lee. The decision to dismiss Claridge was taken by new chairman Theo Paphitis,[7] who stated that \"there was a very big chance we could get relegated\" under his management.[8] Millwall were indeed relegated from the Championship that season.[citation needed]\n\nAt the start of the 2006\u201307 season Claridge was without a club, having made 999 career appearances.[9] Eventually, in December 2006, he re-signed for Bournemouth for a month on a pay-as-you-play basis.[10] His 1,000th first-team match was a 4\u20130 defeat to Port Vale on 9 December, at the age of 40.[11]\n\nHe played a one-off match for Isthmian League Premier Division club Worthing on 16 January 2007, a 1\u20131 draw with AFC Wimbledon.[12] Two weeks later, Claridge joined divisional rivals Harrow Borough, for whom he scored on debut in a 4\u20134 draw with Margate.[13]\n\nIn September 2009, Claridge came out of retirement to play unpaid for his former club, the Conference South side Weymouth, who were in severe financial difficulties.[14][15]\n\nClaridge came out of retirement once more in October 2011 when he signed for Gosport Borough of the Southern League Division One South & West as player-coach.[16] He scored the only goal of his Gosport debut, in the FA Trophy against Southern League side Sholing;[17] his first league goal came a week later in a 2\u20131 defeat of Mangotsfield United.[18] Gosport were promoted to the Southern League Premier Division courtesy of Claridge's two goals in the play-off final against Poole Town on 7 May 2012. Having been losing 1\u20130, Claridge scored an equaliser in the first minute of injury time to send the tie to extra time, and completed a 3\u20131 win in the 98th minute to help Gosport return to the Premier Division after a 22-year absence.[19] Immediately after the game he claimed it was \"more than likely [his] last game\",[20] but later admitted he was considering playing for a further season following Gosport's promotion.[21]\n\nThe 51-year-old Claridge made up the numbers for Salisbury in a pre-season friendly against Portsmouth in July 2017; Salisbury lost 3\u20130.[22] On 15 August, he named himself as one of only four substitutes and came on for what the Salisbury Journal dubbed \"a short cameo\" in a Southern League Division One South & West match against Paulton Rovers that ended as a 2\u20132 draw.[23] He started Salisbury's next match, a 3\u20132 FA Cup victory over Fareham Town, substituting himself off after 71 minutes because of broken bones that decided his retirement from playing.[24][25][26]\n\nDuring Claridge's time at Weymouth, he and Ian Ridley, who was club chairman at the time, were two of the subjects of a BBC documentary called Football Stories; Claridge left Weymouth to work in the media, initially for BBC Radio 5 Live. He works for the BBC mainly on The Football League Show, and stated his opposition to the use of goal-line technology.[citation needed] He also has contributed scouting reports to The Guardian.[27]\n\nIn June 2008, Claridge was convicted of dangerous driving and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, suspended for two years, after speeding at 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) in \"treacherous\" conditions. He already had nine points on his driving licence.[28]\n\nBirmingham City\n\nLeicester City\n\nMillwall\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Claridge"}, {"id": 85, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "John Fashanu", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/john-fashanu/1306504", "desc": "John Fashanu (, born 18 September 1962) is an English television presenter and former professional footballer of Nigerian (paternal) and Guyanese (maternal) descent.

He was also capped twice at senior level by England. Over his entire playing career, he also played for Norwich City, Miramar Rangers, Lincoln City, Crystal Palace, Millwall and Aston Villa. He scored 134 league goals in a career lasting 17 years.\n\nFollowing his football career, he went on to co-host British television show Gladiators in the 1990s, and between 2003 and 2004 he managed his own Sunday league football side Fash FC on Bravo.\n\nFashanu was born in Kensington, London, the son of Pearl Gopal, a nurse from British Guiana and Patrick Fashanu, a Nigerian barrister living in the UK. When his parents split up he was sent, together with his older brother Justin, to a Barnardo's care home. When he was five, he and his brother were fostered by Alf and Betty Jackson and were subsequently brought up in Shropham near Attleborough, Norfolk.\n\nFashanu's footballing career began at Norwich City in 1979, and he turned professional two years later \u2013 just as his brother Justin was transferred to Nottingham Forest from the relegated Carrow Road club.\n\nNorwich were promoted straight back to the First Division in 1981\u201382, but Fashanu managed just five league appearances and scored once. He managed two appearances in the 1982\u201383 First Division campaign \u2013 which would be his last for the club. He was never a regular player at Carrow Road.\n\nHe had a brief loan spell with Crystal Palace from Norwich. He also played in the English off-season in New Zealand with Miramar Rangers, and made an appearance in the final of the local equivalent of the FA Cup, the Chatham Cup (he remains the only player to have played in the final of both the English and New Zealand major cup competitions).\n\nHaving failed to win a regular place in Norwich\u2019s first team, he joined Lincoln City on a free transfer on 23 September 1983, when they were in the Third Division. He scored seven goals from 26 league games that season, and managed four from 10 league games the following campaign before his \u00a355,000 transfer to Third Division promotion challengers Millwall on 30 November 1984. In his first season at The Den Fashanu scored four goals in 25 games helping the Lions reach the FA Cup quarter-finals (where they lost at Luton Town in a game marred by fans who invaded the pitch) and secure promotion to the Second Division. He managed eight goals from 25 games in 1985\u201386, before leaving to join Wimbledon towards the end of the Second Division season.\n\nFashanu made a \u00a3125,000 move to Second Division promotion contenders Wimbledon in March 1986, when they were pushing for a third promotion in four seasons as they looked to complete a rapid rise from the Fourth Division to the First. At the time, he was the club's record signing.[3]\n\nFashanu's four goals from the remaining nine league games helped Wimbledon seal the final promotion place and they were a First Division side a mere nine years after being elected to the Football League - and also became only the second club in Football League history to be promoted three divisions in four seasons.\n\nFashanu and his colleagues settled well into the First Division, surprising all the observers by finishing sixth in the league (briefly topping the table in early September) and finishing above traditional big clubs including Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. Fashanu was Wimbledon's top scorer with 11 league goals, and would be a regular goalscorer in the top flight for the Dons for a further seven seasons.\n\nIn 1988, Fashanu helped Wimbledon win the FA Cup, beating Liverpool in a final that was billed as a \"rags versus riches\" affair, although the two clubs were separated by just six places in the First Division - as Liverpool had been the dominant side in English football for some 15 years whereas Wimbledon had played just two seasons in the First Division and only 11 as a Football League club. He performed well in the league again, scoring 14 goals.\n\nHe also scored Wimbledon's goal as Liverpool defeated them 2\u20131 in that year's Charity Shield. Fashanu claimed two England caps \u2013 against Chile and Scotland in a friendly tournament in May 1989, but did not score.\n\nDuring his time at Wimbledon, Fashanu scored 126 goals. His best season was 1990\u201391, when he was the First Division's second highest scorer with 20 goals as his side finished seventh.\n\nHe received criticism during the 1993\u201394 season when a clash with Gary Mabbutt, then Spurs captain, in an aerial challenge left the Spurs defender with a broken skull and eye socket.[4] Fashanu had already established a reputation by that point of being a very aggressive and physical striker, and this was seen as another example of that behaviour. At that time synonymous with Wimbledon's \"Crazy Gang\" which had built up a reputation for this style of play, also exhibited by the likes of Vinnie Jones and Dennis Wise.[4]\n\nOn 4 August 1994, just before the start of the 1994\u201395 season, Fashanu was sold to Aston Villa for \u00a31.35million. However, injury restricted him to just 13 games and 3 goals for a Villa side who narrowly avoided relegation that season. He managed a goal on his Villa debut when they drew 2\u20132 at Everton on the opening day of the Premier League season, his other two goals coming in successive games against Queens Park Rangers and then Nottingham Forest in January.[5]\n\nFashanu's last game was on 4 February 1995 away at Manchester United in a Premiership game that they lost 1\u20130. In a tackle with Ryan Giggs he snapped his knee ligaments and was stretchered off.[6] After the end of the season, Fashanu retired as a result of this injury.[7]\n\nIn 1995, he hit the front pages as well as the back when The Sun published allegations of match fixing against Fashanu, fellow Wimbledon player Hans Segers and Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar.[8][9] All three players were eventually cleared of the allegations in a subsequent court case in August 1997.[10]\n\nFashanu represented England at full International level gaining two caps \u2013 against Chile and Scotland in the 1989 Rous Cup, due to his good form at club level for his then club Wimbledon. He was also eligible to play for Nigeria and since retiring he has expressed regret in not being able to do so.[11]\n\nFollowing retirement from the game through injury, Fashanu became a television presenter. He presented the UK edition of Gladiators alongside Ulrika Jonsson in the 1990s. In 2003, he came second in the second series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!. Later that year he presented Fash's Football Challenge, a reality television show that followed Fashanu managing an amateur football team. Also in 2003, he fronted a six-part series for ITV1 based on the American format Man vs. Beast, however following protests from animal rights groups, the series was never broadcast. He also released a video \"Focus on Fitness with Fash\". He is now host of Deal or No Deal Nigeria, airing on M-Net Africa.\n\nSince retirement Fashanu has also maintained his sporting connections, becoming involved with the Nigeria Football Association, and as chairman of Welsh football team Barry Town for one year, vacating this post in 2003.\n\nIn 2000, he also compiled, all with an investigator, a report on corruption in Nigeria in the 1980s and 1990s that came to be known as the Fashanu Report.[12] In 2003, he became the manager of his own Sunday league football team Fash FC as part of a television reality show.[13]1\n\nIn September 2005 Wimbledon Old Players' Association was launched. John is involved in the Wimbledon Old Players' Association, an organisation set up by the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association. He said: \"It's going to be great to be back as part of the Wimbledon family. As an ex-Wimbledon player, I know all about the heroics of the likes of Roy Law and Dickie Guy in the old days, as well as what the new boys have been doing at AFC Wimbledon\".\n\nIn 2007, The Times named him 22nd out of the 50 worst footballers to have played in the Premier League.[14]\n\nIn August 2009, Fashanu, who in 2000[15] accused Bob Minton and Ibrahim Babangida of stealing money from Nigeria, apologised saying \"I can say it again and again, that there was nothing like debt buy-back or any billions stacked away in any account anywhere.\"[16] Minton said that Fashanu was given false information by the Church of Scientology to attack him.[12][17][18]\n\nIn January 2023, Fashanu was a contestant on the fifteenth series of Dancing on Ice. He was paired with Alexandra Schauman and was first to be eliminated.\n\nFashanu, who was the younger brother of Justin Fashanu, disowned his brother after the latter came out as gay, telling The Voice that Justin was \"an outcast\".[19] After Justin took his own life in 1998, Fashanu expressed remorse for abandoning his brother.[20] However, in an interview with TalkSPORT in 2012, John Fashanu claimed his brother was not gay and was merely an attention seeker.[21]\n\nFashanu has two sons, Amir and Akio, and two daughters, Alana and Amal.\n\nFashanu has been married three times, according to a documentary on football culture made by his daughter Amal. He met his first wife, a Spaniard, when they were both 18. That marriage broke up when Amal was two years old.[22]\n\nFashanu holds a black belt in Karate.[23]\n\nWimbledon\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fashanu"}, {"id": 86, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/41/816705/original/816705-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Darren Byfield", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/darren-byfield/816705", "desc": "Darren Asherton Byfield (born 29 September 1976) is a former professional footballer.

He moved on to Doncaster Rovers in July 2008, before linking up with Oldham Athletic in August 2009, having played on loan at the club during the previous season. His stay at Oldham lasted only a handful of games, after which he returned to Walsall. He left the Football League in June 2011 following an injury-hit 2010\u201311 campaign. He joined non-league Solihull Moors for a brief spell in March 2012, before moving on to AFC Telford United six months later. He joined Tamworth in January 2013.\n\nByfield started his career at Aston Villa, and graduated through the club's Academy to make his Premier League debut on 28 December 1997, in a 1\u20131 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road. Given his debut by outgoing boss Brian Little, he rarely featured under new \"Villans\" manager John Gregory. He made six further substitute appearances in 1997\u201398.\n\nHe appeared in the UEFA Cup in a 3\u20132 win over Norwegian outfit Str\u00f8msgodset IF at Villa Park on 15 September 1998. Byfield was loaned out to Preston North End in November 1998, and scored on his debut at Deepdale on 7 November, in a 4\u20131 win over Burnley. He played four further Second Division games for David Moyes's \"Lilywhites\", and did not feature in the latter half of the 1998\u201399 season.\n\nHe joined Northampton Town on a six-week loan in August 1999, and scored twice in seven games for the \"Cobblers\". After the departure of manager Ian Atkins, Kevin Wilson led the Sixfields outfit to promotion out of the Third Division. Byfield meanwhile joined Cambridge United on loan immediately after leaving Northampton, and featured four times at the Abbey Stadium under manager Roy McFarland. In March 2000 he joined Blackpool on loan, in his third such move of the 1999\u20132000 campaign. He played three Second Division games for Steve McMahon's \"Seasiders\", in a brief stay at Bloomfield Road.\n\nIn June 2000, Byfield signed with Ray Graydon's Second Division side Walsall. He hit 11 goals in 51 games in 2000\u201301, and scored the winning goal in the 109th minute of the play-off final, giving the \"Saddlers\" a 3\u20132 victory over Reading.[3] He scored four goals in 37 First Division games in 2001\u201302, and left the Bescot Stadium soon after Colin Lee was appointed as manager.\n\nIn March 2002, he joined Rotherham United in a \u00a350,000 deal.[4] He got off to a flying start to his Millmoor career, hitting two goals in three games at the back end of the 2001\u201302 campaign. He scored 13 goals in 38 games in 2002\u201303, and told the media that \"Even if the manager (Ronnie Moore) brought in Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer it wouldn't bother me, I am very confident in my own abilities.\"[5] His tally included four goals against Millwall on 10 August in a \"stunning display\" on the opening day of the season when the Millers ran out 6-0 victors at The Den, for which Byfiel was awarded Man of the Match by the home team's fans.[6] He went on to bag eight goals in 33 appearances for the \"Millers\" in 2003\u201304.\n\nAfter Rotherham rejected a bid from Derby County, he signed with Sunderland in February 2004, after the two clubs agreed to a trade for Michael Proctor.[7] Byfield scored five goals in 17 games for Mick McCarthy's \"Black Cats\" in the latter half of the 2003\u201304 campaign, before departing the Stadium of Light at the end of the season.\n\nByfield signed a two-year contract with Championship club Gillingham in July 2004,[8] after rejecting offers from former clubs Preston and Walsall.[9] He hit just six goals in 39 appearances in 2004\u201305, despite maintaining an excellent work rate.[10] The club suffered relegation into League One, as well as a merry-go-round of managers, with Andy Hessenthaler making way for Stan Ternent, who was in turn replaced by Neale Cooper and then Ronnie Jepson. Byfield told the press that his teammates should take the blame for Neale Cooper's departure in November 2005, and should be \"ashamed\" of their performances.[11] Byfield scored 14 goals during the 2005\u201306 campaign, becoming the club's top-scorer, despite spending two months on the sidelines nursing a knee injury.[12]\n\nHe joined Millwall in June 2006,[13] despite manager Ronnie Jepson's best efforts to keep him at Priestfield.[14] Byfield later claimed he was not offered a new contract by the \"Gills\", something which chairman Paul Scally denied.[15] Scally had previously accused Southend United manager Steve Tilson of making an illegal approach for Byfield.[16] Having scored a hat-trick at the start of the month,[17] he was nominated for the League One player of the month award for January, but lost out to Bristol City's Enoch Showunmi.[18] Despite missing the end of the campaign due to an ankle injury,[19] he scored 16 goals in 31 League One games in 2006\u201307 to become the club's top-scorer. However, he seemed keen to move away from The Den, and did not appear in pre-season friendlies or photo opportunities.[20] \"Lions\" boss Willie Donachie had previously rejected an offer of \u00a3165,000 from Brighton & Hove Albion chairman Dick Knight.[21]\n\nByfield was signed by Bristol City for an undisclosed fee (in the region of \u00a3250,000) in August 2007.[22] The Ashton Gate club exceeded all expectations in 2007\u201308, and top-scorer Byfield's eight goals helped them to secure a place in the Championship play-offs.[23] However, the play-off final ended in defeat to Hull City at Wembley; Byfield was a late substitute for Nick Carle.[24] In May 2008, Byfield was released by the \"Robins\",[25] having struggled to secure a place in Gary Johnson's starting eleven after proving himself to be something of a \"super-sub\".[26]\n\nIn July 2008, he joined Doncaster Rovers on a two-year deal.[27] On 14 November, he joined Oldham Athletic on a one-month loan,[28] which was later extended until January 2009.[29] His \"Latics\" debut came in a 1\u20130 win over Northampton Town.[30] Manager John Sheridan described Byfield's performance as \"excellent\", and stated that \"he caused them a lot of problems with his pace and his touch\".[31] The only goal of his eight-game spell came on Boxing Day against Crewe Alexandra; he scored the opening goal in a 3\u20130 victory at the Alexandra Stadium.[32] He returned to the Keepmoat Stadium at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, though sat out the end of the campaign after undergoing a hernia operation.[33] He was released from his contract by manager Sean O'Driscoll on 7 May, having failed to find the net in 16 appearances for \"Donny\".[34]\n\nOn 6 August 2009, Byfield joined Oldham Athletic on a short-term deal.[35] However, after four appearances with no goals, he left Boundary Park on 25 August.[36] Byfield re-signed with Walsall three days after leaving Oldham \u2013 to the delight of manager Chris Hutchings.[37] He was given a contract lasting until January 2010, with an option to extend it until the end of the 2009\u201310 season.[38] He formed an effective partnership with Troy Deeney,[39] and won praise from coach Mick Kearns.[40] Appointed club captain,[41] he missed much of the 2010\u201311 season due to a knee injury,[42] and was released by new manager Dean Smith in May 2011.[43]\n\nIn March 2012 he signed for Solihull Moors.[44] He featured in two Conference North games before the end of the 2011\u201312 season, in what was a brief stay at Damson Park. He joined League Two side Port Vale on trial in August 2012, and \"proved he could still have something to offer with a busy performance\" during a pre-season friendly with Nantwich Town.[45] The \"Valiants\" were unable to offer him a contract due to financial problems, and Byfield instead signed a six-month deal with Conference club AFC Telford United in September, after manager Andy Sinton needed cover to deal with injuries.[46] He moved on to Conference rivals Tamworth in January 2013, joining on non-contract terms.[47] He scored two goals in 18 games for Dale Belford's \"Lambs\" in the 2012\u201313 season and two goals in 14 games in the 2013\u201314 season, before departing in May 2014 after the club were relegated out of the Conference Premier.[48]\n\nThough born in Birmingham, his Jamaican heritage allowed him to win six caps for Jamaica in 2003. He was a squad member for the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The \"Reggaeboyz\" exited the tournament at the quarter-finals with a 5\u20130 defeat to hosts Mexico.\n\nIn May 2016, Byfield took up his first management position after taking over at Southern Premier Division side Redditch United.[49] He remained registered as a player, making six league appearances during the 2016\u201317 season.[50]\n\nByfield joined Stratford Town as manager in May 2018.[51] However, he left the club in September and was subsequently appointed manager of Walsall Wood in October.[52] In May 2019 he left Walsall Wood to become manager of Alvechurch in May 2019.[53] Byfield returned to Walsall Wood in Jan 2020\n\nHe married pop singer Jamelia in June 2008, before the pair filed for divorce in November 2009.[54] Together they had a daughter, Tiani, on 21 October 2005.[55] During their relationship he was also step-father to Teja, was born in 2001.[56] In contrast to the WAGs stereotype, Jamelia was in fact a much more famous celebrity than Byfield. This led to embarrassment for Byfield when Jamelia became engaged in a public spat with Alex Curran, wife of Steven Gerrard; Curran told OK! magazine that \"[Jamelia will] be glad to know I don't know her boyfriend's name but Steven thinks he's lower than a non-league footballer.\"[57] At the time of the quote Byfield was playing for Millwall F.C. of League One, the third highest tier of English football.\n\n\"It is with regret that Jamelia and Darren Byfield today confirm they are splitting up and getting a divorce. No-one else is involved.

He started his career at hometown club Lille OSC, going on to play for AJ Auxerre, Nantes, with whom he won the Coupe de France twice, and RC Lens. He then moved to England and played for Manchester City, Newcastle United, with whom he won the UEFA Intertoto Cup, Wigan Athletic, and Norwich City. At international level, he made three appearances for France at the 1996 Summer Olympics. He is currently sporting director of his former club, RC Lens.\n\nBorn in Lille,[1] Sibierski began his career at hometown club Lille OSC, where he moved up the ranks and played for four complete seasons in the first team before playing for AJ Auxerre and FC Nantes, where he won the 2000 French Cup, in the final of which Sibierski scored both of Nantes' goals.[2] He then joined RC Lens, and eventually became club captain during his three-year stay.\n\nSibierski moved to Manchester City for a fee of \u00a3700,000 in August 2003,[3] where he scored on his debut against Charlton Athletic.[4]\n\nHe was a regular substitute for the team, having started only eighteen of the thirty-three games he participated in, during an all important first season in which he scored seven goals.\n\nThe 2005\u201306 season saw him fighting for a new contract at the club. Early on in the season he won a place up front due to the injury of Andrew Cole but was soon reverted to the bench. Antoine was subsequently released by the club that summer.\n\nNewcastle United signed Sibierski on 31 August 2006 on a one-year contract, just two hours and twenty minutes before the close of the transfer window.\n\nHe scored on his Newcastle debut in the UEFA cup first round tie against Levadia. His league debut for the club came at West Ham United on 17 September, and he scored his first domestic goal for Newcastle on 7 November against Watford in the League Cup. He scored his first league goal for the club in a 1\u20130 win over Portsmouth. Sibierski then went on to score his second league goal for the Magpies against Reading in a thrilling encounter in which the Magpies went on to win 3\u20132. His goal scoring form at the start of the season proved many doubters wrong, as Sibierski went on to be a key European figure. In Europe, Sibierski made 7 appearances and scored 4 essential goals against Levadia Tallinn, Fenerbah\u00e7e, Celta Vigo and Zulte-Waregem respectively.\n\nHe quickly became a Newcastle favourite and an important member of the first team loved by the Newcastle faithful. Due to injuries on Tyneside, including England striker Michael Owen, Sibierski mainly played as a striker, where his partnership with Nigerian Obafemi Martins proved successful. He also played as an attacking midfielder in a 4\u20135\u20131 formation. He played a part in an exciting 2\u20132 draw with Manchester United, later saying he was disappointed not to get on the scoresheet against his former club's main rivals. He scored his first European goal of 2007 with a brilliant individual effort against Zulte-Waregem in the UEFA Cup on 15 February. Sibierski nut-megged a defender, took it round another, took it round the keeper and tapped home the last goal in a 3\u20131 win.\n\nHowever, Newcastle were not willing to match Sibierski's wish of a new two-year contract at the club, instead offering just another one-year contract, which he rejected. Sibierski's agent Willie McKay stated that whilst negotiations were still ongoing, it looked increasingly likely that Sibierski would be leaving the club as his contract came to an end, especially with newly appointed manager Sam Allardyce bringing fresh ideas and tactics. Following his season with Newcastle, Sibierski described himself as a Newcastle fan. He is affectionately known among Newcastle United fans as 'Sib The Sexist' in homage to Tyneside's Silver Tongued Cavalier 'Sid The Sexist'.[5]\n\nSibierski agreed a two-year deal with Wigan Athletic on a free transfer from Newcastle United on 4 June 2007 along with Titus Bramble, who played at Newcastle with Sibierski the previous season but was also released.[6] He scored on his debut in the 2\u20131 defeat at Everton on 11 August 2007.[7] He followed this up with a second goal for the Latics on his home debut at the JJB Stadium on 15 August against Middlesbrough, and a third for Wigan's third game in a row, completing a 3\u20130 victory over Sunderland on 18 August. Subsequently, Sibierski suffered several injuries and his form slumped, as Wigan slipped from the top 4 to the relegation zone.\n\nHowever, on 12 January 2008, Sibierski scored a crucial winner within seconds of coming off the bench against Derby County with a low drive into the bottom left corner of the net from 25 yards out. He then followed this up with another spectacular goal against Chelsea, in the FA Cup.\n\nOn 1 September 2008, Sibierski joined Norwich City on loan.[8] He scored what proved to be the winning goal on his debut against Plymouth Argyle on 13 September 2008 from a free-kick. However, after this he made little impact and returned to Wigan in January when his loan ended. He was released by Wigan at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, after not being offered a new contract.[9]\n\nSibierski is of Polish descent through his paternal grandfather, who came to France from Poland to work in the mines.[10] He represented France at the 1996 Summer Olympics, making three appearances.[11]\n\nAfter finishing his playing career, Sibierski briefly became a football agent with his brother.[12] He is currently the Sporting Director of Ligue 2 club RC Lens.[13]\n\nFormer Lille teammate Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dindeleux, who had been his friend since the age of eight, was best man at Sibierski's wedding to Isabelle.[14] The couple had three children together: two daughters and a son.[citation needed] Following the unfortunate passing of his 18-year-old elder daughter Sibylle on 1 February 2010, a charity \"Fonds de Dotation Sibylle Sibierski\" has been formed in her name with the support of football legends such as Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, former Arsenal captain and Manchester City midfielder Patrick Viera, Chelsea striker Didier Drogba and Kevin Keegan of England and Newcastle and more.[15][16]\n\nNantes\n\nNewcastle United\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Sibierski"}, {"id": 89, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/42/823202/original/david-ginola-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "David Ginola", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/david-ginola/823202", "desc": "David D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Marc Ginola (French pronunciation: \u200b[david \u0292inola]; born 25 January 1967) is a French former international football player who has also worked as an actor, model and football pundit.\nGinola was born in Gassin, a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region in southeastern France.

He continued playing in the Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa and Everton before retiring in 2002. At international level, he made 17 appearances scoring three goals for the France national team between 1990 and 1995.\n\nSince his retirement from football, he has become involved in football punditry and acting. Ginola is a regular contributor to BBC, BT Sport and CNN. He has hosted Match of ze Day, a program which broadcasts live Premier League matches on Canal+. In January 2015, Ginola attempted to run for the FIFA presidency but withdrew after failing to receive the required backing of at least five national football associations.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\nGinola was born in Gassin, Var.[9]\n\nGinola played at club level for Toulon (1985\u201388), RC Paris (1988\u201390), Brest (1990\u201392), Paris Saint-Germain (1992\u201395), Newcastle United (1995\u201397), Tottenham Hotspur (1997\u20132000), Aston Villa (2000\u20132002) and Everton (2002).\n\nGinola made his first senior appearance for Sporting Toulon as an eighteen-year-old in a 1985 2\u20130 victory away at Metz.[10] He played fourteen times in his first season, and by 1986 he was a regular in the Toulon line-up. In 1988, he moved to RC Paris, where he remained until signing for Brest in 1990. There, he began to impress with his flamboyant style of play. In 1991, he played a crucial role in a landmark victory (3\u20132) against the side who would go on to sign him, Paris Saint-Germain F.C.\n\nGinola joined Paris Saint-Germain in January 1992, at a time when it was pushing for major honours with the financial backing of TV channel Canal+. He quickly adapted to the club and became a fan favourite noted for his elegant first touch and flair. His popularity did not suffer any consequence even when he admitted that he supported Paris Saint-Germain's rivals Olympique Marseille as a boy and that he would have joined them rather than PSG.[11] In his first full season (1992\u201393), Ginola won the Coupe de France (scoring in the final)[12] and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. At the end of 1993, he was also won the French Footballer of the Year award from the France Football magazine.\n\nIn his second full season in 1993\u201394, PSG won the second league title of its history, losing only three times. Alongside Paul Le Guen, Bernard Lama and Antoine Kombouar\u00e9 and coached by Artur Jorge, Ginola provided 13 goals in 38 games, which made him the top club goalscorer.\n\nThe following season, under new manager Luis Fernandez, proved to be less successful in the league, with FC Nantes being crowned champions. Ginola scored 11 times in 28 league appearances. Paris Saint-Germain did shine in the cup competitions though, winning another Coupe de France as well as the first edition of the new Coupe de la Ligue. In the UEFA Champions League, the Parisian club caused a major shock after knocking out 1994's finalists FC Barcelona in the quarter finals, with Ginola playing particularly well. The club was eliminated at the next hurdle by defending champions A.C. Milan.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, Ginola decided to leave France. Known to be a Spanish football enthusiast, he was expected to be snapped up by Barcelona. Furthermore, between 1992 and 1995, his stellar displays in European competitions against the Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona had attracted media attention in Spain, with local media dubbing him \"El Magnifico\".\n\nIn 1995, Ginola joined Newcastle United for \u00a32.5 million. He was signed at a time when manager Kevin Keegan was attempting to turn the club into one of the major forces in English football, and the board was prepared to offer strong financial backing to sign a number of European superstars. Ginola made his debut against Coventry City on 19 August 1995 in a 3\u20130 win. He scored his first league goal on 27 August against Sheffield Wednesday in a 2\u20130 away win, and went on to score five league goals in his first season. In the 1995\u201396, Newcastle finished second, four points behind Manchester United. This was their strongest league performance in decades, and Ginola was an integral part of the team. However, it was a major disappointment that Newcastle had finished second in the Premier League as they had led by up to 10 points as late as January.\n\nIn 1996, Bobby Robson, manager of Barcelona, attempted personally to sign Ginola, but Newcastle refused to allow the transfer.[13] To add to their line-up, Newcastle paid \u00a315m, breaking the transfer record, to sign Alan Shearer. Despite this, Newcastle finished second again, being narrowly overtaken by Manchester United. Halfway through the season, Kevin Keegan suddenly resigned as manager to be succeeded by Kenny Dalglish. Ginola fell out of favour and sought a transfer elsewhere.[14]\n\nTottenham Hotspur signed Ginola in July 1997 for \u00a32.5 million, where he was joined by Newcastle teammate Les Ferdinand. In 1999, he was named PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year,[15] while playing for Tottenham Hotspur. During the 1998\u201399 season, Ginola scored one of his most notable goals, when Spurs played Barnsley in the FA Cup sixth Round. Ginola weaved in and out of a number of Barnsley players and finished in the left side of the net, the only goal of the game. He was the first player in Premiership history to win the award while at a club who finished the season outside of the top four. He also won his only English domestic trophy with Spurs, the 1999 League Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over Leicester City at Wembley Stadium. Ginola is fondly remembered by Spurs fans for his extravagant forward play and personality off the pitch. He played an integral role in their 1999 League Cup win and scoring a long range goal in a 3\u20131 win against Manchester United in a previous round. Ginola was inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 11 December 2008.[16][17]\n\nIn July 2000, Ginola joined Aston Villa for a transfer fee of \u00a33 million. He expressed his disappointment that Tottenham had sold him, saying the news that they had accepted the offer was a \"bombshell\".[18] Villa manager John Gregory challenged Ginola to prove he could still perform in the Premiership, rather than move to a less demanding league abroad, as Ginola was now in his 33rd year and seemed unlikely to continue at professional level for much longer.[19] After being accused by Gregory of being overweight, Ginola celebrated a goal against Manchester City by taking off his jersey to unveil his toned physique.[20]\n\nIn January 2002, he was banned for two matches and fined \u00a322,000 for stamping on an opponent and disputing his dismissal with the fourth official.[21]\n\nIn 2002, Ginola signed for Everton[22] playing five games for the club before retiring in May 2002, just after David Moyes took over as manager. Ginola was deemed surplus to requirements by Moyes, and made only one substitute appearance from March onwards. His contract was not renewed and Ginola, without a club, retired.[23] He announced his intention to move into either acting or football coaching.\n\nAlthough Ginola was a very prominent French player, he did not see much action with the France national team, having been capped only 17 times in his career.[10] In 1987, Ginola played for the France under-21 team at the Toulon Tournament. He was named the tournament's best player after France beat England 4\u20133 in the final.[24]\n\nGinola is infamous in France for his mistake in a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Bulgaria. France needed only a draw in their final group qualifying match on 17 November 1993 to qualify for the finals of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and Ginola had come on as a late substitute for Jean-Pierre Papin. With the score level at 1\u20131 in the last minute of the match, Ginola overhit a cross intended for Eric Cantona. The ball was collected by Emil Kremenliev, who launched a quick Bulgarian counterattack which resulted in Emil Kostadinov scoring the winning goal. Bulgaria thus won the match 2\u20131 and qualified for the 1994 World Cup finals at the expense of France.[25]\n\nIn a television interview aired on 18 November 1993, G\u00e9rard Houllier, the manager of the France team during its entire 1994 World Cup qualifying campaign, blamed France's 2\u20131 defeat by Bulgaria entirely on Ginola and described him as someone who had \"sent an Exocet missile through the heart of French football\" and as the \"assassin of the team\".[26] After being barracked by French fans and branded as the \"assassin of French football\" by the French press, Ginola moved to England, signing for Newcastle United.[27] Houllier's successor Aim\u00e9 Jacquet regularly selected Ginola for international matches, but often used him only as a substitute. Ginola played his last match for the national team in 1995. In April 2012, a French court dismissed Ginola's lawsuit against G\u00e9rard Houllier for alleged defamation. In the book Secrets de coachs (Coaches' Secrets), Houllier was alleged to have made disparaging remarks about Ginola and to have referred to Ginola in offensive terms, blaming him for misplacing the cross that allowed Bulgaria to launch the decisive counterattack and secure the win over France during the final minute of the 1994 World Cup qualifier.[28][29]\n\nAs a winger, Ginola was renowned for his \"magical\" touch on the ball and his ability to get past players from any type of position and then manage to score a goal. His ability to do that was shown in games for Tottenham and Newcastle, with his most memorable goal in Newcastle's 5\u20130 win over Premier League giants Manchester United on 20 October 1996, becoming a flamboyant part of the memorable \"Entertainers\" Newcastle side of his era, which also featured other highly acclaimed players including Alan Shearer, Les Ferdinand, Faustino Asprilla, Peter Beardsley and Keith Gillespie.\n\nIn 1999, Dutch legend Johan Cruyff remarked that it was his belief that Ginola was currently the best player in the world.[30] Despite his talent, however, Paul Merson accused Ginola of diving in order to win fouls throughout his career; he was also notorious for his difficult character and lack of discipline both on and off the pitch, which led him to be involved in confrontations with other players as well as some of his managers. As such, his compatriot Eric Cantona criticised him for his poor mentality, despite his technical ability.[31][32] In 2015, The Daily Telegraph placed Ginola at number 15 in their list of \"The top 20 overrated football players of all time,\" describing him as \"one of the world's best on his day, but unfortunately his day was very infrequent. Ginola's carefree attitude infuriated most of the managers he worked with, which is partly why he never lasted more than three years at any club. Too often Ginola was a luxury player who struggled for consistency.\"[33]\n\nGinola took his first steps towards a career in acting by attending classes at RADA.\n\nGinola made his debut as 'Didier the Butcher', the leading part in the Anglo-French short film Rosbeef. Rosbeef, a tale of love, lust and a kilo of sausages, premiered during the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The same year Rosbeef won a prize, the 'Prix Coup de Coeur Canal+' at the Festival International de Cin\u00e9ma et Gastronomie in Dijon. Next he played the title role, Mr Firecul the devil in the British short film Mr Firecul.\n\nFor his first feature film, The Last Drop, Ginola was cast as 'Corporal Dieter Max', a renegade German sniper alongside the likes of Agathe de la Boulaye, Michael Madsen, Nick Moran, Karel Roden and Billy Zane. This World War II heist movie premiered in Cannes in 2005 and was released as Operation Matchbox.\n\nIn 2000, Ginola made a cameo appearance in the first episode of the ITV drama series At Home with the Braithwaites. In 2003, Ginola played himself, announcing the results for the first Euro Lottery. In 2004, he played the leading role in The Centre, a BBC television documentary and in 2006 he appeared in the second series of Channel 4's Coach Trip during episode 22, in which he acted as a tour guide of Sainte-Maxime. Later that year Ginola appeared, again as himself, in the ITV series City Lights.\nIn 2008, Ginola appeared in an episode of Chop Shop on Discovery Turbo where he had a one-off car designed for his son's birthday and in the same year he appeared as Alexandre, a fashion photographer, in the special edition of the CBS series The Young and the Restless, shot in Paris to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the show's broadcast in France where it is known as Les Feux de l'amour.\n\nBefore moving to England, Ginola had already transcended the world of football by featuring in advertising campaigns for the Morgan clothing company and appearing on the catwalk for Cerruti.\n\nIn England, he fronted commercials for a.o. Braun shavers, Carte Noire coffee, Kingston Technologies memory sticks, Ladbrokes sports betting, L'Or\u00e9al hair products and Renault cars.[34]\n\nGinola has featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of FIFA 97.[35]\n\nGinola was an ambassador for the Paris 2012 Olympic bid and was also an ambassador for the French Golf Federation in their successful bid to stage the Ryder Cup 2018 in France. \nGinola campaigned worldwide for the English FA bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[citation needed]\n\nHe is a campaigner for the Red Cross Anti-Landmine campaign and Unesco and was respectively patron and president of the UK based Vision and Sparks charities.[citation needed]\n\nOn 16 January 2015, Ginola announced that he would be running for the presidency of FIFA for which he was paid a \u00a3250,000 fee by the Irish bookmaker Paddy Power. He would attempt to raise \u00a32.3 million to fund the campaign for the FIFA presidency through contributions via a crowdfunding program. He started his campaign on the same day by denouncing the credibility of Sepp Blatter\u2019s FIFA before admitting he knew little about the governing body's processes or institutions. The elections to select the next FIFA president would be due on 29 May 2015. Ginola withdrew his candidacy on 29 January, the deadline for candidates to formally submit their nominations, after failing to secure the support of at least five national football associations.[36][37]\n\nGinola worked as a football pundit with the BBC, BT Sport, Canal Plus, CNN, Sky Sports and Talksport.[38]\n\nIn 2008, Ginola received a silver medal at the International Wine Challenge for a ros\u00e9 wine produced at his vineyard in Provence.[39]\n\nGinola was one of the contestants in the first season of Danse avec les stars (a French version of the British TV show Strictly Come Dancing). In 2021, he was announced as a contestant on the twenty-first series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in the United Kingdom. He ultimately ended in 4th.[40]\n\nGinola married fashion model Coraline in 1991. The couple have a son and a daughter, Andrea and Carla; they lived near Saint-Tropez. They split and Ginola entered a relationship with model Maeva Denat,[41][42] with whom he has a child.[43]\n\nOn the afternoon of 19 May 2016, Ginola was playing a charity football match at the home of Jean-St\u00e9phane Camerini (the organiser of the Mapauto Golf Cup) in Mandelieu-la-Napoule in the southeast of France when he suddenly collapsed due to cardiac arrest and then fell into a coma. He was administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the pitch by fellow footballer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mendy. Minutes later, a team of medics who had arrived in an ambulance used a defibrillator on him; it took five shocks from the machine to restore normal heart rhythm within 10 minutes. Ginola was airlifted minutes later by a helicopter to the Cardiothoracic Center of Monaco 40\u00a0km northeast of Mandelieu, where he underwent an immediate, six-hour, operation. Professor Gilles Dreyfus, who operated on Ginola, said that were it not for Mendy who administered CPR on him he would be dead, or have suffered permanent brain damage. Dreyfus said that Ginola had \"very complicated coronary lesions \" which required the quadruple heart bypass operation to be performed. The morning after being admitted to the hospital, Ginola woke up \"perfectly normally\" with no neurological damage and was \"recovering well.\"[44][45][46] Prof Dreyfus said Ginola was \"very lucky to be alive\". On 30 May 2016, Ginola was discharged from hospital and returned home, thanking people on Twitter for their \"incredible messages of love and affection\".[47]\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nAston Villa\n\nFrance U21\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ginola"}, {"id": 90, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/2144/42874625/original/john-veitch-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "John Veitch", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/john-veitch/42874625", "desc": "John Gould Veitch (19 July 1869 \u2013 3 October 1914) was an English amateur footballer, who played for the Corinthian club in the 1890s.

He made one appearance for England playing at inside left in 1894, in which he scored a hat trick.\n\nOutside football, he was a member of the Exeter-based Veitch Nurseries business.\n\nVeitch was born in Kingston Hill, Surrey, the son of John Gould Veitch and his wife, Jane (n\u00e9e Hodge). His father was a horticulturist, one of a long line of renowned plant collectors and breeders. His elder brother James Herbert Veitch became a partner and subsequently owner of the Veitch Nurseries business.\n\nVeitch was educated at Westminster School and was a member of the school football side in 1887. He then went up to Cambridge University (Trinity College), where he won a blue in 1888, 1889, 1890 and 1891.[2][3]\n\nOn leaving university, he continued to play for Old Westminsters, although he was also a member of the Corinthian amateur club, having made his first appearance for them while still at university on 26 January 1889 in a 1\u20130 defeat by Preston North End.[4] His next appearance was on 16 February when he scored in a 3\u20131 victory over Scottish Cup finalists, Celtic.\n\nOver the next few years, his appearances for Corinthian were fairly infrequent, until after he had left university. In the 1891\u201392 season, he played in thirteen of Corinthian's 16 fixtures, scoring twelve goals, including a hat-trick against Scottish side Renton on 18 April 1892.[4] In the following season he only played nine matches for Cornthian, and would also make a solitary appearance for Slough against Wolverton in a 6-1 defeat,[5] but in 1893\u201394 he made 17 Corinthian appearances scoring ten goals. In the match against Derby County on 27 March 1894, he scored four goals as Corinthian ran out 5\u20133 winners.[6]\n\nFor the match against Wales at Wrexham on 12 March 1894, the England selectors decided to field a team consisting entirely of players with Corinthian connections, including three players making their international d\u00e9but. Lewis Vaughan Lodge (Cambridge University) made the first of five appearances at right back; Arthur Topham (Casuals) made his solitary England appearance at left half while the third d\u00e9butante was John Veitch who played at inside left, alongside his fellow Old Westminster Rupert Sandilands.[7]\n\nWales opened the scoring after 10 minutes, but by half-time England had taken the lead with a goal from Veitch and an own goal from Charlie Parry. Veitch scored again early in the second half and completed his hat-trick in the 80th minute, thus joining a select band to score a hat-trick on his d\u00e9but. The fifth goal came from Robert Cunliffe Gosling as England ran out comfortable 5\u20131 victors.[7][8] Veitch is one of five players to have scored a hat-trick on his England debut, yet not make a second appearance.[9]\n\nVeitch started the 1894\u201395 season with seven goals in the opening three matches, but he was then only able to make the occasional appearance, with his final match for Corinthian coming on 13 April 1898, when he appeared at full-back. In his nine years with Corinthian, he scored 49 goals in 69 appearances.[10]\n\nHe joined the family horticulture business as company secretary. He did not enjoy good health for long as he had weak lungs and suffered from premature deafness.[11] Following the death of his brother, James in 1907, John succeeded to the Chelsea, London business. He did not, however, have the ability to run the business successfully, and his uncle Sir Harry Veitch returned to take over control. Following John's death in October 1914 at the age of 45, Sir Harry closed the business.\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Veitch_(footballer)"}, {"id": 91, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/38/755490/original/colin-hendry-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Colin Hendry", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/colin-hendry/755490", "desc": "Edward Colin James Hendry (born 7 December 1965) is a Scottish football player and coach.

He earned 51 caps for Scotland, scoring three times and was part of the Tartan Army's Euro 96 and World Cup 98 squads.\n\nFollowing on from retirement, Hendry took over as  Blackpool manager and later had a spell in charge of Clyde. He later returned to Blackburn as part of their coaching staff having previously had a spell as assistant manager of Boston United.\n\nHendry first played for his local semi-professional club, Highland League outfit Keith, and Islavale, a North Scottish Junior club. He began his full-time professional career in 1983 with Dundee. During his early career, Hendry played mainly as a striker. In 1987 he was transferred to Blackburn Rovers, where he was converted into a defender. One of his first appearances came in the Full Members Cup final, where he scored the only goal in the 1\u20130 Wembley win over Charlton Athletic.\n\nHe played over 100 games for Blackburn before joining Manchester City in 1989, where he was named Player of the Year in the 1989\u201390 season. His days at City were numbered, however, after he fell out of manager Peter Reid's plans when Reid took over in November 1990 on the departure of Howard Kendall to Everton.\n\nHe was re-signed for Blackburn by Kenny Dalglish in November 1991 for a fee of \u00a3700,000[4] and helped them to great success including promotion from the Second Division and winning the FA Premier League. In 1998, he got a move back to Scotland to play with Rangers where he was signed by manager Dick Advocaat for \u00a34\u00a0million. However, despite winning the domestic treble in his first season, his time there was relatively unhappy with Advocaat claiming that Hendry was \"not his type of player\". After his spell at Rangers, Hendry also played for Coventry City and Bolton Wanderers, as well as Preston North End and Blackpool on loan, before retiring from playing football.\n\nOverall, Hendry played more than 500 league games and scored more than 40 goals in a playing career spanning 20 years.\n\nIn November 2018, Hendry played a league game for Blackburn Sunday League side Moorgate F.C.[5]\n\nHendry managed to win 51 caps for Scotland despite the fact that he was a latecomer to the international scene, not making his debut until he was 27. He captained Scotland in the 1998 World Cup. His last Scotland appearance, on 28 March 2001, saw Hendry score two goals in a 4\u20130 win over San Marino.[6] His international career was ended as he was subsequently banned for six matches for elbowing San Marino substitute Nicola Albani later in that game.[6]\n\nHendry landed his first managerial job in June 2004 when he was appointed manager of his former club Blackpool, but was dismissed by the club in November 2005 following a poor run of results.\n\nIn September 2006 Hendry joined Boston United as assistant manager, and in June 2007 he became manager of Scottish side Clyde.[7] Hendry lost his first three games in charge. He picked up his first victory in a Scottish Challenge Cup tie against fellow Scottish First Division side Queen of the South in August 2007. His best run was a six-game undefeated streak from November 2007 to December 2007. His final game in charge of Clyde was a Scottish Cup fourth-round match, which Clyde lost 1\u20130 to Dundee United.[8] Hendry resigned as manager of Clyde on 18 January 2008,[8]\n\nIn June 2012, Hendry re-joined Blackburn Rovers, initially as first team coach.[9] He later became assistant manager of the club's under-21 team.\n\nOn 12 June 2014, Hendry left Rovers.[10]\n\nHendry's wife, Denise, died on 10 July 2009, aged 43.[11] Her death was caused by complications during an operation that was needed following cosmetic surgery performed in April 2002.[11] Hendry has four children by his wife: Rheagan, Kyle, Callum and Niamh.[12] His son Callum is also a footballer.[13]\n\nOn 23 June 2010, Hendry was formally declared bankrupt at Blackpool County Court.

In 1987, he moved to Manchester United, with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three Premier League titles, three FA Cups, one League Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to the Double. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the England national team. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.\n\nBruce began his managerial career with Sheffield United, and spent short periods of time managing Huddersfield Town, Wigan Athletic and Crystal Palace before joining Birmingham City in 2001.

They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it's in-bred, you follow the club still the same today.\"[8] Like several other future professionals from the area,[9] he played football for Wallsend Boys Club.[8] He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from that team who were selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.[10]\n\nHaving been turned down by several professional clubs, including Newcastle United, Sunderland, Derby County and Southport, Bruce was about to start work as an apprentice plumber at the Swan Hunter dockyard when he was offered a trial by Third Division club Gillingham, whose manager Gerry Summers had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament.[11] He travelled down to Kent with another player from the Wallsend club, Peter Beardsley, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away.[12] At the time Bruce was playing as a midfielder, but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, Bill Collins, whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.[12][13]\n\nBruce spent the 1978\u201379 season in Gillingham's reserve team and, despite playing in defence, scored 18\u00a0goals to finish the season as top scorer.[14] In January 1979, he was selected to represent the England youth team, and he went on to gain eight caps, participating in the 1980 UEFA European Under-18 Championship.[15] He came close to making his debut for the club's senior team in May 1979, but Summers decided at the last minute that, as Gillingham were chasing promotion from the Third Division, Bruce was not yet ready to handle the pressure of the occasion.[16] He eventually made his senior debut in a League Cup tie against Luton Town on 11 August 1979,[17] and made an immediate impact in the team, winning the club's Player of the Year award at the end of the 1979\u201380 season.[18] He went on to make more than 200\u00a0appearances for the club,[14] and was twice voted into the Professional Footballers' Association's Third Division Team of the Year.[19]\n\nConfident that he was being targeted by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired at the end of the 1983\u201384 season.[20] In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months.[21] He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs.[12] Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken.[22] Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as \u00a3125,000[23] or \u00a3135,000.[14] In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.[24]\n\nBruce began the 1984\u201385 season by scoring an own goal in the first minute of his debut for Norwich against Liverpool,[25] but went on to score the team's winning goal in the semi-final of the League Cup against local rivals Ipswich Town,[26] and was named man of the match in Norwich's victory in the final.[27] Bruce was voted Norwich City Player of the Season, but the team was relegated to the Second Division.[28][29] Bruce played in every match as Norwich won promotion back to the top division at the first time of asking in the 1985\u201386 season,[28][30] after which he was chosen to replace the departing Dave Watson as club captain.[31] The following season he helped the club to its highest ever league finish of fifth position.[32]\n\nIn 1987, he was chosen to captain the England B team in a match against the full national team of Malta,[33] but it was to be his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described as one of the best defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team.[34][35][36] Bruce later stated, \"I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came up to me and said 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one.\"[37]\n\nBruce began to attract the attention of big-name clubs in late 1987, with Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Rangers all reported to be interested in signing him.[38] Manchester United quickly emerged as the front runners for his signature, and Bruce publicly expressed his desire to sign for the club.[39] The deal came close to collapsing when Norwich asked for a transfer fee of \u00a3900,000 after initially agreeing to accept \u00a3800,000,[40] leading to Bruce refusing to play any further matches for the club, which he felt was jeopardising his dream move.[41] On 17 December 1987, shortly before his 27th birthday, the deal was concluded and Bruce officially left Carrow Road,[40][42] for a fee reported as \u00a3800,000[23] or \u00a3825,000.[9] Norwich fans remembered his contribution, and in 2002 voted him into the Norwich City Hall of Fame.[43]\n\nBruce made his Manchester United debut in a 2\u20131 win over Portsmouth on 19 December 1987,[44] and played in 21 of United's remaining 22\u00a0league fixtures,[45] helping the club to a top-two place in the First Division for the first time since 1980.[46] The team only finished in mid-table in the following season,[47] prompting manager Alex Ferguson to bring in several new players, including Gary Pallister, who joined the club in August 1989 from Middlesbrough.[48] His partnership with Bruce in the centre of defence was described in 2006 by the then-United captain, Gary Neville, as the best in the club's history.[49] \"Dolly and Daisy\", as the pair were affectionately known, are described as \"arguably the best\" on the official Manchester United website.[50] Bruce and Pallister were part of the team that won the 1990 FA Cup Final against Crystal Palace in a replay.[51]\n\nFollowing the lifting of the five-year ban on English clubs from European competitions, which had been imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster, United became England's first entrants into the European Cup Winners' Cup in the 1990\u201391 season.[52] Bruce played regularly, and scored three goals, in the team's progress to the final against FC Barcelona.[53] He came close to scoring the first goal, only for Mark Hughes to deflect the ball over the line and claim the goal,[54] and United went on to win the game 2\u20131. This was a particularly high-scoring season for Bruce, who found the net 13\u00a0times in the First Division and 19\u00a0times in total in all competitions.[53] He also played again at Wembley, in the League Cup final, in which United were defeated by Sheffield Wednesday of the Second Division.[55]\n\nBruce missed several weeks of the 1991\u201392 season when he underwent an operation on a longstanding hernia problem,[56] in which Leeds United, after a season-long tussle, beat Manchester United to the championship by four points.[57] Bruce helped United win their first-ever League Cup in April 1992,[58] captaining the team in the final in place of the injured Bryan Robson.[59] Injuries continued to take their toll upon Robson during the 1992\u201393 season, leading to Bruce captaining the team in the majority of United's matches during the first season of the new Premier League.[37] Bruce scored two late goals in a win over Sheffield Wednesday which proved decisive in United winning the inaugural Premier League title,[60] the first time the club had won the championship of English football since 1967, and he and Robson received the trophy jointly after the home victory over Blackburn Rovers on 3 May.[61]\n\nAt the height of his success with United, Bruce was contacted by Jack Charlton, manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland. Bruce states in his autobiography that further investigation revealed that, while his earlier appearance for England B in a friendly was not an issue, his appearances for the England Youth team in a UEFA-sanctioned tournament prohibited him from playing for the senior team of another country.[62] He has subsequently claimed that he chose not to play for Ireland as it would have caused problems for his club at a time when UEFA restricted the number of foreign players that a club could have in their squad in its competitions.[4]\n\nUnited dominated English football in the 1993\u201394 season, winning a second consecutive Premier League title and then defeating Chelsea in the FA Cup final to become only the fourth team, and Bruce the first English captain, to win the Double in the 20th century,[63][64][65] The 1994\u201395 season was a disappointing one for Bruce and United, as the club failed in its bid to win a third consecutive Premier League title and lost to Everton in the FA Cup final.[66]\n\nDuring the following season Bruce was offered the job of manager by three clubs, but Ferguson refused to allow him to pursue the opportunities as he felt the player still had a role to play in the United team.[67] Bruce made a further 30\u00a0Premier League appearances,[44] as United managed to overcome a 12-point deficit to Newcastle United to win the championship once again.[68] A week later he was left out of United's squad for the FA Cup final due to a slight injury.[69] At the end of the match Eric Cantona, who had captained the team and scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over Liverpool, attempted to persuade Bruce to be the one to receive the trophy, but Bruce declined.[70] Ferguson denied that Bruce's omission was a sign that his time at the club was nearing an end,[71] but Bruce opted to join First Division club Birmingham City on a free transfer, having signed a contract valued at nearly \u00a32\u00a0million over two years, which made him one of the highest-paid players in the country.[71]\n\nBruce was among five former Premier League players signed by Birmingham manager Trevor Francis to add experience to a squad expected to challenge for promotion.[72] He was made captain of the team,[73] but his Birmingham career was dogged by a series of disagreements with Francis.[74] Director David Sullivan felt the need to publicly deny rumours that Bruce was lined up to replace Francis as manager after the club's stock market flotation.[75][76] While playing for Birmingham, Bruce was the subject of several bids from his old Manchester United colleague Bryan Robson to sign for Middlesbrough, but the transfer never happened.[77]\n\nThe 1997\u201398 season saw Bruce being left out more frequently, and his omission against Nottingham Forest provoked a public war of words, which fuelled rumours that the manager was to be dismissed and that Bruce would take over as caretaker until the end of the season.[78][79] At the end of the season he accepted the post of player-manager of Sheffield United. Though the deal was delayed while Birmingham attempted to negotiate a transfer fee for his playing contract,[80] he took up his new position on 2 July 1998.[81] He played 11 matches for the club before retiring as a player, his final appearance being in a home match against Sunderland on 28 November 1998.[82]\n\nDuring the early part of his career, Bruce's sometimes over-enthusiastic playing style, which he later described as \"rampaging\",[12] caused him disciplinary problems. He later developed into a solid and dependable all-round player, characterised as \"an honest trier who made the absolute most of limited natural ability\".[83] In his prime, he was particularly noted for his calm and deliberate passing of the ball, and his ability to control it under pressure, often with his chest. At the time, Mark Wright of Liverpool was said to be the only other centre-back able to match Bruce's level of skill in these areas.[56]\n\nBruce was also known for his unusually high goalscoring rate for a centre-back, resulting from a combination of his ability to powerfully head the ball and his effectiveness in taking penalty kicks.[84] Although lacking poise and grace,[83] and often criticised for his lack of pace,[83][85] his bravery and willingness to take knocks from opposition players made him the \"heart\" of the defence during his time with Manchester United.[86] He was well known for continuing to play even when injured,[83][87] including returning to the United team at short notice in 1992 even though he was awaiting an operation on a hernia.[56] His indomitable spirit and motivational abilities were deemed vital to the United team,[83] and Alex Ferguson has commented on his \"determination and heart\".[88]\n\nIn his first season as a manager, Bruce guided Sheffield United to eighth place in the First Division, nine points away from a place in the play-offs.[89] He caused controversy when he attempted to take his team off the pitch during an FA Cup match against Arsenal. Bruce felt that the Gunners had broken an unwritten rule of sportsmanship by scoring the winning goal from a throw-in instead of returning the ball to United, who had intentionally kicked it out of play to allow an injured player to be attended to. Although the game eventually continued to a finish, following a gesture by Arsenal the match was declared void and replayed.[90][91] In May 1999, Bruce resigned from his post after just one season in charge, citing turmoil in the club's boardroom and a shortage of funds for transfers.[92] He contemplated leaving football for a job in television, but was persuaded by Huddersfield Town owner Barry Rubery to become the club's manager.[93]\n\nHuddersfield were early promotion contenders in the 1999\u20132000 season, winning six consecutive matches to rise to third place in the First Division table by late November,[94] but lost form and failed to reach the play-offs.[95] The team continued to struggle at the start of the 2000\u201301 season, gaining just six points from 11 matches, and Bruce was sacked in October 2000.[96] He then became involved in a dispute with Rubery, who accused him of \"wasting\" \u00a33\u00a0million on players and having \"an ego to feed\".[97] Although he was linked with the manager's job at Queens Park Rangers,[98] Bruce remained out of the game until he was appointed manager of Wigan Athletic in April 2001.[99] The team reached the Second Division play-offs but lost in the semi-finals,[100] and Bruce almost immediately left the club, where he had been in charge for less than two months, to take over as manager of Crystal Palace.[101]\n\nAlthough his new club began the 2001\u201302 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that it had last held in the 1997\u201398 season,[102] Bruce tendered his resignation less than three months into the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed.[103][104] By now he had acquired a reputation as a manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.[102]\n\nUpon his arrival, the Blues were in a mid-table position in the First Division,[105] but a lengthy unbeaten run saw the team qualify for the play-offs.[106] The team went on to beat Bruce's former club Norwich City in the final after a penalty shoot-out to gain promotion to the Premier League, ending a 16-year absence from the top level of English football.[107] Birmingham spent the early part of the 2002\u201303 season struggling near the foot of the Premier League table, but Bruce's signing of Christophe Dugarry revitalised the team, who ended the season in 13th place and finished higher than local rivals Aston Villa for the first time since the 1970s.[108]\n\nThe following season began well for Birmingham, who climbed as high as fourth in the table, but the team's fortunes declined and they could only finish in tenth place at the end of the season.[109] Despite this disappointment, Bruce signed a new contract in June 2004 designed to keep him at St Andrew's for a further five years,[110] but just two months later Freddy Shepherd, chairman of Newcastle United, was reported to have made Bruce his main target in the search for a new manager to replace Bobby Robson. The club was reportedly prepared to pay Birmingham more than \u00a33\u00a0million in compensation, and Bruce himself was said to be keen to take over at St James' Park,[111] but he ultimately remained at Birmingham. He stated that \"as far as I'm concerned, I've got a job to do [at Birmingham City] and I'm determined to get on with it\", but it was also reported that Newcastle would have been required to pay a much larger compensation fee or face legal action had he been persuaded to switch clubs.[112] Initial expectations were high for the 2004\u201305 season, but the club once again finished in a mid-table position, ending the season in 12th\u00a0place.[113]\n\nFollowing the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle manager in February 2006, Bruce was again linked with the job,[114] which ultimately went to Glenn Roeder.[115] By this stage of the 2005\u201306 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7\u20130 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals.[116] Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager.[117] The team managed to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time in nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006.[118] However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.[119]\n\nAlthough Bruce had the largest transfer budget in the division made available to him,[120] Birmingham made a slow start to the 2006\u201307 season in the Championship and, after a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Norwich City, the team's fifth consecutive match without a win, there were calls from fans and local journalists for the manager to be sacked.[121][122] Bruce publicly accepted responsibility for the team's poor run and admitted that he feared for his job,[123] but the team responded with a 1\u20130 victory over Derby County,[124] and then recorded a further five consecutive league victories to be joint leaders of the league table by late November.[125][126] On 29 April 2007, Birmingham secured promotion to the Premier League, with one match to play, by virtue of Derby County's 2\u20130 defeat at Crystal Palace. Chairman David Gold told the press \"There have been some dark days but Steve has been outstanding. He was determined to bounce back. He has rebuilt the team and now we are all back where we want to be.\"[127]\n\nIn May 2007, Birmingham's board agreed a new contract for Bruce, but the unwillingness of the club's prospective purchaser Carson Yeung to ratify it left his future uncertain.[128] In October 2007, Bolton Wanderers were refused permission to speak to him about their managerial vacancy.[129]\nLater that month, Bruce and Yeung held a meeting which reportedly had positive results.[130] Bruce later claimed that Birmingham's managing director Karren Brady had \"shafted\" him on a new contract with the club,[131] and when Wigan Athletic requested permission to speak to Bruce about their managerial vacancy, he was receptive to their approach.[132] As required under the terms of his contract, Wigan agreed to pay Birmingham a then-world record compensation for the loss of his services of around \u00a33\u00a0million,[133] and they were then allowed to speak to him. On 19 November, Wigan announced the signing of Bruce for a second time.[134]\n\nOn 21 November, during a press conference which was intended to formally present Bruce as the new manager of Wigan, the club's chief executive Brenda Spencer informed the media that the deal had been put on hold by \"unknown issues\" between Bruce and Birmingham City, reported to centre on the advance payment of the image rights element of Bruce's contract at St Andrew's.[135][136] On 23 November 2007 Wigan announced that Bruce had now signed his contract and would officially rejoin the Latics.[137] His first game in charge was a 1\u20131 home draw with Manchester City on 1 December 2007.[138] Wigan spent the remainder of the season struggling against relegation, but the club secured Premier League survival with victory over Aston Villa in the penultimate game of the season.[139][140] In September 2008, Bruce was once again linked with the manager's job at Newcastle United following the departure of Kevin Keegan.[141]\n\nBruce led Wigan to an 11th-place finish in the 2008\u201309 season,[142] despite the loss of midfielder Wilson Palacios to Tottenham Hotspur in the January transfer window.[143]\n\nOn 27 May 2009, Bruce was reported to have been given permission to talk to Sunderland about succeeding Ricky Sbragia, who resigned as manager after the last match of the season.[144] Bruce was confirmed as the new manager of Sunderland on 3 June after signing a three-year contract.[145] He was joined at Sunderland by three of his former Wigan Athletic coaching staff, assistant Eric Black, goalkeeping coach Nigel Spink, and reserve team coach Keith Bertschin.[146] In his first season at Sunderland, despite a run of 14 games without a win, Bruce led the Black Cats to a 13th-place finish in the Premier League.[147]\n\nBruce made wholesale changes to Sunderland's squad, signing 13 players and selling 15 in his first 18 months at the club.[148] On 25 February 2011, Bruce signed an extension to his contract, keeping him at Sunderland until 2014, with chairman Niall Quinn stating that \"In only 18 months he has reshaped our squad beyond recognition, bringing in some fantastically talented players. He embodies the ethos of teamwork and the importance of camaraderie in creating a wonderful spirit of togetherness amongst the players and staff\".[148]\n\nBruce was dismissed as manager on 30 November 2011, with Sunderland in 16th position following a poor run of form which culminated with a 2\u20131 home defeat to bottom club Wigan four days earlier.[149] He later linked his dismissal from the managerial post with the fact that he is a fan of Newcastle United, Sunderland's bitter rivals.[150]\n\nOn 8 June 2012, Bruce was appointed as manager at Championship club Hull City on a three-year contract.[151] In his first season with the club, he led them to promotion to the Premier League, clinching second place in the Championship on the final day of the season.[152] The following season, the \"Tigers\" came 16th with a club record tally of 37 points,[153] and reached the final of the FA Cup for the first time.[154] They took a two-goal lead in the first ten minutes of the final, but opponents Arsenal scored a goal in each half to take the game into extra-time and then scored a third to win the trophy.[155] Reaching the final qualified Hull for the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League, their first European campaign.[156]\n\nIn March 2015, Bruce signed a three-year contract extension.[157] A run of poor form left Hull near the bottom of the table going into the final game of the 2014\u201315 season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand any chance of avoiding relegation.[158] They could only manage a 0\u20130 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hern\u00e1ndez, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.[159]\n\nIn January 2016, Bruce won the Championship Manager of the Month after leading Hull to four victories; Hern\u00e1ndez, who scored six times, got the players' equivalent.[160] Hull finished the season in fourth, qualifying for the play-offs, where they defeated Derby County in the semi-finals. In the final on 28 May, a 25-yard goal from Mohamed Diam\u00e9 against Sheffield Wednesday won Hull promotion to the Premier League for the second time during Bruce's spell in charge. Bruce said after the game that he had considered resignation following the team's relegation, and would hold talks with the prospective new owners to be assured of his future.[161] In July 2016, with his future at Hull seemingly still uncertain, he was interviewed by officials of The Football Association concerning the vacant position of manager of England.[162] Three days later, Bruce met with Hull City officials and announced his resignation later that day[163] amid claims he became frustrated by a lack of transfer activity at the club.[164]\n\nOn 12 October 2016, Bruce was appointed manager of Championship club Aston Villa.[165] In his second match in charge, Villa defeated Reading, the club's first win in 11 games and the first away win for 14 months.[166] He brought in Colin Calderwood as assistant manager from Brighton & Hove Albion and Stephen Clemence from old club Hull City as first-team coach.[167][168] In the 2017\u201318 season, Villa secured a play-off place and defeated Middlesbrough to reach the final,[169] but lost 1\u20130 to Fulham in the final and thus missed out on promotion to the Premier League.[170] On 2 October 2018, Villa surrendered a two-goal lead, drawing 3\u20133 at home to bottom club Preston North End. One spectator threw a cabbage at Bruce and there were calls from home fans on the Holte End for Bruce to go.[171] The following day, he was sacked by Villa after a poor run of form.[172]\n\nIn January 2019, Bruce was appointed manager of Championship club Sheffield Wednesday with effect from the start of the following month.[173] On 27 January, his delay in taking up this appointment was criticised by Match of the Day pundits Danny Murphy and Ruud Gullit during a 3\u20130 FA Cup defeat away to Chelsea.[174] Bruce subsequently defended his decision, as he had had two operations since leaving Aston Villa and needed time to recuperate, as well as the need to recover from the death of both his parents in 2018.[175]\n\nBBC Sport reported in July 2019 that Bruce had resigned from his position at Wednesday,[176] after he earlier admitted that he had held talks with Premier League Newcastle United over their managerial vacancy.[177] His appointment at Newcastle was confirmed on 17 July.[178] Sheffield Wednesday, however, soon filed a report to the Premier League alleging misconduct in his appointment,[179][180] stating that there were still outstanding legal issues with Bruce having resigned just 48 hours earlier, whilst also suspecting that confidential details of Bruce's contract were leaked making it impossible for him to remain at the club.[181] Newcastle United denied any wrongdoing and stated that they were confident no case could be escalated.[182] Reaction from the fans was mixed, with some feeling Bruce would not achieve the standard set by his predecessor Rafael Ben\u00edtez, whilst his recent lack of Premier League football and management of rival club Sunderland proved controversial.[183][184] Bruce acknowledged Ben\u00edtez's popularity, and stated he hoped the fans would not rush to judgement and give him time to prove himself.[185]  Bruce soon made six signings,[186] notably securing Joelinton from 1899 Hoffenheim for \u00a340\u00a0million, breaking the club's transfer fee record previously set by the purchase of Miguel Almir\u00f3n for \u00a321\u00a0million six months earlier.[187][188]\n\nIn his first season in charge, Newcastle were tipped for relegation by some pundits but finished 13th, as the campaign was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[189] The following season, almost entirely played behind closed doors due to the ongoing pandemic, saw Bruce guide the club to 12th.[190] In October 2021, the club was bought for \u00a3300\u00a0million by a consortium led by the Saudi Arabian government's sovereign wealth fund.[191]  With the team close to the bottom of the Premier League, Bruce was widely expected to be dismissed from his job by the new owners, but remained in charge and was recognised by the League Managers Association as only the 34th manager in the modern era of English football to have taken charge for 1,000 competitive matches.[192] Newcastle lost that match 3\u20132 to Tottenham Hotspur at St James' Park on 17 October 2021, and some Newcastle supporters called for Bruce to be removed from his post during and after the game.[193] Bruce left Newcastle by mutual consent three days later on 20 October 2021, after receiving a reported \u00a38\u00a0million payout for the remainder of his contract.[194] He had a 27.4% win percentage from 84 league games at Newcastle, the 9th best compared to previous Newcastle managers who had been in charge of at least 20 matches in the Premier League era.[194]\n\nOn 3 February 2022, Bruce was appointed manager of EFL Championship club West Bromwich Albion, replacing Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl. Bruce signed an 18-month contract with West Brom who, at the time, were in sixth place in the Championship.[195]  He left the role eight months later with the team 22nd in the division, their lowest league position for more than two decades.[196]\n\nBruce has been married since February 1983 to Janet (n\u00e9e Smith),[197][198][199] who is also from the Hexham area, and went to the same school as Bruce.[7] The couple have two children, Alex (born 1984) and Amy (born 1987).[197] Alex also became a professional footballer, and was signed by his father for Hull City in July 2012.[200] He had previously played under his father's management at Birmingham City, but left the club in 2006, in part due to accusations of nepotism levelled at his father.[201] Amy was linked romantically with Aston Villa player Lee Hendrie in tabloid newspaper stories in 2004, which provoked an angry response from her father, who described the reports as \"lies\", and claimed that journalists had gone so far as to contact his doctor and examine his household waste in an attempt to uncover gossip.[202] In September 2004, Bruce was involved in an altercation outside his home with two men who were attempting to steal his daughter's car. The affray left him with facial injuries but did not prevent him from travelling to a Premier League match the same day.[203] After the incident one newspaper attempted to connect it with the allegations concerning Hendrie, leading Bruce to contemplate legal action.[202]\n\nBruce's autobiography, Heading for Victory, was published in 1994. In 1999, while manager of Huddersfield, he wrote a trio of novels: Striker!, Sweeper! and Defender!. The books centred on fictional football manager Steve Barnes, based on Bruce, who solved murder mysteries and thwarted terrorists. Bruce later expressed his embarrassment at the books, which have become sought-after collectables.[204][205]  He intended to publish a new autobiography in late 2019 but the book was postponed indefinitely due to the deaths of his parents and his desire to concentrate on his job at Newcastle.[206]\n\nNorwich City\n\nManchester United\n\nIndividual\n\nBirmingham City\n\nHull City\n\nIndividual\n\nBibliography\n\nFootnotes\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bruce"}, {"id": 95, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Troy Broadbridge", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/troy-broadbridge/2281977", "desc": "Troy Broadbridge (5 October 1980 \u2013 26 December 2004) was an Australian rules footballer with the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).", "full_desc": "\n\nTroy Broadbridge (5 October 1980 \u2013 26 December 2004) was an Australian rules footballer with the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).\n\nBroadbridge began his career as a defender with South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Port Adelaide, the team his father Wayne played for, and was drafted by the Melbourne Football Club at the beginning of the 2001 AFL season. He won the club's Most Improved Player award in 2001, and became a regular in the side, playing a total of 40 games over his three seasons.\n\nBroadbridge's first and last AFL games were both against Essendon \u2013 he made his debut in Round 8, 2001, in the teams' first meeting since the 2000 Grand Final, while his last league game was also against Essendon, in the 2004 elimination final. On both occasions, Melbourne lost.[1] His final game of football at any level was in the 2004 premiership team of Melbourne's VFL-affiliate, Sandringham.[2]\n\nBroadbridge married Trisha Silvers on 18 December 2004. On 26 December, while spending their honeymoon in the Phi Phi Islands, Thailand, he drowned after being swept out to sea by the tsunami that followed the Indian Ocean earthquake, but Silvers survived. His father located his body in a Thai morgue on 3 January 2005.[3]\n\nTrisha wrote a book about the events, Beyond The Wave, and was named as the 2006 Young Australian of the Year for her volunteer work for various charities, including building a school on Phi Phi named in Troy Broadbridge's honour.[4]\n\nIn Melbourne's first match of the 2005 season, played against Essendon, the Demons all wore black armbands with number 20 sported on them in memory of Broadbridge. The Demons won that game and dedicated the win to him and his widow, Trisha. Broadbridge's number 20 guernsey was retired for the following two seasons (2005\u20132006), and it was revived in 2007 by new player Colin Garland.\n\nSince 2007, the Troy Broadbridge Memorial Trophy has been awarded to any Melbourne-listed player that accumulates the most votes for the club's VFL affiliate.[5]\n\nMelbourne captain Max Gawn paid tribute to Broadbridge, among other deceased club identities, in a post-match interview upon the club winning the 2021 AFL Grand Final.[6]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Broadbridge"}, {"id": 96, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Zolt\u00e1n Szlez\u00e1k", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/zolt\u00e1n-szlez\u00e1k/34419656", "desc": "Zolt\u00e1n Szlez\u00e1k (born 26 December 1967 in Balassagyarmat, Hungary) is a retired Hungarian football player who has spent most of his career playing for \u00dajpest FC.He played as a centre back.

He was also selected six times in the All-Australian Team and represented Australia in the International Rules Series. He was West Coast's club champion for four seasons and captain for five seasons.\n\nCousins' football career was marred by highly publicised off-field incidents involving recreational drug use, traffic convictions and association with criminal elements. On several occasions he was fined or sanctioned by West Coast, culminating in his contract's termination in October 2007.[4] The following month, he was banned from AFL for one year by the AFL Commission for \"bringing the game into disrepute\".[5] Amid predictions that he would remain undrafted, Richmond claimed Cousins with the last pick of the 2008 draft. He played 32 games across two seasons at the club, retiring from the AFL at the end of the 2010 season.\n\nCousins co-produced a documentary film titled Such is Life: The Troubled Times of Ben Cousins, saying he hoped it would serve as a cautionary tale against drug use. Released days after his retirement, it went onto become \"one of the most-watched documentaries in Australian history.\"[6] Post-football, Cousins continued to struggle with his drug addiction and have run-ins with the law, and in 2017 he received a 12-month prison sentence for a variety of offences.\n\nCousins was born in Geelong, Victoria, in 1978, to Stephanie and Bryan, an Australian rules footballer who had moved from Western Australia to play for the Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League. When Cousins was 18 months old, his family moved back to Perth, Western Australia,[7] where he was raised with younger siblings Matthew, Sophie and Melanie. He played junior football for the Bull Creek-Leeming Junior Football Club[8] and for his private school, Wesley College. In his last year at Wesley in 1995, he was recruited to join the East Fremantle Football Club's senior side in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and played for both his school and East Fremantle throughout the season.[7]\n\nWhile Cousins was still at school, three AFL teams competed to draft him under the father\u2013son rule: the Geelong Football Club, the West Coast Eagles, and the newly formed Fremantle Football Club. Cousins' father Bryan played 238 games for Perth in the WAFL and 67 games for Geelong in the VFL during the 1970s and 1980s. Geelong's recruiting manager, Stephen Wells, said, \"Ben barracked for Geelong and we tried everything to get him here.\"[7] However, Cousins preferred to remain based in Western Australia and chose West Coast in October 1995.\n\nAt 17, a week after his tenth WAFL game for East Fremantle, Cousins played his first AFL match and kicked two goals for West Coast against Geelong.[7] He won the Norwich Rising Star award for his debut season in 1996, polling 15 votes from the six judges to beat Shannon Grant by one point.[9]\n\nCousins' popularity continued to increase over the following seasons. In 1998, the Herald Sun ran a two-page article across its centre pages about 20-year-old Cousins, titled \"West goes wild for the kid\". The article portrayed Cousins as a sex symbol and \"football's answer to Brad Pitt\". When asked about the article, he said the popularity \"comes with the territory... If you want to be a league footballer you have to accept that it is part of the game.\"[10] Sports agent Ricky Nixon approached Cousins in 1998 about managing his endorsement deals, because \"He's good-looking, he elected to stay in Perth and not play in Victoria, opposition coaches take notice of him and on top of that he's a future leader.\"[11] In 1999, International Management Group, who managed sports stars such as Tiger Woods and Pete Sampras, said they would like to sign Ben, as \"There is no doubt that he is now in the top bracket of players and has great marketing potential... Apart from being an outstanding footballer, he is a quality young man.\"[12] Ross Nicholas, West Coast's marketing manager, said:[7]\n\n\"He's easily the most sought-after Eagle... No player was, or is, as popular as Ben. His appeal is so diverse. Kids want his autograph and photograph. Sponsors want him to sit next to them. They want him to push their product... If Ben's well managed, the sky's the limit for him... They've got to find the balance between his commercial potential and his contribution to the community. The club offers protection, but it's up to Ben what demands he puts himself under.\"\nIn 1998, Cousins was selected in the All-Australian Team and was runner-up in West Coast's Best and Fairest.[13] He played in his first AFL finals game in 1999, against the Western Bulldogs in a qualifying final at the MCG,[14] and the year included another selection in the All-Australian Team and representing Australia in the International Rules Series.[13] In 2000, Cousins signed a new three-year contract with the West Coast Eagles, reportedly worth nearly A$1\u00a0million.[15]\n\nHe played his 100th game amid speculation he would take over the captaincy from Guy McKenna, who was due to retire after the same game. Cousins said, \"After you play two or three seasons, you think of the possibility of a leadership role down the track, but the talk of it has certainly come a lot earlier than I would have thought.\"[15] In 2001, Cousins was named co-captain, sharing the role with Dean Kemp.[16] He won his first club Best and Fairest at the end of the season, a feat which he repeated in 2002 and 2003,[17] and he was again named in the All-Australian Team in 2001 and 2002.[18] Kemp's retirement saw Cousins become the captain in 2002, a role he filled until 2006. In 2005, West Coast coach John Worsfold said of Cousins' fifth year as captain, \"Ben is improving all the time and with the way this group is coming along, I think he is going to be a great leader\".[19]\n\nIn early 2003, Cousins injured his ankle in a game against Hawthorn but played on through five weeks of pain-killing injections.[20] In Round 15, 2004, he injured his back and missed six games. Cousins said, \"That injury is something that I got over and am probably no chance of getting a relapse... The other side to it is, because I have played 10 years of consistent AFL footy, I've probably got an older back than someone my age\".[20] In Round 1, 2005, he dislocated a finger and missed one round after undergoing an operation.[20] West Coast chief executive Trevor Nesbitt said, \"There's no doubt that he's at his best when under pressure and he's so resilient; he plays with injuries that other players wouldn't\".[20]\n\nAfter Cousins played his 200th game in July 2005 he was given a \"rousing reception from 41,524 grateful fans\",[21] as video clips of his ten years at West Coast were shown at the end of the game. Cousins was \"possibly the highest-profile sportsman in Western Australia\",[20] the youngest of the 10 West Coast players to reach 200 games and the 14th youngest in the history of the AFL/VFL.[20]\n\nCousins won the Brownlow Medal, the AFL's highest individual player award, on 19 September 2005 with 20 votes, ahead of teammate Daniel Kerr on 19 votes and Nick Dal Santo on 18 votes.[22] Cousins was the favourite to win with bookmakers, after five previous top-10 finishes.[22] He did not attend the award ceremony in Melbourne, remaining in Perth to prepare for West Coast's Grand Final match against Sydney Swans the following weekend.[22] His celebration was \"very quiet, I went over to the bar, bought the folks a bottle of champagne, had one lemonade and went up to the (hotel) room. I managed to get to sleep before midnight, which was a bonus.\"[23] West Coast's last training session in Perth before travelling to their first Grand Final game since 1994[22] was attended by 3,000 fans.[23] Trevor Nesbitt, West Coast's chief executive, said he expected that the combination of the team's Grand Final appearance, Cousins' Brownlow win, and Chris Judd's Brownlow win in the previous year, would lead to a turnover of around $2\u00a0million in club merchandise.[24] Nesbitt added:[24]\n\n\"It's quite a special time for the club and it's probably worth $1\u00a0million to WA footy as a minimum I would think... The performances of Chris and Ben assist us in raising more money for WA football and their contribution is just outstanding. They're marquee players and, apart from everything else that happens with them, they are extremely beneficial for all West Australians.\"\nWest Coast lost the 2005 Grand Final to Sydney by four points, but as well as his Brownlow win, Cousins was awarded another West Coast Best and Fairest and the players' Most Valuable Player award, with 159 votes compared to runner-up Matthew Pavlich's 99 votes.[25] He was runner-up to Barry Hall in the coaches' player of the year award,[25] and in statistics, had 612 disposals, 24 goals, and ranked in the top five of the league in nine of the 12 categories.[25]\n\nIn February 2006, Cousins resigned his captaincy after an off-field incident where he fled a booze bus.[26] In May 2006, he signed a new three-year contract with West Coast, and in September 2006, West Coast won the Grand Final, defeating Sydney by one point.[27] Cousins was suspended indefinitely by West Coast on 20 March 2007 after missing two training sessions.[28] It was later confirmed that Cousins had a substance abuse problem.[29]\nAfter returning from four weeks of rehabilitation in Malibu, California, for substance abuse,[27] Cousins was offered an amended contract by West Coast, rumoured to contain strict conditions such as repaying the cost of rehab and undertaking regular drug tests.[30] On 29 June 2007, Cousins was given clearance by the AFL to resume training with the West Coast Eagles, which he did the following Monday.[31] However, he injured a hamstring in training,[32] delaying his comeback until West Coast's home game against Sydney on 21 July at Subiaco Oval. He gained 38 disposals and six marks in the game,[33] inspiring West Coast's win.[34]\n\nOn 16 October 2007, Cousins' car was stopped in Northbridge and searched.  He was arrested for drug possession and refusing to submit to a blood test.  The Eagles sacked him the next day, which meant that he was no longer a registered AFL player.[4] On 19 November, he was banned from playing senior football for 12 months by the AFL Commission for \"bringing the game into disrepute\",[5][35] and was formally delisted by West Coast on 30 November.[36] Eagles officials said that he would never appear in an Eagles guernsey again, and AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou said it would be \"extremely difficult\" for him to ever return to the AFL.[4]\n\nIn November 2008, the AFL Commission cleared Cousins to play AFL football in 2009. The Commission ruled that Cousins must submit to regular drug tests, including urine testing up to three times per week and hair testing up to four times annually.[39] Cousins attended drug testing in early November with no body hair long enough to sample.[40]\n\nSeveral teams showed an interest in drafting Cousins for 2009, including Collingwood Football Club, St Kilda Football Club and Brisbane Lions.[41] Collingwood sent a private investigator to Perth to follow Cousins for several days. After meeting with Victorian Chief Commissioner of Police Christine Nixon in October 2008, Collingwood announced that they would not draft Cousins.[42] In November, after reviewing Cousins and consulting stakeholders for five months, St Kilda said they would not draft him.[43] The day before the national draft, Brisbane issued a media release that said they would not be drafting Cousins.[44] On 29 November 2008, Cousins was not selected in the AFL National Draft.[45]\n\nAhead of the AFL Pre-season Draft in December 2008, Richmond Football Club approached the AFL Commission for approval to move injured senior player Graham Polak to its rookie list in order to obtain a second draft pick in the pre-season draft, which it said it would use to select Cousins.[46] The AFL Commission had given approval to Essendon two years earlier to do similar with Adam Ramanauskas during his battle with cancer. The commission, with the support of the AFLPA and most of the clubs, denied Richmond's request.[47] However, Richmond selected Cousins with its only Pre-season Draft selection (#6 overall) on 16 December.[48] Following this Richmond received an influx of new club members[48] and Cousins trained with the team the following day in front of a crowd of around 2,000.[49] In Richmond's Round 1 game against Carlton on 26 March, Cousins strained his hamstring during the final quarter.[50] He played a game with the Coburg Football Club in the Victorian Football League before returning to the AFL in Round 7 against Brisbane.[51][52]\n\nOn 17 August 2010, after weeks of speculation by the media, Cousins announced his retirement in front of his family and huge crowd. During the speech, he thanked everyone who had assisted him during his career, acknowledged his encounters with drugs and the law, and apologised to his family for the situation he had put them in:[53]\n\nI'll always regret what I've put my family through. There's a lot of shame and regret. People wonder why I haven't broken down or shed a tear (in public). My tears are something that I hold close to me; they're for me and my family.\nIn 1997, Cousins took part in an education campaign for the WA Asthma Foundation. During his first year in the AFL, Cousins said his chest often felt tight and he had difficulty playing, \"but if I monitored my asthma correctly and took the right medication, I was able to overcome those effects\".[55] In 1999, he had a mild asthma attack while warming up for a game against Melbourne, then fainted while at a restaurant after the game. West Coast's football manager, Rod Lester-Smith, said Cousins may have been affected by asthma, low blood pressure from playing the game earlier, and a corked leg that caused some internal bleeding. He was taken to Murdoch Hospital and recovered quickly.[56]\n\nWest Coast coach Ken Judge was told by a Perth detective in 2001 that Cousins and two of his teammates may have been using illegal drugs. Judge passed this information on to the club's administration but no action was taken.[57]\n\nIn September 2002, Cousins punched teammate Daniel Kerr at the club's best and fairest award celebrations, after an argument about Kerr's relationship with Cousins' sister Melanie.[23][27] The altercation resulted in Cousins breaking his arm.[58]\n\nIn May 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner were questioned about their acquaintance with John Kizon and Troy Mercanti, two Perth underworld figures who were allegedly involved in a stabbing and shooting at Perth's Metro City nightclub.[59] Cousins was in Melbourne at the time of the shooting, but it was claimed that he and Gardiner had received phone calls from the figures both before and after the incident at the nightclub.[29][60] Police questioned Cousins and Gardiner about the incident but they refused to co-operate.[61] Newspaper columnists at The West Australian and talkback radio callers demanded Cousins resign his captaincy.[59] His judgment had previously been questioned by West Coast management after he and Gardiner were photographed entering Crown Casino with Kizon in 2001.[59] However, no disciplinary action was taken. Trevor Nesbitt, the team's chief executive, said:[59]\n\n\"We are prepared to give them more than one chance. In this case, it is maybe their last chance... They have had chances before, they have had opportunities before, they have made mistakes before. It gets to the point where those mistakes can't be tolerated any longer. This hurts us. It hurts our brand. It hurts our image.\"\nOn 12 February 2006, Cousins fled a booze bus, abandoning his Mercedes-Benz and girlfriend Samantha Druce in the middle lane of Perth's Canning Highway and running from police with a male passenger.[26] The male passenger was later caught and breath-tested, but Cousins eluded the police by swimming into the Swan River.[26][62] On 20 February, Cousins resigned as captain of the West Coast Eagles.[26] He pleaded guilty to obstructing the path of another driver and obstructing a public officer in court in March 2006 and was fined $900 plus costs.[63] He was fined an additional $5,000 by West Coast.[64]\n\nOn 3 December 2006, Cousins was arrested for public intoxication after passing out in front of Crown Casino in Melbourne and spent four hours in jail.[58] He was released without being fined or making a court appearance.[65] The West Coast Eagles later announced that the club would not discipline Cousins, stating that the media scrutiny was sufficient punishment.[66]\n\nIn early March 2007, Cousins and his girlfriend of 13 years, Samantha Druce, ended their relationship.[67] On 20 March, Cousins was suspended indefinitely from West Coast after failing to attend two training sessions.[28] West Coast club chairman Dalton Gooding stated at a press conference that Cousins was facing a \"number of personal and professional issues\" and that \"Over the past few weeks those issues have come to the surface and it's time that Ben was suspended from the club to go away and try to tackle those issues head on.\" He also said:[28]\n\n\"We always said we would suspend players if they reoffended and Ben has reoffended by missing training, and we have been very consistent with that \u2026 We believe he's breached his contract and acted unprofessionally and that's why he's been suspended and that's why we're giving him every opportunity to fix up his personal and private issues.\"\nIt was later revealed that Cousins underwent an AFL drug test on 19 March 2007,[68] and it was later confirmed that he had a substance abuse problem.[29] On 21 March, Cousins was admitted to drug rehabilitation.[69] On 22 March, his father Bryan released a statement in a video broadcast by Network Ten:[70]\n\n\"I am making this statement today not on behalf of Ben, but as a father on behalf of his son... Ben's problem relates to substance abuse and he faces a great challenge... We acknowledge the public scrutiny that comes with the opportunities and privileges that Ben has had, but I ask now with the issues that Ben faces, that my son be given the privacy and the opportunity that he needs to deal with this problem... Ben, you are not alone with this challenge. Your family, your friends, your fans and your footy club want you to overcome this issue and win in the same manner in which you have done throughout your whole career.\"\nAt the end of March 2007,[27] Cousins flew to Malibu, California, for rehabilitation at the Summit Center where he stayed for four weeks.[71] He returned to Perth on 30 April 2007, with much attention from the media.[71] On 4 May, he released a televised apology, saying:[72]\n\n\"As you are aware, I have been at an overseas rehabilitation centre for the past month undergoing treatment for a number of personal issues, including illness as the result of substance use... I apologise to the West Coast Eagles Football Club, sponsors, the AFL and the community for my actions... I know that in order to play football again I will have to be accepted back by the players and staff of the West Coast Eagles and the AFL, and I'm willing to fulfil any obligations imposed on me. At the present time I don't know when I'll play again. My priority is to regain my health, my life and my standing.\"\nChris Mainwaring, a former West Coast Eagles player and close friend of Cousins, died of a drug overdose on 1 October 2007.[73] Cousins received renewed media attention, as he was the last person to see Mainwaring alive, having visited him twice on the night of his death to provide emotional support and deliver food.[74] On 16 October, Cousins was arrested in the Perth suburb of Northbridge after police pulled over his vehicle because of \"the manner of his driving\".[75] Cousins' vehicle was searched, and he was charged with failure to comply with a police-ordered drug assessment and possession of a prohibited drug,[75] the police having found quantities of prescription drugs diazepam, Viagra, oxycodone and Caverta as well as traces of ecstasy and cocaine on a $20 note in the car.[76] Cousins was sacked by West Coast for serious breaches of his agreement with the club the day after his arrest.[4][58] On 19 October, Cousins's lawyer, Shane Brennan, reported that police would drop the drug-related charges against him.[58] On 27 October, Cousins flew to Los Angeles to continue his drug rehabilitation at the Summit Center.[77] The media reported that Cousins was missing and had failed to attend treatment in Malibu,[78] and he was admitted to hospital several days later after an alleged cocaine binge.[79] No charges were laid by US police.[80] He returned to Australia and told a packed media conference that he was \"overcoming a drug addiction\". A week later he flew to the Gold Coast for a three-day alcohol and drug binge during Schoolies week.[81][82]\n\nA painting of Cousins titled Waiting for the Day reached the finals of the 2009 Archibald Prize. Painted by South Australian artist Megan Roodenrys, it shows Cousins in bed battling through a sleepless night during his drug scandal. The painting was bought at auction by a Melbourne businessman the following year for $18,000.[83]\n\nIn March 2010, Cousins was twice admitted to Epworth Hospital after suffering from abdominal pain and cramping. The Richmond Football Club denied reports that it had warned Cousins to curb his drinking amid fears his AFL career could be shortened by excessive alcohol consumption.[84] On 12 April, Cousins was among four Richmond players suspended by the club after a drunken escapade at the team hotel in Sydney earlier that week. Although Cousins was not intoxicated, the club deemed that he had not acted responsibly or in a manner expected of him by the club, and he was suspended for one week.[85] On 5 July, Cousins was admitted to hospital after a \"severe reaction to prescribed sleeping medication\".[citation needed] His hospitalisation prompted debate over the use of legal stimulants such as caffeine and legal sedatives such as sleeping pills among sportspeople, with the Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, disapproving of their use.[86]\n\n\"It's pretty damning. There's no point putting something to air only [for Cousins] to be deregistered for life two minutes after it goes to air.\"\n\n\u2014 Cousins' former manager Ricky Nixon on why Such is Life was not broadcast publicly until after Cousins retired[87]\n\nA feature-length documentary on Cousins' personal problems, filmed over a two-year period, aired on the Seven Network in August 2010. Titled Such is Life, it is named after bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly's alleged last words, which Cousins got tattooed across his torso in 2007.[88][89] Cousins is featured taking illicit drugs, speaking candidly about his addiction and saying that he hopes his story will ultimately help to save lives. It was one of the year's most-watched programs in Australia, with over two million viewers nationwide.[90][91] In November of that year, Cousins released an autiobraphy, Ben Cousins: My Life Story, published by Macmillan Australia.\n\nIn May 2011, it was reported that since Cousins' departure from AFL football his life had lost direction: he had failed to commit to a mining job in Western Australia and was struggling to find focus. His father confirmed that his son's attempt to rebuild his life had taken a \"couple of bad turns\" in the previous three months and that he was battling \"troubled times\".[92] In September 2011, Cousins' partner Maylea Elizabeth Tinecheff gave birth to their first child, a son, Bobby Ernest Cousins.\n\nOn 9 January 2012, Cousins was admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after suffering a fall at a drug rehabilitation clinic. He slipped while getting out of a shower, striking his head on a basin and injuring his neck. It was reported that Cousins had been experiencing continuing problems with illicit drugs, despite seeking help at several drug rehabilitation clinics, and that he had \"never been clean for more than three months.\"[93] It was also reported that he had recently undertaken an extreme drug binge lasting for approximately eight days.[94] Cousins was committed by doctors to a suburban mental health unit under police escort on 13 January 2012 after suffering a four-day episode of drug-induced psychosis while being treated at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital.[94][95]\n\nOn 27 March 2012, Cousins was arrested by police at Esperance Airport, in the south of Western Australia, on suspicion of possession of drugs. He was strip-searched and found to have methylamphetamine secreted in his anus. The initial charge of intent to sell or supply the drug was later downgraded to simple possession, to which Cousins pled guilty and was fined $800.[96] On 17 April 2012, Cousins was arrested and charged again in Western Australia for possession of cannabis and a smoking implement.[97]\n\nOn 11 March 2015, Cousins was arrested in the Perth suburb of Bicton after leading police on a slow-speed car chase, stating he could not stop due to a family emergency.[98] Four days later, it was reported that Cousins had been sent to a mental health facility after he was found inside the Special Air Service's Campbell Barracks in Swanbourne.[99] Cousins was arrested for the third time in two weeks after trying to outrun police in Canning Vale following a \"bizarre incident\" outside a Sikh temple.[100]\n\nIn June 2016, police intervened when Cousins attempted to direct traffic on Perth's Canning Highway. He was described by witnesses as being \"really lost, confused and making no sense at all\", and taken to Fiona Stanley Hospital.[101]\n\nIn November 2016, Cousins failed to appear in court on charges of breaching a violence restraining order and possessing methamphetamine. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest. At around 1:30 am the following day, while driving high on methamphetamine in High Wycombe, he crashed his car head-on into a truck. He sustained minor injuries and was taken to Royal Perth Hospital under police guard.[102]\n\nCousins was arrested in the Perth suburb of Melville in February 2017 and charged with a number of offences related to drugs, violence and stalking, including seven counts of breaching a violence restraining order.[103] The following month, at the Magistrates Court of Western Australia, Cousins was charged with eleven offences and received a 12-month prison sentence.[104] He served his sentence at Acacia Prison.[105] In May 2017, it was reported that Cousins was attacked by another inmate after borrowing his tea cup and not returning it.[106] Cousins became eligible for parole six months into his sentence, but the parole board denied his application and ordered him to complete rehabilitation courses after he failed a drug test.[105]\n\nCousins was released from prison in January 2018.[105] As part of his parole conditions, Cousins began part-time work in the West Coast Eagles' community and game development department, but abruptly left the job in April 2018. In August 2018, he was arrested and charged with multiple offences, including drug possession, making threats and breaking a violence restraining order.[107] He was released on bail in April 2019.[108]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Cousins"}, {"id": 98, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/24/460241/original/andrey-arshavin-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Andrei Arshavin", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/andrey-arshavin/460241", "desc": "Andrey Sergeyevich Arshavin (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0410\u0440\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043d [\u0250n\u02c8dr\u02b2ej s\u02b2\u026ar\u02c8\u0261\u02b2ej\u026av\u02b2\u026at\u0255 \u0250r\u02c8\u0282av\u02b2\u026an]; born 29 May 1981) is a Russian former professional footballer who played as a forward or midfielder.\nArshavin began his career at Zenit Saint Petersburg in 2000.

He went on to win numerous trophies with the club such as the Russian Premier League, League Cup, Russian Super Cup, UEFA Cup and the UEFA Super Cup. During his time with Zenit, Arshavin was also named as the Russian Footballer of the Year.\n\nHe had a breakout performance at UEFA Euro 2008 where he impressed throughout Russia's run to the semi-final of the tournament, and also finished 6th in the 2008 Ballon d\u2019Or.[3] Arshavin thereafter signed for English Premier League club Arsenal during the 2008\u201309 winter transfer window, becoming the most expensive player in Arsenal's history at the time, with a fee of \u00a315\u00a0million. Arshavin eventually rejoined Zenit, at first on loan and then permanently in 2013.[4][5]\n\nArshavin was born in Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, on 29 May 1981. His father Sergey Arshavin played as an amateur footballer. Arshavin survived an accident that could have killed him when he was hit by a car as a child. His parents divorced when he was 12, with Andrey having to sleep on the floor of a cramped flat with his mother. It was his father who persuaded him to pursue a career in football after his own failure to become a professional football player.\n\nArshavin began playing football at an early age and at seven years of age, he was enrolled in the Smena football academy of Zenit, his hometown club. As a schoolboy before football became his sole focus, he was a talented draughts player. Arshavin's father died of heart failure at age 40.[6] He has written three books, including one titled 555 Questions and Answers on Women, Money, Politics and Football.[7] Arshavin also has a degree in Fashion Design.[7] He often misbehaved at school, commenting, \"I behaved badly at school. When I was in the second grade, I tore down the registering journal of the class.\" It was this incident described by Arshavin that saw him expelled.\n\nIn 2000, Arshavin was included in the Zenit first-team squad, making his debut in a 3\u20130 away win over English side Bradford City in the Intertoto Cup,[8] coming on as a first-half substitute for Andrey Kobelev.[9] He played in various positions on the field, starting as a right midfielder, then as an attacking midfielder, and finally adopted the second striker's role playing on a flank or behind the target man.\n\nIn the 2007 Russian Premier League season, Shava (\u0428\u0430\u0432\u0430 in Russian), as he was nicknamed by Zenit fans,[10] guided his Zenit side to the title in starting all 30 matches, scoring 11 goals and providing 11 assists which was the most in the Russian Premier League that year en route.[11] It was the club's first league title since winning the now-defunct Soviet Top League in 1984. Arshavin was also a key player during Zenit's 2007\u201308 UEFA Cup triumph and was named Man of the Match in the final, again topping the list for assists in that season's UEFA competition.[12] In October 2008, Arshavin was nominated for the prestigious Ballon d'Or award, along with 29 others in a list that included compatriot Yuri Zhirkov.[13]\n\nArshavin's performances in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Euro 2008 brought him to the attention of several European clubs.[14] However, interest had already been expressed in January 2008 by Newcastle United boss Sam Allardyce, but he was sacked as manager as the transfer window opened.[15] In June 2008, Barcelona had their \u20ac15\u00a0million offer for the player turned down by Zenit.[citation needed] Additionally, Tottenham Hotspur's \u00a316\u00a0million offer in August also fell short of Zenit's \u00a322\u00a0million asking price.[16] Zenit's unwillingness to compromise on their asking price caused discontent from both Arshavin and his agent Dennis Lachter.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the January 2009 transfer window, Arshavin was persistently pursued by English Premier League club Arsenal. On 2 February, transfer deadline day, Arshavin was staying in a Hertfordshire hotel, just a few miles from the Arsenal training ground. At around 10\u00a0am,[17] he left the hotel and was rumoured to be heading back to Russia, but with less than an hour of the transfer window left, a bid from Arsenal was finally accepted by Zenit. By this point, he had agreed personal terms and passed a medical, but a compensation payment by Arshavin himself to Zenit was supposedly holding up the deal.[18] The deal was further complicated by a snowstorm in England that had delayed the Premier League's registration process, eventually forcing the league to extend the deadline beyond 5\u00a0pm.[19] The deal was not confirmed until the following day (3 February), nearly 24 hours after the formal transfer deadline had passed, with Arsenal announcing \"a long-term deal\" for an undisclosed fee.[20] On the same day, Zenit's official web site claimed that Zenit received an official FA letter confirming Arshavin's registration as an Arsenal player.\n\nAt Arsenal Arshavin wore the number 23 shirt, last worn by Sol Campbell. As Arshavin had played for Zenit in the 2008\u201309 Champions League, he was cup-tied and could not play for Arsenal in the knockout phase.[21] Arshavin made his debut for Arsenal against Sunderland on 21 February 2009 in the Premier League, which ended 0\u20130. On 3 March 2009, Arshavin made his first contribution in a Premier League game against West Bromwich Albion by setting up a goal for Kolo Tour\u00e9 in the 38th minute via a free-kick, the second goal in a 3\u20131 victory. On 14 March 2009, Arshavin scored his first Arsenal goal in a very tight angle going solo against Blackburn Rovers in the 65th minute of the game. He later provided an assist to Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 for the third goal of the game, which ended 4\u20130 to Arsenal.[22]\n\nOn 21 April 2009, Arshavin was named Man of the Match when he scored all four Arsenal goals in a tight match against Liverpool at Anfield, which ended 4\u20134. It was a thrilling encounter, and the first time Arshavin had scored four goals in one match in his entire career.[23] He also became the first away player to score four goals in a single league match at Anfield since Dennis Westcott for Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1946,[24] and the first Arsenal player to score four goals in any match since J\u00falio Baptista in 2007, who also achieved the feat against Liverpool at Anfield. Additionally, he became only the sixth player in Premier League history to score four goals in an away match.[25] Arshavin captained Arsenal for the first time on 2 May 2009 in an away match against Portsmouth, where they won 3\u20130 with Arshavin gaining two assists and a contentious penalty.[citation needed] On 8 May, he was named Premier League Player of the Month for April.[26] He was also voted as Arsenal's Player of the Month for April[27] and May[28] and came second in Arsenal's Player of the Season poll, despite only playing in the second half of the season and playing in fewer than a quarter of Arsenal's matches all season.[29]\n\nArshavin came off the bench to score two goals in Arsenal's 2\u20131 pre-season victory on 1 August over Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Emirates Cup. Manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger commented afterward that \"[Arshavin] knows how English football works\", adding, \"He knows as well that now he's part of the team from the start. I believe the team knows as well how important (he is) and how big an impact he can have on the results.\"[30] On 26 August 2009, Arshavin scored his first UEFA Champions League goal for Arsenal in the 74th minute in a 3\u20131 win over Celtic. He also scored a 30-yard shot against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 29 August 2009, which was his first goal of the season although Arsenal lost the match 2\u20131.[31] In early December, Arshavin put in an excellent display against Stoke City, playing in an unfamiliar role as centre-forward left vacant after Robin van Persie's injury. He won a penalty which F\u00e0bregas missed before scoring himself and later assisted the second goal, with Arsenal winning the match 2\u20130.[32]\n\nOn 13 December 2009, Arshavin scored his fifth goal against Liverpool as Arsenal came from behind to beat Liverpool 2\u20131 at Anfield again, also winning the Man of the Match award in the end again.[33] On 20 January 2010, he scored again in Arsenal's 4\u20132 victory over Bolton Wanderers, which helped Arsenal reach the top of the Premier League for the first time since August.[34]\nHowever, he suffered a calf strain against Barcelona, ruling him out for three weeks. Arshavin missed one of two games in May due to injury, but scored for the last time of the season against Fulham, in a match which Arsenal won 4\u20130.\n\nOn 17 July 2010, Arshavin scored the opening goal against Barnet in Arsenal's first pre-season friendly match of the season, which Arsenal won 4\u20130.[35] He then won the Man of the Match award for best performance by Arsenal fans according to Arsenal's official website.[36] On 21 August 2010, Arshavin scored his first goal of the season via a penalty for Arsenal in a 6\u20130 win over Blackpool after Marouane Chamakh was fouled by Ian Evatt in the penalty area.[37] He also scored in Arsenal's very next game on 28 August 2010, scoring the winning goal against Blackburn Rovers for the third time when Cesc F\u00e0bregas' shot was blocked and fell into the path of Arshavin, Arsenal winning the match 2\u20131.[38]\n\nOn 15 September 2010, Arshavin scored and provided two assists against Braga in Arsenal's first Champions League group stage match, with Arsenal winning 6\u20130.[39] On 18 September 2010, Arshavin scored his first League Cup goal, which was also Arsenal's fourth goal during extra time, to defeat Tottenham in the third round of the League Cup, with Arsenal winning against their arch rivals 4\u20131.[40] He later scored Arsenal's first goal in a 3\u20131 midweek Champions League away win against FK Partizan in the 15th minute after a backheel pass by Jack Wilshere. Vladimir Stojkovi\u0107 saved Arshavin's penalty in the second half after Marouane Chamakh was fouled in the penalty area.[41]\n\nOn 27 November 2010, Arshavin scored his first goal since September, which was the opening goal against Aston Villa in a 4\u20132 away win.[42] On 29 December 2010, Arshavin scored a scissor kick volley to bring Arsenal level when they were 1\u20130 down to Wigan Athletic. He later made an assist for Nicklas Bendtner to put Arsenal 2\u20131 up, but after a S\u00e9bastien Squillaci own goal, the match ended 2\u20132.[43] He then won the Man of the Match award for best performance by Arsenal fans for the second time.[44]\n\nOn 1 February 2011, Arshavin came off the bench in the 62nd minute and scored his first 2011-goal and first goal since December just 8 minutes later to make Arsenal level when they were 1\u20130 down to Everton in a game that Arsenal won 2\u20131.[45] He then won the Man of the Match award for best performance by Arsenal fans for the third time.[46] On 16 February 2011, Arshavin scored as Arsenal beat Barcelona for the first time in their history in a 2\u20131 win in the Champions League round of 16. This was Arshavin's first Champions League goal for Arsenal not scored in the group stage.[47] The next day, Arsenal centre back Johan Djourou stated that \"Arshavin showed he is a great player,\" because of his winning goal and his rising performance from his recent dip in form.[48] During his goal celebration against Barcelona, Arshavin memorably lifted up his jersey to reveal a t-shirt with an image of himself performing his normal finger-to-the-lips celebration.[49]\n\nOn 20 February 2011, Arsenal faced Leyton Orient for The FA Cup fifth-round, a 1\u20131 draw in which Arshavin won the Man of the Match award for best performance by Arsenal fans[50] for the fourth time, even though he did not score, though he did come close numerous times.[51] Arshavin's next Premier League goal was away to West Bromwich Albion, bringing the score to 2\u20131 after West Brom had earlier taken a 2\u20130 lead. He also provided the cross for Robin van Persie's late equaliser in that game.\n\nOn 10 September 2011, Arshavin scored his first goal of the season against Swansea City after a bizarre mistake by goalkeeper Michel Vorm. His other performances in the season were riddled with criticism about his refusal to track back and help with defense. During a home game against Manchester United, Arshavin was booed when he came on for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain although it is believed that the booing was directed at the decision to make a substitution and not at Arshavin himself.\n\nOn 11 February 2012, Arshavin provided Thierry Henry with the winning goal in the match against Sunderland. After coming on during the second half, Arshavin found space to deliver a cross during injury time, from the left side of the pitch despite being marked by two players. The cross found Henry's foot and made it into the back of the net.[52]\n\nAfter intense speculation about joining Anzhi Makhachkala and reuniting with former Russian national team coach Guus Hiddink, Arshavin sealed a loan move to his boyhood club Zenit Saint Petersburg for the remainder of the 2011\u201312 season, just 40 seconds before the end of the deadline day of the Russian transfer window.[53] An intention to hold on to a place in Russia's Euro 2012 squad was the reason behind Arshavin's move to Luciano Spalletti's side in Saint Petersburg.\n\nOn 3 March, Arshavin made his loan debut for Zenit in an away fixture against CSKA Moscow which ended in a 2\u20132 draw. Arshavin wasn't eligible to feature in Zenit's 2\u20130 loss to Benfica in the last 16 of the Champions League.[54] In total, Arshavin made 11 appearances in his second spell at Zenit, scoring three goals.\n\nArshavin returned to Arsenal for the start of the 2012\u201313 season. He appeared as a 77th-minute substitute in their first game of the season, a 0\u20130 draw against Sunderland on 18 August 2012.[55] On 26 September, Arshavin was handed his first start of the season in the League Cup. He scored the third goal and assisted two others in a 6\u20131 win over Coventry City.[56] On 20 October, Arshavin made his 100th Premier League appearance for Arsenal in a 1\u20130 loss against Norwich City. He also played in Arsenal's 2\u20131 loss against Olympiacos in the Champions League on 4 December. Arshavin went on to leave Arsenal in June 2013.[5]\nAll in all Arshavin scored 31 goals with a sum of 41 assists which came from 143 caps for the club altogether.[5]\n\nOn 27 June 2013, it was announced that Arshavin signed a two-year deal with Zenit, moving on a free transfer. Arshavin stated that he was \"very happy to put on Zenit's shirt again.\"[57]\n\nArshavin scored on his second league appearance for the club, opening a 1\u20131 draw at home to Kuban Krasnodar on 26 July,[58] before netting again on 7 August, in a 5\u20130 win in the Champions League third qualifying round against FC Nordsj\u00e6lland.[59] In a total of 21 Russian Premier League appearances in 2013\u201314, he scored only one more goal, in a 4\u20130 away win at Rostov on 22 September,[60] and Zenit finished the season as runners-up.\n\nOn 13 July 2015, Arshavin signed for Kuban Krasnodar on a one-year deal.[61] His contract was dissolved by mutual consent on 1 February 2016.[62]\n\nOn 18 March 2016, Arshavin signed for FC Kairat on a one-year deal, with the option of a second year.[63] He also won the Kazakhstan Premier League's Player of the Month award for July 2016, and again in September 2016.[64] Arshavin extended his stay at the club for an additional year on 9 November 2016.[65] \nHe was after such bestowed with the Kazakhstan Player of the Year award for 2016.[66]\nArshavin went on to win with Kairat the Kazakhstan Super Cup of 2017.[67]\nOn 5 November 2018, Kairat announced that Arshavin will leave the club after his farewell game on 11 November 2018.[68]\n\nOn 3 December 2018, Arshavin confirmed his retirement as a player.[69]\n\nArshavin debuted for the Russian national team on 17 May 2002, but was overlooked for the Russia squads at the 2002 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2004.[70] His first goal with the squad came in a friendly match versus Romania on 13 February 2003. Since then, he has managed to score or assist in every competition which Russia has participated in. He was Russia's captain in a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia. On 11 June 2009, Arshavin was made first-choice captain for Russia by manager Guus Hiddink.\n\nArshavin was included in Russia's Euro 2008 squad by Guus Hiddink, despite being unable to play in the first two group matches due to suspension.[71] He announced his return by setting up the first goal and scoring the second in Russia's final group game against Sweden at Tivoli Neu, Innsbruck, which helped his team qualify for the next round.\n\nIn the next match, the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Arshavin repeated the feat with his part in Russia's two goals in the second half of extra time, providing the cross for Dmitri Torbinski's goal and scoring his own four minutes later. Russia consequently reached the semi-finals with a 3\u20131 victory. For both of these games, UEFA awarded him Man of the Match. However, Arshavin could not repeat the heroics in the semi-final against eventual winners Spain, which Russia lost 3\u20130. Despite this, Arshavin was named in UEFA's squad for Euro 2008.[72] He, along with the rest of the Russian team, received a bronze medal.[73]\n\nArshavin captained the team to a second-place finish in their group, scoring three goals in ten games. He provided the assist for Diniyar Bilyaletdinov's second goal to seal a 2\u20131 win over Slovenia in the first leg of the qualification play-offs. Despite this, Russia lost the second leg 1\u20130, knocking them out of the World Cup finals on away goals.\n\nArshavin was confirmed for the finalized UEFA Euro 2012 squad on 25 May 2012.[74] He started all three of their games in the group stage of Group A, as Russia were eliminated in the group stage, finishing third place behind on the head-to-head ruling. Nonetheless, Arshavin was statistically named the best midfielder of the tournament by UEFA, having earned the most assists in the fewest minutes on the pitch (270 minutes). After the tournament, Russian fans were left disappointed by comments from Arshavin, who said: \"the fact that we [Russian national team] hadn't exceed your [fans] expectations is not our [the players'] problem, it is your [fans'] problems.\" Arshavin later apologized for his comment as well as Russia's early exit from the tournament.[75]\n\nAfter playing in new manager Fabio Capello's first match in charge, a friendly match with Ivory Coast,[76] Arshavin was omitted from Russia's squad for the entirety of its 2014 World Cup qualification campaign.[77][78]\n\nOn 2 December 2010, Arshavin made a speech during Russia's presentation of its successful bid for the 2018 World Cup.\n\nArshavin carried the Olympic Flame during the St. Petersburg leg of the torch relay for the 2008 Summer Olympics.[79]\n\nArshavin and his former common-law wife Julia Baranovskaya[80] met in 2003. They have three children, two sons named Artyom[81] and Arseniy.[82] and daughter Yana.[81] On 14 August 2012, Arshavin confirmed on his official website that he and Julia had their second son, Arseniy.[82] In September 2016, he married Alisa Arshavina, with whom he has a daughter. After a year of marriage, the couple reportedly divorced.[83]\n\nNotes\n\nZenit Saint Petersburg[67]\n\nKairat[67]\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Arshavin"}, {"id": 99, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/96/1916454/original/1916454-photo-u2?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Robbie Fowler", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/robbie-fowler/1916454", "desc": "Robert Bernard Fowler (born 9 April 1975) is an English former professional footballer and manager who played as a striker from 1993 to 2012.

He is best known for his time at Liverpool, initially from 1993 to 2001. He scored 183 goals in total for Liverpool, earning the nickname \"God\" from the Anfield fans, and he is Liverpool's second-top scorer in the Premier League.[4] He subsequently played for Leeds United and Manchester City, before returning to Liverpool in January 2006. He moved to Cardiff City eighteen months later. He played there for a year before transferring to Blackburn Rovers on a short-term deal. In December 2008, he departed Blackburn and played in Australia with North Queensland Fury and Perth Glory. In 2011, he joined Thai side Muangthong United as a player, but later was appointed player-manager, which he remained until his retirement in 2012.\n\nFowler was capped for England 26 times, scoring 7 goals. He was included in England's squads for Euro 1996, Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Socially aware, Fowler showed support for the Liverpool dockers' strike during a goal celebration in 1997 where he unveiled a t-shirt which incorporated the Calvin Klein \"CK\" into the word doCKer.[5]\n\nFowler was born in Toxteth, Liverpool, and brought up in the inner city area of Liverpool. At this time he was known as Robert Ryder, his mother's surname.[6] He lived in Toxteth at the time of the 1981 Toxteth riots, when he was six years old. As a youngster he supported Everton F.C.[7] He played regularly for schoolboy team Thorvald, and once scored 16 times in a 26\u20130 rout.[8]\n\nDespite growing up as an Everton fan, Fowler's career began with Liverpool. He signed as a youth team player on leaving school in the summer of 1991, signing professional terms on his 17th birthday, 9 April 1992.\n\nFowler's first involvement with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, when he was an unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England under-18 team win the 1993 European Championship,[9] before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3\u20131 win in a second round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993.[10] Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture.[11] He scored his first league hat-trick against Southampton on 30 October 1993 in only his fifth league game. His very first league goal for the Reds had come on 16 October 1993, when an 87th-minute equaliser at home to struggling Oldham Athletic saved the Reds from what would have been one of the biggest Premier League shocks of the season, with a last gasp own goal giving Liverpool a 2\u20131 win.[12] He scored twice in a thrilling 3\u20133 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December 1993.[13]\n\nHis first 13 games for the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio throughout the season, but finished his first season as the club's second top scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, Ian Rush had scored 19. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making an impact in any of the major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up hope for a brighter future at Anfield after the disappointment of the first two FA Premier League seasons.[11]\n\nDuring the 1994\u201395 season Fowler was a constant member of the Liverpool side, playing in all of their 57 competitive matches, including the victory in the 1995 League Cup final, and a match against Arsenal on 28 August 1994 in which he scored what was then the Premier League's second-fastest hat-trick ever, in four minutes and 33 seconds.[14] His record stood for twenty years until broken by Sadio Man\u00e9 on 16 May 2015 for Southampton against Aston Villa, who scored three goals in two minutes and 56 seconds.[15] He scored braces against Aston Villa, Ipswich Town, Chelsea and Norwich City in the league that season. Fowler was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year in two consecutive years in 1995 and 1996,[16] a feat also achieved only by Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Dele Alli.[17][18]\n\nThroughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England.[19] Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than 30 goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. He remains the only player to have scored 30 plus goals in his first three full seasons in England scoring 98 goals with a total of 116 in just over three years. Fowler's partnership with Steve McManaman was largely described as the reason why Liverpool had become the club known for being the most potent attacking force in England at the time,[20] and Fowler was renowned for scoring goals of all varieties, from every angle and distance, with McManaman describing him as the \"greatest goalscorer of all time\".[21]\n\nStan Collymore, Fowler's regular strike partner for two seasons from 1995, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore were among the most prolific goal-scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995\u201396 season, with \u00a38.4million signing Collymore replacing the veteran Ian Rush as Fowler's regular partner in attack after his arrival in June 1995. In the same season, he scored twice in a 4\u20133 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup Final that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won 1\u20130. He had scored four goals against United in the league that season, scoring twice in a 2\u20132 draw at Old Trafford on 1 October 1995, and twice in a 2\u20130 win at Anfield on 16 December.[22]\n\nFowler received a call-up to the full England squad and won his first cap on 27 March 1996 as a substitute in a friendly against Bulgaria.[16] His first start at international level was against Croatia which was the England game following his substitute appearance. Fowler was part of the England squad for Euro 1996, making two appearances in the tournament.[23] On 14 December 1996, he scored four against Middlesbrough, including his hundredth for Liverpool. This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner, Ian Rush, in just 165 games.[citation needed]\n\nThat year, he also won a UEFA Fair Play award for denying that he had been fouled by Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman at Highbury after a penalty had been given.[24] After unsuccessfully trying to persuade the referee to change his decision about the penalty, Fowler took it tamely and Seaman saved. However, Seaman failed to hold on to the ball and Jason McAteer scored from the rebound.[25] Although many people believe that he deliberately took the penalty kick poorly for reasons of fair play, Fowler said at the time: \"As a goalscorer it's part of my job to take it and I wanted to score it. I tried to score. I never missed on purpose. It just happened, it was a bad penalty.\"[26]\n\nFowler was part of a group of Liverpool players from the mid-1990s who were dubbed \"The Spice Boys\" by the press following a series of off-field controversies. The term was coined by the Daily Mail, and arose due to misplaced rumours that Fowler was dating Spice Girl Emma Bunton.[27] The term was subsequently used in a derogatory manner, implying Fowler and colleagues such as Jamie Redknapp, Stan Collymore, David James and Steve McManaman were underachieving playboys. Still, Liverpool were top of the Premier League by Christmas 1996. By the end of January, however, they had been leapfrogged by Manchester United, who remained top for the rest of the season.\n\nFowler's performance in the 1997\u201398 football season was marred by an anterior cruciate (knee) ligament injury that kept him out of action for half of the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup.[28] During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence and played alongside him when Fowler regained his fitness.\n\nIn 1999, Fowler was fined \u00a360,000 by his club for bringing the game into disrepute. While celebrating his goal against Liverpool's Merseyside rivals, Everton, Fowler used the white line of the penalty area to simulate cocaine use.[16][29] Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier stated that this was a Cameroonian grass-eating celebration, learnt from teammate Rigobert Song.[30] Defending himself, Fowler later said this was a response to Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of drug abuse. Fowler received a four-match suspension from the FA for this incident.\n\nThe 2000\u201301 season was Fowler's most successful season. He scored 17 goals, appeared in three finals, and lifted three trophies in a unique cup treble.[31] In the absence of Jamie Redknapp, who was sidelined by injury, Fowler was named as Liverpool captain when he started.[11] However he found himself the third-choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey.[11]\n\nHe took part in a fourth-round League Cup hammering of Stoke City, scoring a hat-trick in an 8\u20130 victory, which was second only to the club's biggest ever win in 1986 \u2013 a 10\u20130 defeat of Fulham.[32] In the League Cup final against Birmingham City, the club's first cup final since 1996, he captained the side and scored in the 30th minute. Liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties, with Fowler scoring Liverpool's fifth in the shootout. Fowler picked up the Alan Hardaker Man of the Match award and lifted the trophy.\n\nFowler's season picked up from there as he scored several important goals including one against runaway champions Manchester United and a free kick in the FA Cup semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers. Fowler featured as a substitute in the 2001 FA Cup Final coming on as a 77th-minute replacement for Vladim\u00edr \u0160micer. Liverpool, who were 1\u20130 down at that point, eventually won the game 2\u20131 with two goals from Owen. Fowler raised the trophy along with Sami Hyypi\u00e4 and Jamie Redknapp.\n\nFour days later he was a substitute again in Liverpool's third final, the 2001 UEFA Cup Final against Deportivo Alav\u00e9s. He came on in the 64th minute for Heskey with the score at 3\u20133. He scored seven minutes later but Alav\u00e9s equalised before full-time and Liverpool eventually won with a golden goal, an own goal, in the 116th minute.[33] Fowler and Hyypi\u00e4 then raised Liverpool's third trophy of the season together. Liverpool's next and final game of the season was against Charlton Athletic and Fowler scored twice in a 4\u20130 victory at The Valley that assured them UEFA Champions League qualification for the next season.[34]\n\nFowler began the 2001\u201302 season controversially, after being dropped by the then manager G\u00e9rard Houllier from the Liverpool squad for the 2001 Charity Shield match, following a training ground confrontation with assistant manager Phil Thompson.[35] He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3\u20132 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich,[36] but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4\u20131, but was dropped for the following league match. Though Fowler had been on a contract extension from 1999 (unlike Steve McManaman \u2013 who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year), Fowler was linked to Lazio, Arsenal and Leeds United, and Liverpool's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported that what happened with McManaman (regarded as a huge financial loss) would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration.[37] This meant that coupled with Fowler's relationship with Houllier, speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans.[38][39] His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland, in which he was substituted at half-time.[40][41]\n\nDespite his popularity with Liverpool fans, who referred to Fowler as \"God\",[42] Michael Owen and Emile Heskey had established themselves as Liverpool's regular strike partnership, leaving Fowler on the fringes of the first team. This, along with his difficult relationship with Houllier, made him seek regular first team football away from Anfield in the form of a \u00a312 million move to Leeds United.[43] Fowler maintains that Houllier forced him out of Liverpool, and accused Houllier of pressuring the Liverpool Echo newspaper to use its influence to turn opinion against him.[44]\n\nThe transfer went ahead just one month after his hat-trick at Leicester. He made his Leeds debut in an away game against Fulham in December 2001,[45] the same ground where he had made his Liverpool debut eight years earlier. Fowler scored 12 goals in the remainder of the season, helping Leeds to a UEFA Cup qualifying place. Fowler was included in the England squad for the 2002 World Cup, but only made one appearance, coming on as a substitute in a second-round win over Denmark.\n\nFowler suffered an aggravation of a pre-existing hip injury in the 2002\u201303 pre-season, and did not recover until December.[43] Struggling to gain fitness, and seeing teammates sold off due to a financial crisis, Fowler's form and market value diminished. It was despite this decrease in form that he still, in total, scored 15 goals in 31 appearances for Leeds; achieving an impressive strike rate of just less than one goal every two games. In 2002\u201303, Leeds finished 15th in the Premier League and a severe financial crisis was developing.\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Fowler was transferred to Manchester City following a protracted transfer saga. Fowler initially turned down the move and a dispute between Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan and chairman David Bernstein over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in Bernstein leaving the club.[46] Following encouragement from Keegan, Fowler finally signed for Manchester City on 16 January 2003 for an initial fee of \u00a33 million and a further \u00a33 million dependent upon appearances.[16] Bizarre transfer conditions meant Leeds United still paid a significant proportion of Fowler's wages.[47] Fowler made his Manchester City debut against West Bromwich Albion on 1 February 2003,[48] but made a poor start to his Manchester City career, scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season.\n\nFowler continued to struggle with fitness problems in the 2003\u201304 season, completing the full 90 minutes only nine times, however, he did score against his old club, Liverpool, in a 2\u20132 draw at home. The arrival of close friend Steve McManaman from Real Madrid gave Fowler hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership from their time at Liverpool, and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries and alleged excesses;[49] they were named and shamed in a sex scandal covered by the News of the World[50] that year.\n\nDespite the slump, Fowler rallied for the following campaign, and showed a marked improvement in the second half of the 2004\u201305 season, scoring his 150th Premiership goal in the 3\u20132 win over Norwich City on 28 February 2005. However, his failure to convert a 90th-minute penalty kick against Middlesbrough's Mark Schwarzer in the final game of the season prevented Manchester City from gaining a place in the UEFA Cup.[51] Despite this, Fowler ended the season as the club's joint top goal scorer and gained the approval of the fans, finishing in the top three in the fans' Player of the Year poll.[52] Fowler later described this as \"one of the proudest achievements of my career\".[53]\n\nFowler had injury problems at the start of the 2005\u201306 season and rarely featured when fit, making just two substitute appearances in the first four months of the season. His first start of the season came against Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup on 7 January 2006, in which he scored a hat-trick.[54] The following week he scored Manchester City's third goal in their 3\u20131 win against local rivals Manchester United after coming on as a substitute. However, Fowler made only one more appearance for Manchester City before returning to Liverpool on a free transfer.[55]\n\nOn 27 January 2006, Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, signing a contract until the end of the season. Fowler had remained a Liverpool fan after he left the club; he was in the Istanbul crowd when Liverpool won the Champions League in 2005.\n\nLiverpool fans were delighted to learn that Fowler had returned; there were large banners in the game against Birmingham City which read 'God \u2013 number eleven, welcome back to heaven', with 'God' being Fowler's nickname while he was previously at Liverpool.\n\nFowler's return against Birmingham City in February 2006 was labelled by the tabloid press as the stuff of fairytales,[citation needed] and he said he felt like \"a kid waking up on Christmas morning every day\".[42] Fowler's first appearance back at Anfield was as a substitute against Birmingham, receiving a standing ovation upon his introduction.[56] After his return, he had three goals ruled out for offside, before finally getting off the mark on 15 March 2006 in a home game against Fulham, the same opponents against which he scored his first-ever goal for Liverpool 13 years earlier.\n\nFowler's next Liverpool goal, against West Bromwich Albion, meant he overtook Kenny Dalglish in the club's all-time top scorers. His resurgence continued as he marked his 31st birthday with a goal against Bolton Wanderers. He made it four goals in five games when he scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Blackburn Rovers on 16 April 2006. However, Fowler's fitness remained a concern. In March 2006, manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez commented on Fowler's work and progress by saying, \"to buy a Robbie Fowler who is fit and scoring goals would cost a lot, maybe \u00a310m or more\". Despite concerns about his fitness, Fowler finished the 2005\u201306 season scoring on a more consistent basis than Liverpool's other strikers. In May 2006 he was offered a new one-year contract with the club,[57] and celebrated by scoring the first goal in Liverpool's last league game of the season in a 3\u20131 away win at Portsmouth. It was his final game of the season as he was unable to take part in the club's FA Cup Final success due to being cup-tied.\n\nFowler featured rarely in his final Liverpool season, making only six league starts. Bizarrely, all three of his League goals were penalties against Sheffield United. One of these was in the away game on the opening day of the season, and the other two in the reverse fixture at Anfield. Appearances in other competitions were more common due to Rafael Ben\u00edtez's squad rotation policy. On 25 October 2006 Fowler was named as Liverpool's captain for the first time since his return in a League Cup tie against Reading, scoring just before half-time in a 4\u20133 win.\n\nOn 5 December, Fowler scored his first two goals in the UEFA Champions League competition proper against Galatasaray (he had previously scored during a qualifying tie some six years prior against FC Haka),[58][59] though Liverpool lost 3\u20132.\n\nOn 1 May 2007, he was a substitute in the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, brought on in the last few minutes of extra-time. He set up an attack for Dirk Kuyt but the shot went straight at the Chelsea goalkeeper. The match went into a penalty shoot-out that Liverpool won. Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, but the game had already ended when Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.[60]\n\nIn what transpired to be his last appearance for the club, against Charlton Athletic on 13 May, Fowler was given the captain's armband one final time. He was substituted two minutes from the final whistle and given a standing ovation. He finished his second run as a Liverpool player with a UEFA Champions League runners-up medal, although he was not named in either the starting eleven or the seven substitutes. He became a free agent on 1 July having scored 183 goals in 369 appearances during his two spells at the club.[10]\n\nOn 21 July 2007 Fowler signed a two-year contract to play for Cardiff City.[61] He missed the season's opening fixtures due to a lack of fitness,[62] making his debut in a League Cup tie on 28 August.[63] He scored his first two Cardiff goals on 22 September against Preston North End, scoring with two headers.[64] Fowler scored twice in his next game, a third round League Cup tie against West Brom, which Cardiff won 4\u20132.[65] This led to a fourth round tie against Fowler's former club Liverpool, at Anfield, to which even the Liverpool faithful crowd urged Fowler to score seeing that it may be the last time he would play in Anfield but Cardiff were knocked out in a 2\u20131 defeat.[66]\n\nIn November, Fowler travelled to Frankfurt, Germany to see Dr. Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt, a specialist sports injuries doctor, to try and resolve a recurring hip problem that had left him lacking fitness in early season fixtures for the Bluebirds.[67] The treatment involved taking around twenty-eight injections into his hip. He returned to full training in late November and made his comeback on 15 December as a late substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat against Bristol City.[68] However he went on to suffer another injury blow just days later after a mistimed tackle in training from club captain Darren Purse left him with damaged ankle ligaments.[69][70] Due to the new injury blow Cardiff and Fowler made plans for him to go to Colorado, United States to undergo keyhole surgery on the hip problem, which had plagued him in recent seasons, in the hope that it would finally resolve the problem.[71]\n\nOn 17 January 2008, it was announced that Fowler could miss the rest of the 2007\u201308 season for Cardiff after his hip operation revealed that the injury was worse than previously thought. Surgeons were forced to perform a micro-fracture for the hip to heal properly.[72] Despite this, he attempted to make a comeback at the end of the season to play in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth and was included in the 18-man match squad.[73] He did not feature in the game in and thus did not receive a runners-up medal having not made an appearance in the competition.[74]\n\nFowler was offered a new pay-as-you-play contract with Cardiff for the 2008\u201309 season in May 2008 and was expected to sign the contract. However, he pulled out of the deal, preferring to accept an offer of a trial at Blackburn Rovers from former Liverpool colleague Paul Ince. The move left Cardiff manager Dave Jones and chairman Peter Ridsdale furious after the club had assisted Fowler's rehabilitation throughout the summer. After training with Blackburn and appearing in a handful of friendlies he was offered a six-month deal by the club to last until January, but Fowler turned down the deal due to it being a shorter offer than the previous one he had rejected at Cardiff. After turning down the offer, Fowler made a shock enquiry about returning to Cardiff on the deal he had originally turned down, prompting anger from supporters and a swift \"no thanks\" from the club.[75]\n\nFowler concluded the trial period at Blackburn by agreeing to a three-month pay-as-you-play deal.[76][77] He stated that he was eager to return to the Premier League and that his pre-existing relationship with Ince would not earn him any preferential treatment.[76] He made his first appearance against Everton in a 1\u20130 win in the League Cup on 24 September.[78] With a month left on his contract at Blackburn, Fowler received interest from League Two side Grimsby Town. Fowler, a friend of then Grimsby manager Mike Newell had held talks at Blundell Park over a possible Player/Coach role with the club.[79]\n\nHis three-month deal at Blackburn expired on 12 December 2008,[80] and after not being offered a new contract was released by the club,[81] he entered talks with new Australian A-League club North Queensland Fury.[82]\n\nFowler signed with the North Queensland Fury on 4 February 2009 and became their inaugural marquee player; with his family relocating to Townsville for the 2009\u201310 season of the Australian A-League.[83] It was an important signing for the new franchise who struggled to sign a marquee player, while some questioned whether Fowler would be able to cope with the heat and humidity of North Queensland.[84]\n\nFowler made his debut in July 2009 in a 2\u20131 pre-season loss against Wolverhampton Wanderers in Perth after recovering from groin and hip complaints.[85] Fowler was subsequently named North Queensland Fury's captain for the 2009\u201310 season and the first[citation needed] in the club's history. He scored his first A-League goal from a penalty kick in his club's first competitive match against Sydney FC on Saturday 8 August 2009. In rounds four, five, and six Fowler scored Solo's Hyundai A-League Goal of the Week.\n\nShortly after his arrival in Australia, it was reported in the British media that Fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler's former Liverpool teammate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to England.[86] When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports too were dismissed.[87]\n\nControversy erupted around Fowler after he reportedly refused to play against the Brisbane Roar on 23 January after being named on the interchange bench for the clash.[88] He, however, returned to the starting line up for two of the last three games of the season. Fowler ended the season collecting a hat-trick of awards at the club's end-of-season awards night, he was awarded the club's Player of the Year, Players' Player of the Year and the Golden Boot as top goal scorer.[89] On 15 June 2010, Fowler confirmed that he was taking legal action over the ending of his playing contract with North Queensland Fury. He was suing the Fury and Football Federation Australia, which took over the running of the club.[90]\n\nOn 27 April 2010, it was announced that Fowler had agreed to become part of Glory's squad for the 2010\u201311 A-League season.[91][92] Fowler reportedly ignored offers from Middle East clubs as well as Sydney FC to play in Perth. He joined the Glory for pre-season training in mid-June, following World Cup sponsorship commitments. Fowler scored his first goal for Perth on 29 August, a penalty against Melbourne Heart. He followed this up with a headed goal the following week against the Wellington Phoenix. In the following match, Fowler's hat-trick gave the Glory a 3\u20131 victory against Melbourne Victory at the Dairy Farmers Stadium in Townsville. Fowler ended the year as top scorer for the club.\n\nOn returning to England, Fowler briefly worked with League One side Milton Keynes Dons on an ad hoc basis to assist the club's coaching staff. On 7 April 2011, Bury confirmed that Fowler would join their coaching staff for a week to assist Richie Barker.[93] Fowler then briefly coached Liverpool's strikers in April 2011.\n\nOn 7 July 2011, Fowler agreed to play with Muangthong United, signing a one-year contract. In a press conference he stated that the weather conditions of Nonthaburi should not be a problem as he had played in Townsville and Perth. He was quickly a hit with Muangthong fans and the Thai public in general; he attended Thailand's World Cup Qualifier against Oman wearing the national team's shirt. He has since played a handful of scoreless games, both at the Yamaha Stadium and on the road in the AFC Cup, until the Twin Qilins were eliminated from the competition by Al-Kuwait. After the sacking of Henrique Calisto as head coach, Fowler was made player/coach.[94][95][96][97][98]\n\nOn 16 October 2011, after 250 minutes of play, Fowler scored his first goal for MTU against Chiangrai. He scored his 250th club career goal on 21 December 2011 against TTM Phichit. On 28 February 2012, Fowler announced he had left the club following Slavisa Jokanovic's appointment as coach.[99]\n\nOn 1 March 2012, Blackpool manager Ian Holloway confirmed that Fowler was training with the Seasiders and that he could earn a deal until the end of the season.[100] However, they could not agree a deal and Fowler decided against signing when Karl Oyston offered the striker \u00a3100 a week with \u00a35,000 for every first-team appearance.[101]\n\nOn 22 September 2012, Fowler announced that he is \"all but retired from professional football.\" He said this on the television show Soccer AM. In an interview in March 2013, he said that he was \"not officially retired\" and would \"jump at the opportunity to play again.\" Fowler has also stated in other interviews that he is currently[when?] completing his coaching licences. Fowler was on a six-man shortlist and interviewed for the vacant manager's job at Conference side Macclesfield Town in May 2013,[102] but caretaker manager John Askey was eventually appointed on a full-time basis.[103]\n\nFowler featured in Steven Gerrard's testimonial match against Olympiacos F.C. on 3 August 2013. He came off the bench in the 73rd minute to a warm reception[104] from Liverpool fans, but failed to score a goal.[105] On 21 April 2014, Fowler also featured in a charity match to commemorate the lives of the 96 Liverpool fans who died in the Hillsborough Disaster. Fowler scored both goals for his team in a 2\u20132 draw. On 2 January 2015, Fowler tweeted \"Gutted about Steven, but what an unbelievable player... I'm officially hanging my boots up as from now...A sad day for me\"[106] and so officially announced his retirement. In May 2016, it was revealed that Fowler would return to the pitch to play for England in Soccer Aid, a charity football match in aid of UNICEF, alongside Jamie Carragher.[107]\n\nFowler earned his first cap for England on 27 March 1996, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute in the 1\u20130 friendly win against Bulgaria at Wembley Stadium.[108] On 24 April, he won his second cap and made his first start for England in the 0\u20130 draw with Croatia.[109] Despite only having 3 caps to his name, England manager Terry Venables selected Fowler in his 22-man squad for Euro 1996.[110] Fowler went on to make two substitute appearances in the tournament, featuring in the 4\u20131 win against the Netherlands in the final group game,[111] and in the 0\u20130 draw against Spain in the quarter-finals, a game England won on penalties.[112]\n\nFowler did not feature during England's qualifying campaign for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, mainly due to a serious knee ligament injury late in the 1997\u201398 season,[113][114] and thus missed out on Glenn Hoddle's 22-man squad for the tournament.[115] He did, however, manage to score his first goal for his country on 29 March 1997, netting the second goal in a 2\u20130 friendly win against Mexico at Wembley Stadium.[116] A second goal followed in his next cap on 15 November, netting just before half-time in the 2\u20130 friendly win against Cameroon.[114][117]\n\nOn 9 June 1999, Fowler played in his first competitive game for England in nearly three years,[114] starting in the 1\u20131 draw with Bulgaria during Euro 2000 qualifying.[118] Kevin Keegan named Fowler in the preliminary squad for Euro 2000,[119] and after featuring in the three warm-up games against Brazil,[120] Ukraine,[121] and Malta,[122] he was named in the final squad on 1 June 2000.[123] Fowler did not play in the tournament as England were eliminated in the group stages.[114][124]\n\nFowler scored his fourth goal for England on 25 May 2001, netting the second goal in the 4\u20130 friendly win against Mexico at Pride Park, Derby.[125] On 5 September, he scored his first competitive goal for England in the 2\u20130 win against Albania at St James' Park, Newcastle.[126] This was during qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.[126] England qualified for the World Cup, and after scoring in friendlies against Italy[127] and Cameroon,[128] Fowler was selected in Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's 23-man squad for the tournament in South Korea and Japan.[129] He didn't appear in any of England's group matches,[114] but on 15 June 2002, he came on as a second-half substitute in the 3\u20130 win against Denmark in the Round of 16.[130] This turned out to be Fowler's last cap for his country.[114] He won a total of 26 caps for England and scored 7 goals.[114]\n\nOn 1 October 2011, Fowler was appointed as the manager of Muangthong United, where he was already an existing player.[94][95][96][97][98] Muangthong had taken action and sacked Henrique Calisto; a statement made by the club read, \"The board have appointed Robbie Fowler as the acting head coach and have terminated the contract of Portuguese boss Henrique Calisto. The contract is until the end of the season and the team must adapt to long-term goals if it is to succeed in Asia\", thus making Fowler player-manager.[94][95][96][97][98]\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that Fowler would be taking up a coaching role with Liverpool's academy.[131] On 9 September 2014, it was reported that Fowler had applied for the vacant managerial role at his former club Leeds United.[132][133]\n\nOn 23 April 2019, it was announced by Australian Hyundai A-League club Brisbane Roar that Fowler had signed a two-year contract to act as the club's new head coach ahead of the forthcoming 2019\u201320 season.[134][135] Upon his appointment, it was also announced that Tony Grant and Darren Davies would be joining his coaching staff, with Davies having acted as caretaker manager prior to Fowler's arrival.[136] To mark the managerial contrast, Brisbane announced a major clear-out during the off-season, where fourteen senior players were released, notably marquee player Eric Bautheac.[137][138] Fowler then made his first signing as a manager in June, when Roy O'Donovan signed from Newcastle United Jets.[139]\n\nFowler's first competitive match in charge came in a 2\u20130 thriller, which ended in Brisbane's favour against reigning A-League champions Sydney on 7 August in the FFA Cup.[140] Independently, Fowler won the league's Coach of the Month accolade for January and February 2020.[141][142] With play halted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic for the past three months, Fowler announced his decision to leave the club, stating that he was unwilling to be apart from his family; he and Grant had returned to England in March.[143]\n\nOn 9 October 2020, Indian Super League side East Bengal announced the signing of Fowler as their new manager.[144] Under him they collected seventeen points from first eighteen league fixtures and were placed ninth of eleven.[145] All India Football Federation's (AIFF) disciplinary committee issued a four-match ban and a substantial fine of \u20b95 lakh (US$6,300) against Fowler during the 2020\u201321 season, for involvement in a verbal disagreement with the match officials and league organizers after their match with FC Goa.[145]\n\nIn August 2022, having left East Bengal, Fowler was coaching at Oxford United \"on a casual basis\", according to manager Karl Robinson.[146]\n\nA prolific goal-scorer, Fowler was a quick and opportunistic striker, with good technical ability. Although naturally left-footed, he possessed an accurate, powerful shot from both inside and outside the area with both feet; he was also effective in the air.[147][148] Despite his reputation as a \"goal-poacher\", he was also a creative forward, capable of linking up well with other players, and laying off the ball to other strikers.[149][150] Despite his talent, he was also known to be injury-prone throughout his career.[151]\n\nIn his playing career, Fowler was sponsored by the sportswear company Nike, and appeared in Nike commercials.[152] In 1997 he starred in Nike's \"Park Life\" commercial (set to the tune \"Parklife\" by Blur) where a group of amateur pub league players playing football at Hackney Marshes in east London are suddenly joined by top Premier League footballers, including Fowler, Eric Cantona and Ian Wright.[152] In 2000, \"Park Life\" ranked number 15 in Channel 4's poll of the 100 Greatest TV Ads.[153]\n\nFowler married wife Kerrie on 9 June 2001 in the town of Duns, Scottish Borders in Scotland. Together they have three daughters[154] and one son. Their son, Jacob, signed a scholarship with Oxford United in August 2022.[155]\n\nFowler is a supporter of Liverpool F.C. and regularly attends matches at Anfield. He does media work for Abu Dhabi Sports Channel, Sky Sports and ITV.\n\nIn association with long-term friend Steve McManaman, Fowler has invested in several racehorses through their company The Macca and Growler Partnership, most notably 2003 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Celebration Chase runner-up Seebald.[156]\n\nOn 2 September 2005, Fowler released a book called Fowler: My Autobiography, about his time as a footballer and the issues surrounding him. Since his transfer to Liverpool, he has updated it and included a section about his return to Anfield. Excerpts published in newspapers included criticism of the England management.\n\nIn June 2008, Fowler participated alongside McManaman in Steve Nash and Claudio Reyna's Showdown in Chinatown, an 8-on-8 charity football game at Sara D. Roosevelt Park in Manhattan with McManaman making five of the goals, including one for Fowler.[157]\n\n\nIn 2019, Fowler featured in the first season of ITV show Harry's Heroes, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.[158]\n\nIn 2021 Fowler competed in the Legends Tour Celebrity Series of golf tournaments for charity. He won the Celebrity Series event at Formby near his native Liverpool in 2021[159] and competed at the Celebrity Series Grand Final in Mauritius in 2022, finishing second and winning a total of \u00a317,250 for charity over the 2021 season.[160]  He has previously held charity golf days to raise money for charities including The Ichthyosis Support Group.[161] Fowler's godson suffers from the rare genetic skin condition ichthyosis, for which there is no cure.\n\nFowler is a cousin of boxer and 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Anthony Fowler.[162]\n\nSources:[163][164]\n\nSources:[165][166]\n\nLiverpool\n\nEngland U18\n\nEngland U21\n\nIndividual\n\n\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Fowler"}, {"id": 100, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/105/2085149/original/stan-collymore-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Stan Collymore", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/stan-collymore/2085149", "desc": "Stanley Victor Collymore (born 22 January 1971) is an English former footballer who played as a centre-forward from 1990 to 2001.  He held the English transfer record when he moved from Nottingham Forest to Liverpool for \u00a38.5 million in 1995 and  was capped three times at senior level by the England national football team.  He is currently a football pundit.", "full_desc": "\n\nStanley Victor Collymore (born 22 January 1971) is an English football pundit, sport strategist, and former player who played as a striker from 1990 to 2001, most notably for Nottingham Forest and later Liverpool, who he joined from the former for an English transfer record of \u00a38.5 million in 1995. He is currently senior football strategist at Southend United.\n\nAfter his release from Wolves' academy, Collymore signed for non-league Stafford Rangers, where he caught the eye of First Division side Crystal Palace who signed him in January 1991. He failed to break into the first team and subsequently dropped down to the Second Division (renamed as the First Division in 1992) with Southend United, for whom his goalscoring record helped save from relegation and attract attention from Nottingham Forest, who he joined in the summer of 1993 for \u00a32.25 million. Collymore enjoyed two prolific seasons at Forest, earning promotion to the Premier League in his first season and scoring 22 goals as Forest finished in third place during the 1994-1995 season. Perennial title challengers Liverpool signed him in 1995, where he initially formed a successful partnership with Robbie Fowler, but was eventually ousted in favour of younger striker Michael Owen and sold on to boyhood club Aston Villa in 1997, where his form dipped and he struggled to break into the first team. After two unsuccessful years with Villa, he joined Leicester City in 2000 where he saw a brief career resurgence under Martin O'Neill, but struggled under his successor Peter Taylor and was sold to Bradford City in October 2000, but would leave the club after just 10 weeks due to his high wage bill. He then joined Real Oviedo of the Primera Liga, where he finished his career in March 2001 after just five weeks with the club.\n\nWhile a talented and prolific goalscorer, Collymore's career was often marred by controversy, including his public struggles with mental health, outbursts on the pitch and arguments with coaches and teammates.[1][2] During 2021, he became involved with the management of former club Southend United.\n\nCollymore was born at Groundslow Hospital, Tittensor, Staffordshire to a Barbadian father and English mother. He first took an interest in football as a child, and grew up supporting Aston Villa.[3][4] He started playing soon after as a centre forward for Cannock Peelers and Penkridge Juniors, before starting his professional career as an apprentice with Walsall, and later Wolverhampton Wanderers, before being released and signing for then Conference team, Stafford Rangers.\n\nWhile playing for Stafford Rangers, Collymore was spotted by a scout from First Division side Crystal Palace and signed with the club on 4 January 1991, when he was 19 years old. He made his first team debut for Palace on 23 April, coming on as a 76th minute substitute in a match against Liverpool. Collymore would remain with Palace for nearly two years, but struggled to find a place in the first team ahead of the prolific goalscoring partnership of Mark Bright and Ian Wright, and left the club in November 1992.\n\nCollymore joined First Division strugglers Southend United for \u00a3150,000 on 20 November 1992, as the club was stuck firmly in the second tier relegation battle with the likes of Birmingham, Oxford and Peterborough.[5] Collymore would score 15 goals in 30 league appearances that season, with his goalscoring record and form helping Southend to claw their way out of the bottom three and finish the season in 18th, after being tipped by many to be relegated at the start of the season.[6] Collymore later said \"I count helping to keep Southend in the First Division in my season there as one of my finest achievements.\"[7]\n\nCollymore's work at Southend attracted attention from a number of different teams, including boyhood club Aston Villa of the Premiership and newly relegated Nottingham Forest. Frank Clark eventually signed him to the latter on 5 July 1993 for an initial fee of \u00a32.25 million.[8][9][5] Collymore's prolific goalscoring form continued with Forest, as he scored 19 goals in 28 games and led the attack as Forest became a fixture in the top of the table and looked to win automatic promotion back to the Premiership. This was realised on 30 April 1994, when a last minute winner from Collymore saw Forest beat Peterborough United 3\u20132, securing a second place finish and automatic promotion to English football's top flight.[10]\n\nHe made his first appearance for Forest in the Premiership on 22 August 1994, scoring a 26th minute equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw against Manchester United at City Ground.[11] Collymore scored 22 goals as Forest remained a consistent challenger for a top 3 finish in 1994\u201395, and a thirteen game unbeaten run from February\u2013May saw them finish third and earn a place in the next season's UEFA Cup. Despite success on the field, Collymore became an unpopular figure among his teammates, to the point that they refused to celebrate with him when he scored a goal.[12] Midway through the season, his impressive goalscoring record had attracted attention from Manchester United, who were looking to replace ageing striker Mark Hughes with a younger talent. Collymore spent almost the entirety of late 1994 linked with a move to Old Trafford, with himself and Newcastle United's Andy Cole named as Sir Alex Ferguson\u2018s most wanted targets. Eventually, Cole was signed by United for an English transfer record deal worth \u00a37 million, while Collymore stayed at Forest for the remainder of the season; by the end of the campaign, however, he had received offers from Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle, with all three battling to earn his signature in the summer of 1995.[13][14][5]\n\nRoy Evans would sign the deal to bring Collymore to Liverpool on 3 July 1995 for \u00a38.5 million, shattering the English transfer record set earlier in the year by Andy Cole's move to Manchester United. Collymore was initially placed in a forward partnership with veteran Ian Rush, though Rush was soon replaced with the younger Robbie Fowler early in the season. The up front pairing of Collymore and Fowler proved to be successful, as they scored a combined 55 goals in 1995/96 and established Evans' Liverpool side as serious contenders for that year's Premiership trophy.[5] On 3 April 1996, with the title still very much up for grabs, Liverpool met league leaders Newcastle in a thrilling 4-3 win at Anfield, with Collymore scoring the winner in the second minute of stoppage time to severely weaken Newcastle's grip on first place and eventually play a part in them falling to second as Manchester United would take the trophy on the final day. This was later voted as the best match of the decade by the Premier League in 2003.[15][5] Along with a strong league finish, Collymore was part of the Liverpool side that reached the 1996 FA Cup Final, played against Manchester United on 11 May 1996. Though he started the game, Collymore failed to get on the scoresheet and was subbed off in the 74th minute for Ian Rush, in what went on to be Rush's final appearance for the club. Collymore watched from the sidelines as Eric Cantona fired home the winning goal with five minutes left on the clock, consigning Liverpool to another year with no major silverware. It would be the closest that Collymore would come to winning a major trophy in his playing career.\n\nExpectations were high for Liverpool and the Collymore/Fowler partnership the following season after the promise they had showed in the previous campaign. Roy Evans' exciting young squad led the league for much of the first half of the season, but a series of poor performances in early 1997 saw them fall behind winners Manchester United and eventually finish 4th.[16] Collymore was again a regular fixture in the attack and was a consistent goalscorer and creator, but became the subject of increasing media scrutiny throughout the season, as tabloids accused him and most of his teammates of being unprofessional, with the squad being dubbed the \"Spice Boys\" by newspapers in 1997.[5][17] He eventually fell out of favour with Evans, and was gradually replaced with the up-and-coming Michael Owen towards the end of the season. As his starts for Liverpool became more sporadic, rumours of his departure from Anfield began to circulate prior to the summer.\n\nRumours of his exit from Liverpool were confirmed on 16 May 1997 when Collymore was signed by boyhood club Aston Villa for a club record \u00a37 million. Collymore debuted for the Villans on 9 August 1997 in a 1\u20130 loss to Leicester City. He scored his first club goal on 27 August, in a 3\u20132 loss against Tottenham. On 4 October, he was sent off after getting into a fistfight with Bolton Wanderers' Andy Todd and subsequently handed a three match ban by the F.A.[18][19] His debut season for Villa coincided with a major dip in form, as well as injury and disciplinary problems, as he managed just 6 goals all season and struggled to break into the starting lineup ahead of longtime main striker Dwight Yorke. During a match against Liverpool on 28 February 1998, Collymore accused former teammate Steve Harkness of racist abuse, an incident that was later picked up by the Professional Footballer's Association (PFA), but went unresolved and was closed after both players met in private and agreed to move on without charges.[20][21][22] Off the field, Collymore was involved in an incident on 9 June 1998 where he assaulted girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in a Paris bar, which he later apologised for.[23][24][25][26]\n\nThe 1998\u201399 season saw Collymore score just once in 19 appearances, as his issues off the field came to a head. In a match against Liverpool on 20 November 1998, Collymore was given a yellow card for a 9th minute tackle on defender Steve Harkness that caused the latter to be carried off the pitch and suffer ligament damage; Collymore was later shown a second yellow and sent off for another rash challenge on Michael Owen. Given his history with Harkness, Collymore was accused of holding a grudge and purposely trying to injure his former teammate; he denied the allegations.[27] Shortly after this, he began to publicly struggle with his mental health, and was diagnosed with clinical depression, stress and anxiety in January 1999. Following this, he announced he would seek counselling and checked himself into the Priory Group Hospital in Roehampton, where he stayed for several weeks. He returned to the Villa side later in the season, but after a 3\u20130 loss to Chelsea on 21 March 1999, manager John Gregory dropped him from the first team for the rest of the season. This would go on to be his last appearance for Aston Villa.[28][29]\n\nAfter a summer move to Greek side Panathinaikos failed to materialise, Collymore was sent out on a three month loan to Fulham at the start of the 1999\u20132000 season, with an option for the club to sign him for \u00a31 million at the end. While he failed to make a major impact and was not signed, he did score the winner in a 2\u20131 League Cup win over West Bromwich Albion on 12 October 1999.[30][18]\n\nCollymore and Aston Villa mutually agreed to separate after he returned from his loan spell at Fulham, and he spent the rest of 1999 training with the youth team and looking for a new club. Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier HSC showed interest, but rescinded their offer after Collymore refused to play in a practice match before signing. Newly promoted Bradford City also tried and failed to sign him, put off by Villa's \u00a33 million asking price.[18] He eventually joined Leicester City for free on a pay-as-you-play basis on 11 February 2000. Just days after signing for the club, he made front page news during a team break in Spain, when he set off a fire extinguisher during a night of drinking inside La Manga Club, which resulted in \u00a3700 of damage to the bar and the entire team being sent home. Collymore was fined \u00a330,000 and ordered to undertake community work by boss Martin O'Neill for the incident; O'Neill also warned Collymore that he would terminate his contract if any more incidents like this would occur.[18][31][32][33][34] After returning to England, his second appearance and home debut for the club saw him score a hat-trick in a 5\u20132 drubbing of Sunderland. He would score 4 times in 6 appearances in his debut campaign for the Foxes, a season that saw them reach the League Cup Final, where they defeated Tranmere Rovers 2\u20131, though Collymore, having turned out for Fulham earlier in the season, was cup-tied and unable to feature.[35] Collymore was stretchered off the pitch during a game against Derby County on 2 April after just 17 minutes, having audibly screamed and collapsed in the middle of the pitch. Scans later revealed he had suffered a broken left leg after an awkward landing, and he missed the rest of the season.[36]\n\nHaving fully recovered, Collymore remained with Leicester through the summer transfer window and was thought to be the club's new first choice striker after Emile Heskey had left for Liverpool in the summer; however, with Martin O'Neill having departed Leicester to manage Celtic, he was dropped by replacement manager Peter Taylor in favour of new signing Ade Akinbiyi and instead often brought on as a midfield substitute. He scored once more for the Foxes, in a 2\u20130 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 17 September 2000.[37] On 24 September, during a 1\u20131 draw against Everton, Collymore was alleged to have \"stamped on, and later elbowed\" Paul Gascoigne.[38][39] While referee Alan Wiley claimed he did not see the incident and Collymore wasn\u2019t punished during the game, he was later ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing by the FA on 28 November.[40][38][41] Two days after the incident with Gascoigne, Collymore submitted a transfer request to Leicester.[42] He would later retract this request, but manager Peter Taylor still placed him on the transfer list, citing Collymore's poor fitness, lack of commitment and attitude problems.[43][44] Having fallen out of favour with another manager, and demoted to the reserve squad, where he was involved in a half time altercation with teammate Trevor Benjamin,[45][46] Collymore and Leicester would eventually agree to part ways, and he was allowed to leave on a free transfer in October 2000.[12][43]\n\nCollymore was immediately signed by longtime admirers Bradford City on 26 October 2000, a move described as \"desperate\" by BBC Sport pundit Mark Lawrenson.[47] He made his Bradford debut in a West Yorkshire derby against Leeds United at Valley Parade on 29 October, scoring a memorable overhead kick in a 1\u20131 draw, however, his controversial celebration in front of the away crowd caused uproar and led to two Leeds fans being restrained by stewards. Collymore subsequently faced additional charges from the F.A. for the incident.[48][49][50] He was substituted at half-time in his second game as Bradford lost 4\u20133 to Newcastle United in the League Cup,[51] and missed the following game at Charlton Athletic because of flu and a sore wisdom tooth.[52] In Collymore's absence, City lost 2\u20130, and manager Chris Hutchings was sacked two days later.[53] Jim Jefferies soon took over as new City manager, and Collymore once again led the front line in Jefferies' first home game in charge against Coventry City, scoring Bradford's first goal.[54] On 28 November, he attended a disciplinary hearing for the incident with Paul Gascoigne while he was still at Leicester, and upon video review of the incident, he was handed a three match ban, which meant he would miss key games against Liverpool, Sunderland and Chelsea.[18] After returning from his ban, Collymore, and other highly paid players Benito Carbone and Dan Petrescu were transfer-listed in January 2001 by chairman Geoffrey Richmond in a bid to reduce the club's high wage bill. VFB Stuttgart and Celtic both made offers for Collymore, but he would eventually choose to sign with Spanish outfit Real Oviedo after just 8 games and 10 weeks with Bradford.[55][56][57][58]\n\nCollymore signed an 18 month contract with Primera Liga side Real Oviedo on 31 January 2001.[56] He made his debut for Oviedo as a second-half substitute in a 1-0 defeat to Las Palmas on 4 February 2001.[59] He was again brought on during the second half of his home debut a week later in a loss against Villarreal, but was dropped by coach Radomir Anti\u0107 after the game and told to improve his fitness.[60] He played just one more game for Oviedo, another loss against Celta Vigo on 3 March, before announcing his retirement on 7 March 2001 at the age of 30, just five weeks after he had joined Oviedo; he did not tell the club of his plans beforehand and they only found out through the Spanish tabloids. A statement issued through his spokesman said, \"Stan Collymore has decided, after discussions with his family and close friends, to give up playing professional football. He has just turned 30 and believes that the time is right to explore other career opportunities which are available to him.\"[61] He was offered a chance to return to Southend United[62] and was also approached by Boston United and Wolverhampton Wanderers,[63] but never made a return to football, however, he applied but was turned down for the manager's position at Bradford City following the dismissal of Jim Jefferies in December 2001.[64] Before the end of the year, Oviedo had begun court proceedings against Collymore for breach of his contract, unsuccessfully suing him for \u00a37 million.[65][66]\n\nAfter an impressive debut season in the Premier League, Collymore was called up to Terry Venables' England squad for the Umbro Cup in June 1995. He made his d\u00e9but at Wembley Stadium against Japan, partnering Alan Shearer in a 2\u20131 win.[67] He won his second cap as a 90th minute substitute against Brazil.[68]\n\nCollymore made his third and final appearance for England as a substitute in a 4\u20130 win over Moldova during qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.[68]\n\nCollymore contributed to his biography Stan: Tackling my demons with Oliver Holt.[69] In 2005, he played the character Kevin Franks in the film Basic Instinct 2 alongside Sharon Stone.[70]\n\nOn 20 October 2008, Collymore won more than \u00a31.5 million in damages from his financial advisers, for the poor investment advice he had been given since retiring from professional football in 2001. The judge ruled that Collymore had been given advice that was in breach of statutory obligations.[71]\n\nCollymore worked as a football pundit and presenter on the TalkSport radio station for eight years between 2008 and 2016.[72] He also worked as a commentator for BT Sport, he was released from his contract in 2015 for criticising their lack of action regarding sectarian chanting during a game between Rangers and Raith Rovers.[73] He writes a column for caughtoffside.com.\n\nIn April 2021, Collymore wrote to Southend United chairman Ron Martin offering to buy the club from him,[74] and held talks concerning the potential appointment of a Collymore associate as the club's CEO;[75] in May, Tom Lawrence was appointed.[76]\n\nIn October, Collymore, Martin, Lawrence and director Gary Lockett formed a panel to appoint a new club manager following the sacking of Phil Brown.[77] Collymore offered further free support, as the club was described as \"a mess\" by the BBC,[78] and Lawrence started negotiations with Collymore about a formal role with the club.[79] Collymore was announced as the club's senior football strategist on 4 November 2021.[80]\n\nCollymore has talked openly about his mental health issues. He began to seek counselling after he was diagnosed with clinical depression, stress and anxiety in 1999 while playing for Aston Villa. He also stated in his autobiography that he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.[81] Since retiring, he has continued to struggle with depression, and uses his Twitter account to raise awareness of the condition.[82][2]\n\nHe is a supporter of Republic, a campaign group that campaigns for an elected UK head of state.[83][failed verification] He supported the Labour Party before leaving them for the Scottish National Party in December 2015 after a notable minority of Labour MPs supported airstrikes in Syria.[84]\n\nIn early 1998, Collymore was accused of assault by the mother of his child, Michelle Green; she alleged he had punched her in the face and caused injury after an argument regarding their son on 22 December 1997. Collymore denied the accusations, and was found not guilty and cleared of any charges at a court hearing on 28 April 1998.[85] Around the same time, he was in a relationship with television personality Ulrika Jonsson, which ended after he assaulted her in a Paris bar on 9 June 1998. He later apologised for the incident.[23][24][25][26]\n\nCollymore made front page news in February 2000 while playing for Leicester City, when, during a team break in Spain, he set off a fire extinguisher during a night of drinking inside La Manga Club which resulted in the entire team being sent home and banned from the resort.

He also had spells with Ban\u00edk Ostrava, where he started his career, and English club Aston Villa, before retiring from professional football in 2020 following the fourth spell at Ban\u00edk Ostrava.\n\nBorn in Vala\u0161sk\u00e9 Mezi\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed, Baro\u0161 represented the Czech Republic international team in 93 matches, scoring on 41 occasions. He won the Golden Boot as top scorer of the Euro 2004 tournament, where his nation reached the semi-finals. He went on to play in three more major international tournaments. His 41 goals for the Czech Republic is second behind only Jan Koller.\n\nAs a boy, Baro\u0161 played for youth clubs in Vigantice and Ro\u017enov pod Radho\u0161t\u011bm before joining the youth team of Ban\u00edk Ostrava at the age of 12.[3] In 1998, he made his debut for the club in the Czech First League, the top division of Czech football, becoming a regular over the next few seasons.[4] In 2000, he won the Talent of the Year award at the Czech Footballer of the Year awards.[5] He was described by the Czech News Agency in the 2000\u201301 season as \"perhaps the biggest star of the [Czech] football league\".[6] He played his last game for the club on 2 December 2001, in a 1\u20130 loss at Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov.[7] During his time in Ostrava, he scored 23 league goals in 76 appearances.[7]\n\nBaro\u0161 joined Liverpool in 2002 in a transfer worth \u00a33.2 million,[8] although he did not move straight away due to delays in obtaining a work permit for him.[9] He made his club debut in a UEFA Champions League tie away to Barcelona on 13 March;[citation needed] he played the last 16 minutes in place of Emile Heskey as the match finished goalless.[10] It was his only appearance of the 2001\u201302 season.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2002\u201303 season, Baro\u0161 scored twice on his Premiership debut away to Bolton Wanderers on 14 September 2002, as Liverpool won 3\u20132 away.[11] Baro\u0161 was a substitute in the 2003 Football League Cup Final against Manchester United. He entered the game in the second half, but did not play to the end of the game, being substituted himself a minute before the end of the game.[12] Liverpool won the game 2\u20130 to win the cup, the first major trophy of Baro\u0161' career.[12] Towards the end of the season, he scored twice in a 6\u20130 away win over already-relegated West Bromwich Albion in April 2003.[13] He ended his first season in the Premiership with 12 goals for the club.\n\nBaro\u0161 broke his ankle in a September 2003 match against Blackburn Rovers, a match which also saw teammate Jamie Carragher sustain a broken leg.[14] Baro\u0161 subsequently missed five months of football and scored just two goals in the 2003\u201304 season.[15] His first goal came in a league match against Leeds United in February 2004,[16] while his other goal was in March in a 1\u20131 Champions League draw against Marseille.[17] Baro\u0161 would later claim that had manager G\u00e9rard Houllier stayed at the club after the summer of 2004, he would have put in a transfer request.[15] As it was, Houllier left the club and was replaced by Rafael Ben\u00edtez.[18]\n\nBaro\u0161 entered the 2004\u201305 season having been the top goalscorer in the summer's Euro 2004[19] tournament. With Michael Owen and Emile Heskey having been sold and new signing Djibril Ciss\u00e9 out with a long-term injury, Baro\u0161 was now Liverpool's only senior striker.[19] Despite being the club's joint top scorer with 13 goals, including a hat-trick against Crystal Palace,[20] Spaniard Fernando Morientes was preferred to Baro\u0161 in Liverpool's starting lineup for the League Cup Final, a match they lost to Chelsea.[21] However, he did start the 2005 Champions League Final, being substituted after 85 minutes as the game finished 3\u20133 in normal time.[22] Liverpool went on to win the match on penalties. Baro\u0161 reportedly dropped the trophy during the team's celebration, leaving a dent, but Liverpool decided not to mend it because it \"added to the character\" of the trophy.[23] He finished the season with 13 goals, becoming the joint-top scorer for the club.[24] Baro\u0161 also received his first red card during the campaign, being sent off for a high challenge on Everton's Alan Stubbs in the Merseyside derby on 20 March.[25]\n\nIn June 2005, former manager G\u00e9rard Houllier, then with French club Lyon, made an approach to sign Baro\u0161. The player rejected the approach,[26] but only made two substitute appearances for Liverpool in the 2005\u201306 season before leaving the club. He left Liverpool with league figures of 19 goals in 68 appearances.[27]\n\nBaro\u0161 moved to Premiership side Aston Villa for a fee of \u00a36.5 million in August 2005, signing a four-year contract.[24] He was given the number 10 shirt.[28] Just ten minutes into his Aston Villa debut, he scored the only goal in his new team's league victory over Blackburn.[29] He played a crucial role in Villa's League Cup second round victory against Wycombe Wanderers in September.[30] With Villa trailing 3\u20131 at half time, Baro\u0161 scored shortly after the beginning of the second half and won a penalty, which Gareth Barry converted.[30] He also provided the cross for Barry's second goal of the game as Villa scored seven goals in the second half, resulting in a final score of 8\u20133, their biggest win in over 40 years.[30] He set up the first Aston Villa goal in a November match against Sunderland in dubious circumstances; back-heeling the ball, which \"looked to have gone out of play\" to Aaron Hughes.[31] Hughes' pass found Kevin Phillips, who opened the scoring against his old club. He later scored a goal himself in the same game, which ended 3\u20131 to Villa.[31]\n\nIn the Boxing Day match against Everton, Baro\u0161 was involved thoroughly in the proceedings. He opened the scoring in the 35th minute, having handled the ball immediately beforehand.[32] This was not punished and the referee awarded a goal.[32] Baro\u0161 subsequently celebrated in front of the travelling Everton fans, making a gesture as if to listen to them.[33] A number of missiles from the crowd were subsequently thrown in Baro\u0161' direction.[33] The goal was just his third in what Glenn Moore of The Independent described as \"an indifferent season\" for Baro\u0161.[34] He went on to score his second goal of the game, and Villa's fourth, earning him man of the match honours.[34] Baro\u0161 scored twice in January 2006's fourth round FA Cup win against Port Vale,[35] and added another in the following round's 1\u20131 draw with Manchester City.[36] Late in the season, he scored two goals in the Second City derby against Birmingham City at Villa Park, marking his 11th and 12th goals of the season and winning another man of the match award.[37] He would score no further goals that season.\n\nBaro\u0161 failed to score at the start of the 2006\u201307 season, leading new manager Martin O'Neill to challenge him in October to prove himself before the January transfer window.[38] He subsequently scored his first goal of the season in December 2006, eight months since scoring his last one, with a close-range equaliser against Sheffield United in a 2\u20132 draw.[39] Although he also managed to score for Aston Villa in a 2\u20131 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup,[40] he left the club in January 2007, having scored just once in 17 league matches that season.[41]\n\nOn 22 January 2007, Baro\u0161 signed with French side Lyon, signing a three-and-a-half year contract and reuniting with former manager G\u00e9rard Houllier from his time at Liverpool.[42] The deal swapped Baro\u0161 with Lyon striker John Carew, who joined Aston Villa on a three-and-a-half-year deal.[43] Just two days after joining the club, he made his Lyon debut in a league match against Bordeaux. He appeared as a substitute, as league leaders Lyon lost 2\u20131 for their first home defeat of the season.[44] Baro\u0161 took part in that year's Champions League, featuring as a substitute in a 0\u20130 draw in Rome against Roma.[45] He played no further part in that season's Champions League campaign, as he remained on the bench in the return leg as Lyon were eliminated.[46]\n\nIn May 2007, Baro\u0161 was accused of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian opponent St\u00e9phane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April.[47] After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baro\u0161 held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant smell.[47] In the ensuing controversy, Baro\u0161 insisted that his gesture was not intended to be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone.[47] Baro\u0161 and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baro\u0161 was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct.[47] The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.[48]\n\nBaro\u0161 scored in Lyon's opening game of the 2007\u201308 season as his club won 2\u20130 against Auxerre.[49] However, he played significantly less under new manager Alain Perrin, making just six starts and scoring a total of three league goals.[50] In mid-November, Baro\u0161 revealed a break down in his relationship with Perrin and hinted at a move to another club.[51]\n\nBaro\u0161 joined Premier League side Portsmouth on loan from Lyon in January 2008 until the end of the season, with the option of making the move permanent at the end of the loan.[50] Baro\u0161 played a significant role in the club winning the 2008 FA Cup. He won Portsmouth's match-winning penalty kick in the quarter-final at Manchester United and assisted Nwankwo Kanu's deciding goal in the semi final match against West Bromwich Albion with a suspected handball that went unnoticed by both the referee and his assistant.[52][53] The final match of Baro\u0161' loan spell was the 2008 FA Cup Final victory over Cardiff City at Wembley Stadium, where he appeared as an 87th-minute substitute for Kanu.[54] By the end of the season, Baro\u0161 had played 16 matches for Portsmouth, including seven as a substitute, although he failed to score.[54] He was one of a number of Portsmouth players to be absent at the team parade after the club won the FA Cup, leading to speculation he could have played his last game for the club.[55] At the end of the season, Baro\u0161 returned to Lyon.[56]\n\nIn August 2008, Baro\u0161 joined Turkish champions Galatasaray from Lyon for a fee of \u20ac4.7 million.[56][57] He made his first appearance against Kayserispor, playing the last 15 minutes. Baro\u0161 scored his first two goals for the club in the UEFA Cup first round, first leg game against Bellinzona.[58] Three days later, in his first league start, he once again scored two goals against Kocaelispor, with Galatasaray going on to win the match 4\u20131.[59] On 21 December 2008, Baro\u0161 scored a hat-trick in the 4\u20132 S\u00fcper Lig derby win against Be\u015fikta\u015f, converting two penalties and scoring one from open play.[60] He scored another hat-trick later in the season against Hacettepe.[61] He finished the 2008\u201309 season as the S\u00fcper Lig top scorer with 20 goals.[62]\n\nBaro\u0161 scored his first goal of the 2009\u201310 season in his third league game when he scored twice in a 4\u20131 win against Kayserispor.[63] His next two goals came on 13 September where Galatasaray played rivals Be\u015fikta\u015f. Galatasaray won the match 3\u20130, with Baro\u0161 scoring his third and fourth goals of the season.[64] He scored a total of five times in ten matches before breaking his left foot in two places after a tackle by Emre Bel\u00f6zo\u011flu in the Fenerbah\u00e7e\u2013Galatasaray derby on 25 October 2009.[65] He returned to action four and a half months later on 14 March 2010 for a game against Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc, scoring a goal on his comeback.[66] During the season, he scored his third hat-trick for the club in a match against Diyarbakirspor.[61] He finished the season with league figures of 11 goals in 17 matches.[67]\n\nIn August 2010, a week before the start of the 2010\u201311 S\u00fcper Lig, he extended his contract with Galatasaray for two seasons, keeping him contracted to the club until the end of the 2012\u201313 season.[67] Although he had been injured during pre-season training,[67] Baro\u0161 appeared as a substitute in his club's UEFA Europa League qualification match against Karpaty Lviv, scoring twice as Galatasaray returned from 2\u20130 down to draw the match.[68] At the end of September, he scored his fourth hat-trick for the club against Istanbul B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir Belediyespor, although he failed to complete the game due to an injury.[61] He scored two more goals in a 4\u20132 loss against Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc on 17 October, but was injured again.[69] Baro\u0161 was suspended for three matches in March 2011 after insulting referee F\u0131rat Ayd\u0131nus in a match against Be\u015fikta\u015f.[70] By the end of the season, Baro\u0161 had appeared in 17 league games and scored 9 goals.[71]\n\nGalatasaray started the 2011\u201312 season well and were top of the league in January, having won eight consecutive league matches.[72] Baro\u0161 did not start a match for his club for four weeks,[73] but scored an important goal against Samsunspor in the eighth match of the streak.[72] The club won a ninth-straight game, with Baro\u0161 scoring his seventh goal of the season, in the 5\u20131 win against Kardemir Karab\u00fckspor, although he left the game with an injury.[74] He returned from injury in a February match against Antalyaspor, coming on as a substitute, but was on the field of play just 15 minutes before receiving a red card.[75] His dismissal resulted in a three-match suspension.[76] Baro\u0161 scored his last goal for the club in April 2012 in the last match of the regular season against Manisaspor.[77]\n\nIn 2012, Baro\u0161 was told by then-coach Fatih Terim that he would not play for the club any more.[78] He played no competitive football after Euro 2012 and finally left the club in February 2013.[7]\n\nOn 18 February 2013, Czech club Ban\u00edk Ostrava announced that Baro\u0161 had rejoined the club where he started his career, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract.[79] Under the terms of the contract, his salary was donated to support the youth club of the team.[7] Having not played a competitive match since 21 June of the previous year,[7] he played his first match of the season on 23 February, coming on as a substitute in the 0\u20130 home draw with Dynamo \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice.[80] He scored a hat-trick in Ostrava's 3\u20130 league victory against Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 on 9 March 2013, his first hat-trick in the top flight of Czech football.[81]\n\nOn 16 July 2013, Baro\u0161 agreed a one-year contract with Turkish club Antalyaspor.[82] He made his club debut in August, appearing as a substitute in a 0\u20130 S\u00fcper Lig draw against Kayseri Erciyesspor.[83] He scored his first goal for Antalyaspor against Bursaspor in August, then his second against Rizespor in October.[84] He suffered damage to his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in December 2013, ruling him out of action for the rest of the season. Baro\u0161 returned to the Czech Republic for treatment in January 2014.[85]\n\n24 September 2014 saw Baro\u0161 re-join Ostrava; he signed a contract until the end of the 2014\u201315 season.[86] Following the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Baro\u0161 left Ostrava and signed a two-year contract with Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav.[87] Following the end of the 2015\u201316 season, Baro\u0161 left Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav and signed a two-year contract with Slovan Liberec.[88] He only spent one of the two years at Liberec before returning to Ban\u00edk Ostrava in 2017.[89] On 3 July 2020, 38-year-old Baro\u0161 announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of the Czech season, due to persistent injuries.[90]\n\nBaro\u0161 started representing the Czech Republic in 1997, at under-15 level.[4] Over the next three years he moved up to play at higher age groups, specifically under-16, 17 and 18.[4] Baro\u0161 played in the 2000 Olympic tournament, making three appearances for the team.[4] He took part in two other major tournaments at junior level: the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, at which the Czech Republic placed second, and the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, which the Czech Republic won.[4]\n\nBaro\u0161 made his first appearance for the senior national side on 25 April 2001 in a friendly match against Belgium,[91] scoring on his debut.[92] Baro\u0161 and national teammate Pavel Nedv\u011bd were both shown the red card in a November 2001 qualification match for the following year's World Cup, as the Czech Republic were eliminated by Belgium.[93]\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2004, Baro\u0161 scored the first goal for the Czech Republic in their first game of the tournament, a come-from-behind 2\u20131 victory over Latvia.[94] With the goal he became the youngest goalscorer at the European Championships for the Czech Republic.[94] His second goal of the tournament came against the Netherlands; the Dutch team had taken a two-goal lead over the Czechs before Jan Koller scored from a Baro\u0161 pass.[95] Baro\u0161 then scored before Vladim\u00edr \u0160micer completed the scoring, as the Czechs won the game 3\u20132.[95] The third group match saw the Czech Republic make nine changes to their starting lineup, having already qualified for the quarter-finals.[96] Baro\u0161 appeared as a substitute and scored the winning goal, as opponents Germany failed to advance to the next stage of the tournament.[96] Baro\u0161 added two goals in two minutes of the second half of the Czechs' quarter-final win over Denmark,[97] and finished as the tournament's Golden Boot winner with five goals.[98]\n\nIn qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Baro\u0161 scored five goals for his country, including four in consecutive matches in 2005.[99] An injury to his foot, picked up in a match on 3 June, kept him out of 2006 FIFA World Cup games against the United States and Ghana.[100] He did appear in the Czechs' final group game against Italy,[101] but appeared unfit and left the game after 64 minutes to be replaced by David Jarol\u00edm.[102][103]\n\nIn the run up to UEFA Euro 2008, Baro\u0161 had not scored an international goal since March 2007.[27] He started the Czech Republic's second group game against Portugal, but Portugal won 3\u20131 and Baro\u0161 failed to score.[27] Jan Koller was preferred to Baro\u0161 in the starting lineup for the next match, against Turkey.[104] Despite neither playing in the match nor even being on the pitch, Baro\u0161 suffered the indignity of receiving a yellow card during stoppage time at the end of the match.[104]\n\nBaro\u0161 was banned indefinitely from playing for his national side in April 2009 after a breach of discipline, having attended a bar late at night.[105] However, he was recalled to the national side after the appointment of Ivan Ha\u0161ek as head coach.[106] On 12 August 2009, he marked his return to international duty with a goal from the penalty spot in the 3\u20131 home win against Belgium in a friendly match.[107] The following month, Baro\u0161 scored a career high of four goals against San Marino, in a World Cup qualifier which the Czech Republic won 7\u20130.[108] In doing so, he became only the second player from the Czech Republic to score four goals in an international match.[108] He was selected as part of the squad for Euro 2012. After the tournament, during which he failed to score, Baro\u0161 announced his retirement from international football, having scored a total of 41 international goals in 93 matches.[109] His total of 41 international goals for his country is second only to strike partner Jan Koller, who holds the record with 55.[7]\n\nBaro\u0161 gained the nickname \"the Ostravan Maradona\" in his native Czech Republic due to perceived similarities with the Argentine footballer of the same name.[110] He was noted particularly for being a quick player with good dribbling skill.[91]\n\nBaro\u0161 was born in the Czech town of Vala\u0161sk\u00e9 Mezi\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed.[12] He is of partial Romani descent. He grew up in the village of Vigantice.[111] In 2009, he married Tereza Frankov\u00e1,[112] whom he started dating in 2005.[113] Their son Patrik was born on 1 September 2009.[114]\n\nOn 1 November 2007, Baro\u0161 was arrested in France while driving at 271\u00a0km/h (168\u00a0mph) in his black Ferrari F430, on a freeway limited to 130\u00a0km/h (81\u00a0mph). Stopped by French police between Lyon and Geneva in the region of Ain, the local authorities said the radar reading of 271\u00a0km/h was the fastest speed ever recorded in the region, surpassing the previous mark of 248\u00a0km/h (154\u00a0mph) set by a motorcyclist in 2000. As a result, Baro\u0161 had his car and licence confiscated and had to return to Lyon in a taxi.[115]\n\nSource: League matches;[116]Cup and League Cup matches;[117]Liverpool European matches;[118]European club matches from 2006[71]\n\n\nBaro\u0161 made his debut opposed to Belgium in April 2001,[119] netting his first goal as the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw.[120]  Baro\u0161 has only scored a hat-trick once, which came against San Marino in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match in September 2009,[121] where he accomplished a career mark by scoring four times.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiverpool\n\nOlympique Lyon\n\nPortsmouth\n\nGalatasaray\n\nMlad\u00e1 Boleslav\n\nCzech Republic Youth\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan_Baro%C5%A1"}, {"id": 103, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/549/10967936/original/alan-dzagoev-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Alan Dzagoev", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/alan-dzagoev/10967936", "desc": "Alan Yelizbarovich Dzagoev (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0431\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0414\u0437\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0435\u0432, pronounced [\u0250\u02c8lan j\u026al\u02b2\u026a\u02c8zbar\u0259v\u02b2\u026at\u0255 dz\u0250\u02c8go(j)\u026af]; Ossetian: \u0414\u0437\u00e6\u0433\u044a\u043e\u0439\u0442\u044b \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0431\u0430\u0440\u044b \u0444\u044b\u0440\u0442 \u0410\u043b\u0430\u043d; romanized as Dzagoyev; born 17 June 1990) is a Russian international footballer who plays as a central midfielder for PFC CSKA Moscow and the Russia national football team.\nAfter joining Akademiya Tolyatti in 2006, he remained there for two seasons before transferring to CSKA Moscow.

Following a successful debut season in the Russian Premier League, he won the award for Best Young Player in the league and made his way into the Russian national team. He is regarded as a star in his native North Ossetia.[2]\n\nDzagoev has won 3 Russian Premier League titles and 4 Russian Cups.\n\nA full international for Russia since 2008, he was the joint top scorer at UEFA Euro 2012 and also played at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\nDzagoev (born Zagoshvili[3]), the younger of two sons of Yelizbar (who is commonly referred to as Tariel) and Lyana, was born and raised in Beslan, North Ossetia\u2013Alania, to which his family, ethnic Ossetians from Georgia,[2] moved in 1989.[4] He played football on the streets with his brother Gela right up to the second grade of elementary school, when their mother, a passionate football fan, brought them to the Terek Beslan youth team.[5]\n\nIn 2000, Dzagoev moved to Vladikavkaz to play for a local youth team, Yunost. As their team used to attend Alania Vladikavkaz matches, he became their fan. He describes Valery Gazzaev, an Ossetic footballing legend who later became his coach at CSKA Moscow, as his childhood hero, also stating that Evgeni Aldonin and Frank Lampard were role models for him.[5]\n\nIn July 2005, Dzagoev joined the Konoplyov football academy.[6]\n\nIn July 2012, Dzagoev married Zarema Abayeva, who is originally from North Ossetia-Alania's capital, Vladikavkaz.[7] They have two children - Elana (born 2013) and Khetag (born 2016).[8][9]\n\nFrom January 2006 to December 2007, Dzagoev played for Akademiya Tolyatti, formerly known as Krylia Sovetov-SOK, of the Russian Second Division. He made his professional debut on 29 April 2006 in a 1\u20132 home defeat against Tyumen.[10] He appeared in 37 matches and scored six goals for the team.[citation needed]\n\nDzagoev signed for CSKA Moscow before the start of the 2008 Russian Premier League season.[11] His first appearance was as a substitute in a match against Luch. A couple of games later, he appeared in the starting lineup in the home match against FC Khimki and managed to score a goal and two assists. He was also a starter when the team won the 2008 Russian Cup final. In the round 13 game against bitter rivals Spartak Moscow, Dzagoev made three assists, helping CSKA to secure a 5\u20131 victory and since then he has become an undisputed member of the first eleven. Dzagoev was also the man of the match when he scored two goals in a 1\u20133 away victory against UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg.[citation needed]\n\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Dzagoev was chosen as Best Young Player of the Year by the Russian Football Union.[12]\n\nIn October 2008, it was reported that Real Madrid were interested in signing the player, but it was not confirmed. In the 2008 season Dzagoev played 29 matches and scored 13 goals.[citation needed]\n\nDzagoev scored from a very tight angle during a Champions League match against Manchester United on 4 November 2009, which finished 3\u20133.[13] In 2009 season he played 40 matches and scored 10 goals.[citation needed]\n\nOn 2 December 2010, Dzagoev provided an assist for Sekou Oliseh and later added a cool finish as CSKA defeated Lausanne-Sports 5\u20131 in their penultimate group game, securing first place in Group F of the Europa League.[14] In the final group game against Sparta Prague on 15 December, Dzagoev scored the opening goal as CSKA dropped their first points of their European campaign, succumbing to a 1\u20131 draw.[15]\n\nOn 24 September 2011, Dzagoev scored the winning goal of a 3\u20131 Premier League victory over Volga Nizhny Novgorod.[16] Three days later, Dzagoev scored a 45th-minute goal against Internazionale and a later strike from V\u00e1gner Love put the hosts level, until a late goal from Mauro Z\u00e1rate gave the Italians a 3\u20132 victory.[17]  Dzagoev provided the cross from which CSKA debutant Pontus Wernbloom netted the equalizer in their 1\u20131 draw against Real Madrid in their first leg Round of 16 clash on 21 February 2012.[18] In the 2012\u201313 season CSKA won the Russian Premier League title and Dzagoev was considered by some to be the best left midfielder.[19] In 2013/2014 season CSKA became the champion of Russian Premier League again and Dzagoev played 23 matches and scored 3 goals in all competitions.[citation needed]\n\nThe 2015\u201316 season became one of the best in his career. On 21 May 2016 in the last match of Premier League with Rubin Dzagoev scored the winning goal and CSKA won another Russian Premier League title.[20] In this season he played 43 matches, scores 8 goals and 11 assists in all club competitions.[21]\n\nDzagoev scored twice in the 2016\u201317 UEFA Champions League group stage, against Bayer Leverkusen[22] and Tottenham Hotspur though the Moscow club exited Europe at this stage.[23]\n\nHaving been sidelined with injury for much of 2017\u201318, Dzagoev returned to the CSKA side as a substitute in a Champions League match with FC Basel, scoring the goal at St. Jakob-Park.[24]\n\nOn 21 June 2019, Dzagoev signed a new two-year contract with CSKA Moscow, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2021.[25]\n\nOn 1 July 2021, Dzagoev's contract with CSKA expired. At the end of the same month, the possibility of extending the contract until the end of the 2022\u201323 season was announced.\n\nIn the 2021\u201322 season, Dzagoev appeared in 20 matches and recorded 3 assists, and CSKA itself was not going to win medals again.\n\nIn May 2022, information appeared that, despite the current contract, Dzagoev would leave the club at the end of the season. Dzagoev soon denied these reports.[26]\n\nOn 20 May 2022, CSKA's official website confirmed the midfielder's departure at the end of the season.[27]\n\nOn 2 September 2022, Dzagoev signed a contract until the end of the season with Rubin Kazan, reuniting with his former manager at CSKA, Leonid Slutsky.[28]\n\nAfter a string of impressive performances at club level, Dzagoev was called up to Russia squad for a 2010 World Cup qualification match against Germany scheduled for 11 October 2008.[29] He made his debut as a half-time substitute, at the age of 18 years and 116 days,[30] thus becoming the youngest outfield player ever to compete for Russia, and second youngest overall after goalkeeper and CSKA teammate Igor Akinfeev.[31] Dzagoev nearly earned the team a crucial away draw as he flicked the ball past Germany's goalkeeper Ren\u00e9 Adler, but hit the crossbar.[32]\n\nAfter the game, Russia manager Guus Hiddink stated, \"He's gelled into the team very well... Alan is a really clever player with the ability to make a killer pass and stretch the play. He proved that in Germany once again.\"[33] Dzagoev himself, however, being unhappy with the defeat, labeled his debut \"a flop.\"[33]\n\nHe scored his first international goal on 8 October 2010 in a 2\u20133 away victory over the Republic of Ireland in the qualifying round of UEFA Euro 2012.[34]\nHe was confirmed for the finalized squad for Euro 2012 on 25 May 2012.[35] Dzagoev scored two goals in Russia's opening game of the Euro 2012 tournament against the Czech Republic on 8 June 2012, a 4\u20131 victory,[36][37] in which he was named Man of the Match.[38] Dzagoev added his third goal of the tournament in his side's second game against Poland,[39] earning a 1\u20131 draw for his side.[40] With three goals scored, he finished the tournament as joint-top scorer, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Fernando Torres, Mario G\u00f3mez, Mario Balotelli, and Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107.[citation needed]\n\nOn 2 June 2014, he was included in Russia's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup .[41] Dzagoev appeared as a substitute in all three of the team's matches as Russia were eliminated at the group stage.[citation needed]\n\nDzagoev was included in Russia's squad for UEFA Euro 2016; however he withdrew due to injury on 22 May 2016.[42] He was excluded from the nation's squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup exactly a year later, again with an injury.[43]\n\nOn 11 May 2018, he was included in Russia's extended 2018 FIFA World Cup squad.[44] On 3 June 2018, he was included in the finalized World Cup squad.[45] He featured in the opening match of the tournament against Saudi Arabia but was withdrawn through injury after just 24 minutes.[46] He recovered from injury to come on as a substitute in extra time against Croatia in the quarterfinals. He took a free kick that went brilliantly on to the head of Mari\u00f2 Fernandes that was Russia's 2\u20132 equalizer with 5 minutes left to play in extra time. Dzagoev converted his shot in the eventual penalty shoot-out, but Russia lost to Croatia in the end of it.[47]\n\nDzagoev is a playmaker, who \"enjoys playing behind the strikers\".[31] His main position is on the left side of midfield.[19] However, he is versatile, having also played \"on the right side of Russia's three-man attack\" in their win over the Czech Republic at EURO 2012 in which Dzagoev scored two.[48]\n\nIn 2009, ESPN SoccerNet called Dzagoev \"one of the hottest prospects on the continent\", commenting that he is \"quick, good in the air and with exceptional technical skills\".[31] He has been recognised as the finest in the country in his position, being declared the best left-midfielder in 2013.[19] He was also named as Russia's \"star man\" by BBC Sport when they compiled their UEFA EURO 2012 team profiles.[49] When CSKA manager Leonid Slutsky was asked of Dzagoev following a goal against Tottenham Hotspur in 2016, he opined: \"it's obvious Alan Dzagoev is one of the top players in the Russian league\", adding that it was \"not surprising that scouts were watching him and it will not be surprising if he continues his career in one of the top British clubs\".[23] Shortly before the last round of international friendlies in the run-up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, The Guardian branded Dzagoev as one of \"three Russia players with the capacity to harm top-level opponents\".[50]\n\nInternational goals\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dzagoev"}, {"id": 104, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/108/2156337/original/teddy-sheringham-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Teddy Sheringham", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/teddy-sheringham/2156337", "desc": "Edward Paul Sheringham, MBE (born 2 April 1966) is an English football manager and former player.\nSheringham played as a forward, mostly as a second striker, in a 24-year professional career.

He left to join First Division Nottingham Forest. A year later, Sheringham scored Forest's first ever Premiership goal,[2] and was signed by Tottenham Hotspur. After five seasons at Spurs, Sheringham joined Manchester United where he won three Premiership titles, one FA Cup, one UEFA Champions League, an Intercontinental Cup and an FA Charity Shield. In 2001, he was named both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year. The pinnacle of his career came when he scored the equaliser and provided the assist for Manchester United's winning goal in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final against Bayern Munich, both goals coming in injury time of the second half.\n\nAfter leaving Manchester United at the end of the 2000\u201301 season, Sheringham re-joined Tottenham Hotspur, where he was a losing finalist in the 2001\u201302 Football League Cup. He spent one season at newly promoted Portsmouth, scoring the club's first Premier League goal,[3] before joining West Ham United, where he helped the club gain promotion from the 2004\u201305 Football League Championship. The following season, Sheringham appeared for West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup Final, becoming the third-oldest player to appear in an FA Cup Final.[4]\n\nSheringham is currently the twelfth-highest goalscorer in the history of the Premiership with 146 goals, and is the competition's 32nd-highest appearance maker.[5] He holds the record as the oldest outfield player to appear in a Premier League match (40 years, 272 days)[6] and the oldest player to score in a Premier League match (40 years, 268 days).[7] He was capped 51 times for the England national team, scoring 11 times, and played in the 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 1996 UEFA European Championship. He retired from competitive football at the end of the 2007\u201308 season with Colchester United, at the age of 42. He has since managed League Two club Stevenage, and ATK of the Indian Super League.\n\nSheringham began his professional career at Millwall in 1982 at the age of 16, after impressing a scout when playing for non-league club Leytonstone & Ilford during a youth team game against Millwall. He was signed up, initially as an apprentice and scored on only his second appearance for the club in a match away at Bournemouth in January 1984. After being loaned out by the club twice in 1985 to Aldershot and later a Swedish side, Djurg\u00e5rden, he quickly became a first choice selection at Millwall and during the late 1980s formed a striking partnership with Tony Cascarino. He was the club's top goalscorer in four seasons (1986\u201387, 1987\u201388, 1988\u201389 and 1990\u201391) and played in every game of the season twice, in 1986\u201387 and 1990\u201391.[8]\n\nThe 1987\u201388 season saw the club promoted to the First Division, then the highest tier of English league football, for the first time. Sheringham scored the first goal in Millwall's first home game in Division One. Millwall briefly topped the table at the start of October 1988 and the goals of Sheringham (15) and Cascarino (15) kept Millwall in the top four for most of the season before fading after Easter to finish in 10th position. Sheringham said in his autobiography: \"It was a crazy exhilarating time. There we were, little Millwall, in our first season in the First Division and topping the table until about March. Everybody said it couldn't last and of course it couldn't and it didn't, but we gave them all a good run for their money. We were beating the best teams when we shouldn't and getting away draws to which we had no right.\"[10][11]\n\nMillwall's spell in the top flight was not to last as they were relegated in the following season, finishing bottom of the Division after briefly topping the table again early in the season. Sheringham was again top scorer for Millwall with twelve goals, having missed ten league games through injury.[12] The club had an opportunity to bounce straight back up at the end of the 1990\u201391 season, reaching the semi-finals of the Division Two play-offs, but they were beaten by Brighton & Hove Albion and remained in the Second Division. Sheringham's outstanding form during the 1990\u201391 season saw him finish as the league's highest scorer with 37 goals, a haul which included four hat-tricks. With Millwall failing to return to the top flight, a departure for Sheringham looked inevitable.[13] In his final season at Millwall, Sheringham broke all of the club's goalscoring records, scoring a total of 111 goals in all competitions in his eight years at the club. He was Millwall's all-time leading scorer until 2009.[14]\n\nThe 25-year-old Sheringham was sold to Nottingham Forest in a \u00a32\u00a0million deal in July 1991,[15] to play alongside Nigel Clough. He did well for Forest and helped them finish eighth in the First Division at the end of the 1991\u201392 season, as well as to reach the League Cup final, where they lost to Manchester United. Sheringham scored Forest's first Premiership goal, against Liverpool, in August 1992 (which was also the first ever live goal shown on Sky Sports) but a week later he was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a32.1\u00a0million.[15] Forest went on to be relegated in 1992\u201393, in part due to having failed to adequately replace Sheringham in attack.\n\nSheringham had a successful start to his career at the club by being the Premiership's top goalscorer in its inaugural season, scoring 22 goals (21 with Tottenham and one with Forest).[15] His strike partners at White Hart Lane included Gordon Durie, Ronny Rosenthal, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann and finally Chris Armstrong. In 1993\u201394, he was Tottenham's top scorer with 14 Premiership goals but played in just 19 games due to injury and this impacted negatively on Tottenham's league form. Spurs finished 15th and were not completely safe from relegation until the penultimate game of the season. They have not finished lower than this ever since.[16]\n\nThe following season was better, as he helped Spurs finish seventh in the Premiership and reach the semi-final of the FA Cup, just missing out on European football for the 1995\u201396 season.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, who partnered Sheringham during the 1994\u201395 season, was later quoted as claiming that Sheringham was the most intelligent strike partner he had ever had.[17]\n\nSheringham was hugely popular with the Tottenham fans and by the mid-1990s was firmly established as one of the most highly rated strikers in the Premiership. However, despite his prolific strike rate by the end of the 1996\u201397 season he was 31 years old and had yet to win a major trophy in a career which had so far spanned 15 years; many pundits considered him past his best and likely to finish his career without major honours.\n\nIn June 1997, Sheringham agreed to join Manchester United in a \u00a33.5\u00a0million deal.[18] He was signed to replace the iconic Eric Cantona whose retirement had left the Old Trafford faithful demanding a big name to fill the gap. His first competitive game for the club was against Chelsea in the 1997 FA Charity Shield which United won on penalties. His first league outing was against his former employers, Tottenham, at White Hart Lane. Throughout the game, Sheringham suffered jeers and boos from his former fans, who had been angered by the fact that Sheringham had accused Tottenham of lacking ambition when he made his transfer. In the 60th minute with the score at 0\u20130, Sheringham missed a penalty, although ended up on the winning side as two late goals gave United the win.\n\nSheringham's first season at Old Trafford was difficult \u2013 although he scored 14 goals in all competitions he failed to meet expectations as the 1997\u201398 season ended without the league title. Towards the end of the season, during a game at Bolton Wanderers, an incident occurred that furthered the animosity with fellow striker Andy Cole. When Bolton scored, Sheringham blamed Cole, his strike partner and Cole then refused to talk to him. The breakdown in their relationship was never resolved, and reputedly they never spoke again.[19] This had started three years previously in 1995 when Sheringham had snubbed Cole as the latter came on to make his international debut.[20]\n\nSpeculation that Sheringham would leave United increased just after the 1998\u201399 season got underway, when Dwight Yorke moved to Old Trafford from Aston Villa. Yorke immediately formed a prolific partnership with Cole as United went on to regain the league title on the final day of the season. Sheringham's first-team chances were relatively limited but he still managed to make enough appearances to qualify for a championship medal at the end of the season\u00a0\u2013 at the age of 33 he had won his first major trophy. A week later he came off the substitutes bench to score United's opening goal in a 2\u20130 defeat of Newcastle United in the FA Cup final to secure the double.[21] Four days after the FA Cup triumph, Sheringham scored a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final, having come on as a substitute earlier in the game. With seconds of stoppage-time remaining, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r scored from Sheringham's headed flick-on, and United won a treble of the Premiership, FA Cup and European Cup with Sheringham\u00a0\u2013 having not won a major honour in his 15-year career on leaving Spurs\u00a0\u2013 now having won every top-level trophy in the English game.[22]\n\nSheringham's first-team chances remained limited during 1999\u20132000, but he still played enough times to merit another Premiership title medal. In 2000\u201301, United secured a third consecutive league title, with Sheringham top-scoring for United and playing some of the best football of his career.[23] In April 2001, he was voted Footballer of the Year by both the Professional Footballers' Association and Football Writers' Association.[24][25] His fine form ensured that he was still involved with the national side despite being in his 35th year, being named in the squad for the 2002 World Cup.\n\nAt the end of the 2000\u201301 season, Sheringham's four-year contract at Old Trafford expired. He was facing stiffer competition than ever for the places up front, most of all from United's new Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. He refused United's offer of a 12-month contract[26] and returned to Tottenham on a free transfer as one of new manager Glenn Hoddle's first signings.[27] In his first season back, Sheringham helped Tottenham to a ninth-place finish, the club's highest in 6 years, and to reach the League Cup final where they lost 2\u20131 to Blackburn Rovers, with Sheringham being brought down in the penalty area in the last minute for what he believed to be a penalty.[28] 2002\u201303 brought a similar mid table finish, although Tottenham had topped the Premiership three games into the season. Sheringham made 80 appearances in all competitions for Tottenham in this period, scoring 26 goals.[29]\n\nSheringham and Clive Allen were inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 8 May 2008.[30]\n\nOn the expiry of his Tottenham contract at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, Tottenham decided not to offer Sheringham a new contract[31] and he joined Portsmouth in their first season in the Premier League.[32] Sheringham became the oldest Premiership player to score a hat-trick when he scored three against Bolton early in the season.[33] Despite this, he was only contracted to the club for one season and, despite scoring in his final game (a 5\u20131 win victory over Middlesbrough with the club already secure in the top flight),[34] at the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Portsmouth decided not to offer the 38-year-old striker another contract but he insisted that he wanted to continue his top flight career at another club.[35] Sheringham made 38 appearances for Portsmouth, scoring ten goals.[15]\n\nSheringham then dropped down a division to the Championship to sign for West Ham United,[36] the club he supported as a boy.[37] Sheringham was the division's third-highest scorer in 2004\u201305 with 20 goals (21 in all competitions)\u00a0\u2013 one of the highest goalscoring seasons of his career. He won the Championship Player of the Season award,[38] and helped the Hammers reach the 2005 Football League Championship play-off Final where they beat Preston North End at the Millennium Stadium to return to the Premiership after two seasons in the second tier. At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, Sheringham's one-year contract expired and both he and West Ham agreed to a one-year extension prior to the start of the new season.[39] With his second-half appearance against Charlton Athletic on 2 April 2006, Sheringham became one of just five players to have played top-flight football while in their 40s; joining the likes of Les Sealey, John Burridge, Gordon Strachan and later Ryan Giggs.[40] On 19 August 2006, he became the oldest outfield player in the history of the division, at 40 years 139 days.[41] Sheringham signed a contract to play for West Ham until the end of the 2006\u201307 season,[42] and was a player at the club after his 41st birthday. On 13 May 2006, Sheringham became the third oldest player to appear in an FA Cup final, at 40 years and 41 days old. The game ended 3\u20133, with Liverpool winning the trophy in a penalty shootout. Sheringham was the only West Ham player to convert his kick as Liverpool won the shootout 3\u20131. On 26 December 2006, at the age of 40 years and 266 days, he beat his own record for oldest Premiership scorer, with the goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Portsmouth.[43] On 30 December 2006, he broke the record for oldest Premiership outfield player once more, playing in the 1\u20130 defeat against Manchester City, aged 40 years and 270 days.[44] Sheringham also appeared in 11 FA Cup, League Cup, and UEFA Cup games for West Ham, scoring two goals.\n\nAfter being released by West Ham, Sheringham signed for Colchester United in July 2007 and was given the number 8 shirt.[45] He started Colchester's first game of the season, away at Sheffield United,[46] and scored the first goal in a 2\u20132 home draw against Barnsley a week later.[47] 7 days later he scored again, in a 3\u20130 win at Preston North End.[48] Having just served a three match suspension after being sent off against Coventry, Sheringham was once again amongst the scorers in Colchester's 2\u20131 win at Hillsborough over Sheffield Wednesday.[49] He scored his fourth and final Colchester goal in a 3\u20131 FA Cup defeat to Peterborough United on 5 January 2008.[50] Sheringham made only 3 league appearances in 2008, the last of which came against Stoke City on 26 April 2008, the last game at Layer Road.[51]\n\nWhilst at Colchester, Sheringham was the oldest player in all four divisions of the Football League, and is now part of the elite list of players who have achieved more than 700 League appearances in their career. He retired at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, his career ending on a low note as Colchester were relegated from the Championship\u00a0\u2013 the club's first relegation for 18 years.[52]\n\nSomething of a late developer on the international scene, Sheringham did not win his first England cap until the age of 27 in 1993. Under the reign of manager Terry Venables (1994\u201396) Sheringham came to be the preferred strike partner for Alan Shearer. During this time, England had a wealth of strikers with the likes of Andrew Cole, Ian Wright, a young Robbie Fowler and Les Ferdinand all battling to partner Shearer in the England team.[citation needed]\n\nThe two formed a famous partnership at international level, as they complemented each other's strengths: Shearer the out-and-out goalscorer, big, strong and powerful, Sheringham just 'dropping off' his strike partner, finding spaces, creating play and providing key passes, forming the link between Shearer and the England midfield. The pairing came to be known as 'The SAS' ('Shearer and Sheringham') and their most successful time together came in the 1996 European Championships, held in England. Their most famous contribution was in the 4\u20131 victory over the Netherlands, a game in the opening group stages in which they both scored twice against one of the strongest teams in the tournament. Though England were eventually knocked out in the semi-finals, many believed that that squad of players such as Sheringham and his contemporaries including Paul Gascoigne, Steve McManaman, Tony Adams and Paul Ince, had done the nation proud. At this time, the England squad were also criticised heavily in the media for their part in several off the field incidents during the lead up to the tournament, where Sheringham, McManaman and Gascoigne were photographed drinking heavily and playing \"dentist chair\" drinking games as well as destroying the first class cabin of a Cathay Pacific flight which went down poorly with the public.[citation needed]\n\nSheringham continued to be a first choice selection under new England manager Glenn Hoddle (1996\u201399) until the emergence of new teenage superstar Michael Owen during the course of 1998 saw him overshadowed. Although Sheringham began the 1998 FIFA World Cup as a starting player with Owen on the bench, after Owen replaced him and almost turned around a defeat against Romania in England's second game of the tournament, it seemed likely that Sheringham's front line international career had come to an end.[citation needed]\n\nHe was not selected at all for the 2000 European Championships by then manager Kevin Keegan, but the retirement of Shearer (despite being four years younger than Sheringham) from international football after that tournament and the arrival of new manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson in 2001 saw a return to international favour for him. He was often deployed as a tactical substitute late in games by Eriksson, valued for his ability to hold the ball up and create intelligent play. In 2001, Sheringham scored an important goal for England against Greece in a World Cup qualifying match within 15 seconds of coming on as a substitute, although this event is overshadowed by the 93rd minute equalising free-kick by David Beckham.[citation needed]\n\nHe was selected as part of Eriksson's 2002 FIFA World Cup squad after impressing throughout the 01\u201302 season with his club, and played in the famous 1\u20130 win against Argentina, almost scoring a goal with a volley that was well saved by the Argentine goalkeeper, and made his final England appearance as a substitute in the 2\u20131 quarter-final defeat to Brazil in Japan. His twelve appearances for Eriksson were all as a substitute.[53]\n\nAt the age of 36, that defeat signalled the final end of Sheringham's international career, during which he had earned fifty-one caps and scored eleven times for England.[citation needed]\n\nA versatile forward, Sheringham was capable of playing as a striker and also as a supporting forward, courtesy of his ability both to score and create goals.[54] Due to his vision, his ability to read the game, and his short passing ability, Sheringham was capable of playing off another striker, in a deeper, creative role, where he served as an assist provider, in particular in later years, as he lost pace and stamina.[54][55][56][57] He also possessed good technical ability and upper body strength, which allowed him to retain possession in the box and hold up the ball when playing with his back to goal, and subsequently lay it off to his teammates.[57][58][59] As a centre-forward in his prime, he was also very effective and extremely prolific, due to his accurate finishing, opportunism in the area, intelligence, and his ability in the air, which enabled him to be regarded as one of the top Premier League forwards of his generation.[55][60]\n\nUpon his retirement from professional football in 2008, Sheringham has been a noticeable figure on the world poker scene,[61] playing in various competitions worldwide. He made the final table in the \u20ac5,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event in the EPT Vilamoura, finishing 5th out of a field of 384 players, winning \u20ac93,121.[62]\n\nIn May 2014, Sheringham was appointed as an attacking coach with West Ham United.[63] He was credited with a change in West Ham's style of play which led to a run of good form at the start of the 2014\u201315 season, earning striker Diafra Sakho the Premier League Player of the Month award for October 2014.[64]\n\nOn 21 May 2015, Sheringham was appointed to his first managerial role, taking charge of League Two side Stevenage, replacing Graham Westley.[65] With the club struggling with injuries, he registered himself as a player, aged 49, for a Herts Senior Cup match against Welwyn Garden City in November of that year, but did not play.[66] He was sacked on 1 February 2016, with the club 19th in the league having collected only three points from their previous eight matches.[67]\n\nOn 14 July 2017, Sheringham was named as the new head coach of Indian Super League club ATK.[68] On 24 January 2018, Sheringham was sacked by ATK after winning only three of his ten games in charge of the Kolkata-based outfit.[69]\n\nSheringham's son Charlie, born in 1988, also became a professional footballer. The two made the FA Cup third round draw together in December 2013.[70] Sheringham has two more children with Kristina Andriotis, whom he married in 2016.[71] Earlier in his life, he dated models Danielle Lloyd and Katie Price.[72]\n\nIn 2020, Sheringham competed on the first British series of The Masked Singer, masked as \"Tree\".[73]\n\nDjurg\u00e5rden\n\nMillwall[81]\n\nNottingham Forest\n\nManchester United[82]\n\nWest Ham United\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Sheringham"}, {"id": 105, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/68/1343120/original/kakha-kaladze-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Kakha Kaladze", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/kakha-kaladze/1343120", "desc": "Kakhaber Kaladze (Georgian: \u10d9\u10d0\u10ee\u10d0\u10d1\u10d4\u10e0 (\u10d9\u10d0\u10ee\u10d0) \u10d9\u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10eb\u10d4 [k\u02bcaxab\u025br k\u02bcalad\u0361z\u025b]; born 27 February 1978) is a Georgian politician and retired footballer.

A versatile player, he was capable of playing both as a centre-back and as a left-back,[2] or even as a wide midfielder.[3] He played for the Georgia national team from 1996 to 2011. He was voted Georgian Footballer of the Year in 2001\u20132003, 2006[4] and 2011 and was considered one of Georgia's most important players.[5][6]\n\nKaladze started his football career in 1993 at Umaglesi Liga club Dinamo Tbilisi and made 82 appearances in a five-year spell. In 1998, he moved to the Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv and made 71 appearances until 2001, when he was signed by the Italian Serie A club Milan. He has won one Serie A, three Ukrainian Premier League and five Umaglesi Liga titles. With Milan, he won the Champions League on two occasions, the UEFA Super Cup once and the FIFA Club World Cup once. After captaining his country 50 times in 84 appearances, Kaladze announced his retirement from the Georgian national team on 11 December 2011.[7][8]\n\nBorn in Samtredia, a town in Imereti Province, Kaladze comes from a footballing family as his father played for Lokomotiv Samtredia and was also president of the team for some time. His brother was kidnapped in a high-profile case in 2001 and officially declared dead in 2006, resulting in two men being sentenced to prison for a combined total of 30 years. Outside of football, he owns a company called Kala Capital and an organisation called Kala Foundation, as well as being an ambassador for SOS Children's Villages. He is married to Anouki Areshidze, with whom he has four children.\n\nKaladze became involved in the politics of Georgia as a member of the opposition Georgian Dream\u2013Democratic Georgia party, founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012 and approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister of Energy in Ivanishvili's cabinet on 25 October 2012.[9] He continued to occupy both of these position under the succeeding cabinet of Giorgi Kvirikashvili until July 2017, when he resigned to run for the Mayor of Tbilisi as a Georgian Dream candidate in the October 2017 election,[10] which he won with 51.13%. In 2021, he was reelected as the Mayor of Tbilisi, gaining 55.61% of the vote in the second round of the election.\n\nKaladze started his career playing as a striker for his local club Lokomotiv Samtredia, where his father was president, until former Georgia international footballer David Kipiani requested Kakha to join Dinamo Tbilisi.[11] At Dinamo, he played in 82 domestic league games and scored one goal.[12] He made his top-flight debut as a 16-year-old with Dinamo during the 1993\u201394 campaign.[13][14] Kaladze claims that a good performance against Italy while playing for Georgia in a match that ended 0\u20130 brought him to the attention of Dynamo Kyiv; he later said, \"In that game I was up against Christian Vieri and I marked him well.\"[11]\n\nA fee equivalent to \u20ac280,000 was enough to take him to the Ukrainian Premier League and Dynamo Kyiv in January 1998,[15] where he signed a four-year deal.[16] Here he scored six goals in 71 league games over the two-and-a-half seasons he spent there.[12] The Ukrainian club had been under the ownership of Hryhoriy Surkis and the late Valeriy Lobanovskyi had just been installed as manager; they would go on to win eight consecutive league titles.[17] Kaladze also appeared in both legs of the semi-final of the 1998\u201399 Champions League against Bayern Munich, which Dynamo Kyiv lost 4\u20133 on aggregate.[18][19] En route to the semi-finals, they beat teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Arsenal.[17] He won eight league titles in a row during his time at both Dinamo Tbilisi and Dynamo Kyiv.[20]\n\nIn January 2001, Kaladze became the most expensive Georgian footballer in history when Milan paid \u20ac16 million to bring him to Italy.[21] His decision to join one of the European top teams coincided with witnessing his teammate's near career-ending injury due to poor quality of football pitches in Ukraine at the time.[22][11] Upon his arrival, Kaladze became a regular starter almost immediately, and played mostly as a left-sided defensive midfielder in 4\u20134\u20132 or 4\u20132\u20131\u20133 formations, particularly under caretaker coach Cesare Maldini.[23][14] In the 2002\u201303 season, however, he returned to his original role of a defender (left-sided full back and center back), and made 46 appearances in all competitions, including 27 Serie A appearances.[1][24] That year, Milan won the Champions League, where they beat Juventus on penalties in the final (despite Kaladze missing his penalty)[25] and the Coppa Italia, where they beat Roma 6\u20133 on aggregate in the final.[26] After Kaladze's double success, the Georgian postal service issued a special stamp bearing the player's image.[27] He is the first Georgian player to win a Champions League title.[28]\n\n\"I've always dreamed of playing for a top club abroad, but I could have stayed at Kyiv, picked up an injury and it would all have been over for me. That's why I asked Dynamo president Hryhorii Surkis to put me on the transfer list.\"\n\nKakha Kaladze, upon leaving Dynamo Kyiv in relation to Gerasimenko's injury.[11]\n\nKaladze was limited to just six league appearances and 11 total appearances in the 2003\u201304 season.[1] In the next season, Kaladze played just 19 Serie A matches and five in the Champions League as Milan finished as runners-up in both competitions.[12] He was an unused substitute in that season's Champions League final, where Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after a 3\u20133 draw.[29] He was said to be frustrated with his lack of first-team options and a move to Chelsea, in exchange for Hern\u00e1n Crespo or for \u00a34 million,[30] was widely reported.[31] Kaladze himself said, \"I have agreed everything with the Chelsea management. Now it is necessary to wait for them to reach an agreement with Milan and I think I could become a Chelsea player next week.\"[32] Chelsea opted to sign Asier del Horno instead. On 30 June 2005, Kaladze extended his contract with Milan until 2010[33] and again on 4 September 2006, this time until 2011.[34][35] In 2005\u201306, an injury to Paolo Maldini meant that Kaladze was moved back into the centre of defence, his favoured position.[20] Milan finished third that season, although they would have finished second if there were no 2006 Italian football scandal which resulted in a 30-point deduction.[36]\n\nIn the 2006\u201307 Serie A campaign, Kaladze scored a goal against Sampdoria which turned out to be his only goal of the season. Milan finished in fourth place with an eight-point deduction relating to the previous season's scandal.[37] Kaladze won his second Champions League title on 23 May 2007 after Milan beat Liverpool 2\u20131 in the final; he came on as a 79th-minute substitute in that match.[38] He later picked up the FIFA Club World Cup in December that year where Milan beat Boca Juniors 4\u20132 in the final, though Kaladze was one of two players to be sent off in that match.[39] He had established himself as a first-team regular in the 2007\u201308 season, making 32 appearances,[1] but had only featured sparingly in the 2008\u201309 season due to a knee ligament injury sustained in a UEFA Cup match against Z\u00fcrich.[40][41] Kaladze's performance on 15 February 2009 Milan derby was described as a \"horror show\" on the Channel 4 website which started a dispute over an alleged smear campaign between Kaladze and the Georgian newspaper Lelo, who used the quote, \"Milan really does need a new centre-back after Kakha Kaladze\u2019s horror show in the derby.\"[42][43] Milan finished third in the league that season, ten points behind Serie A champions Inter Milan; Kaladze believed this was caused by the many injuries suffered by the Milan squad.[41]\n\nOn 31 August 2010, Kaladze signed with Genoa;[44] Milan later revealed that it was a free transfer.[45] In the 2010\u201311 season, he played 26 matches and scored one goal, which came against Parma on 30 January 2011.[46] He was named as second-best defender of the 2010\u201311 Serie A by La Gazzetta dello Sport, being surpassed only by his former teammate, Milan's Thiago Silva.[47] On 12 May 2012, Kaladze announced his retirement from football.[48]\n\nKaladze won his first cap against Cyprus in a friendly match on 27 March 1996,[49] coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Mikhail Kavelashvili.[50] Later that year, he was sent off for the first time in his international career against Lebanon in a friendly match.[50] With his team won Malta International Football Tournament 1998.[51] He subsequently featured in his country's qualifying campaigns for the 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups, and the 2000, 2004 and 2008 UEFA European Championships. Georgia, however, have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or the UEFA European Championship since they split from the Soviet Union.[52] His competitive debut was against Poland on 14 June 1997 in a 1998 World Cup qualifier; Georgia lost the match 4\u20131.[50] Just two matches later, Kaladze was sent off for the second time playing for Georgia, along with Georgi Kinkladze, against Moldova in another 1998 World Cup qualifier.[50] Georgia finished in fourth place in the group and failed to qualify.[53] In qualifying for Euro 2000, Georgia finished at the bottom of the group (Group 2) in sixth place, with just one win.[54] Kaladze occasionally captained the side during these qualifiers in the absence of Georgi Nemsadze.[50]\n\nThe qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup ended with Georgia finishing in third place, ahead of Hungary and Lithuania.[55] Kaladze played in all of the matches and often missed the friendlies in between.[50] Kaladze only played in three matches during the Euro 2004 qualifiers, where Georgia finished in last place in the group.[56] He did, however, feature in a 1\u20130 victory over neighbouring Russia, a victory considered to be one of Georgia's greatest successes.[5][50] Kaladze played in all but one of the 2006 World Cup qualifying matches,[50] where Georgia finished sixth in the group, with Kazakhstan being the only team to finish below them.[57] He played fewer matches during the qualification for Euro 2008 and once again Georgia failed to qualify as they finished in sixth place despite starting their campaign with a 6\u20130 win over the Faroe Islands.[50][58]\n\nHe scored his first ever international goal against Latvia on 6 February 2008 in a friendly which Georgia lost 3\u20131.[59] On 5 September 2009, Kaladze scored two own goals in a 2010 World Cup qualifying match against Italy within the space of 11 minutes. The match ended 2\u20130 to Italy.[60] Kaladze was the captain of the national team,[61][62] until 11 December 2011, when he announced his retirement.[63] The La Gazzetta dello Sport reporter and the president of International Sports Press Association, AIPS [Italian], Gianni Merlo said: \"Kakha Kaladze is a man of the history of football in Georgia. In AC Milan he was a pillar of the defense and also a nice and polite man.\"[64]\n\nOn 23 May 2001, Kakha Kaladze's younger brother Levan, a medical student, was kidnapped in Georgia, with a ransom of $600,000 demanded.[65][66][21] Georgia's president at the time, Eduard Shevardnadze, promised that \"everything is being done to locate him\".[67] Despite this assurance, the only time that Levan was ever seen was in a video where he was shown blindfolded and begging for help.[68] Following the kidnapping, Kaladze threatened to take up Ukrainian citizenship,[20] but reverted his decision, stating, \"There was a time when I thought about quitting the national side completely, but I couldn't do it out of respect for the Georgian people and the fans who come and give us such support.\"[69] Roughly four years later, on 6 May 2005, Georgian police officers found eight dead bodies in the Svaneti region and it was speculated that Levan was among the dead.[70][71] On 21 February 2006, Levan was officially identified among the deceased,[21] after tests from FBI experts.[72] The local media claimed that the ransom was paid by Kaladze's family,[72] although another source says that Kaladze's father attempted to meet the kidnappers, who fled as they believed he was followed by the police.[14] Two men were sentenced to prison for the murder: David Asatiani for 25 years and Merab Amisulashvili for five years.[72] On 14 July 2009, Kaladze's wife Anouki gave birth to their first-born son in Milan. The couple named their son Levan, in memory of Kaladze's brother.[73]\n\nKaladze has also been active in charitable causes and is a FIFA ambassador for the SOS Children's Villages.[62] Through his Kala Foundation,[74] a charitable organisation established in 2008, Kaladze raised \u20ac50,000 to benefit South Ossetian refugees during the Russian invasion of Georgia.[14] Kaladze also plans to release an autobiography with the proceeds going to the Kala Foundation.[75]\n\nAlong with his football career, Kaladze is an investor in Georgia, Italy, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.[76] Kaladze owns Kala Capital, an investment company established in 2008 in Georgia with a focus on energy businesses,[77] and whose chief executive is former Georgian Prime Minister Zurab Noghaideli.[78]\n\nKaladze's other businesses include the Buddha Bar in Kyiv that opened in 2008.[79][80] Kaladze is also the owner of a restaurant called Giannino, founded in 1899 by Giannino Bindi, which is based in Milan.[81][82] The restaurant has had a Michelin star under Davide Oldani and the chef in charge was Roberto Molinari.[83][84][85]\n\nKala Capital owned 45 percent of the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company company SakHidroEnergoMsheni, a joint stock company incorporated in Georgia in 1998.[citation needed] His candidacy as Minister of Energy and Natural Resources in October 2012 was therefore overshadowed by concerns about a serious risk that a conflict of interests might arise.[86] Reports on the same day indicated that Kaladze might refuse the energy portfolio or sell off his shares in Georgia Hydropower Construction Company within 10 days of his appointment.[87]\n\nKaladze became involved in the politics of Georgia as a member of the opposition Georgian Dream\u2013Democratic Georgia party founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012 as majoritarian of Samtredia constituency. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister of Energy in the cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili on 25 October 2012.[9] The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles.[88][89] More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a conflict of interest arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent.[90] Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.[91]\n\nIn July 2017, Kaladze resigned as Energy minister in order to run for Tbilisi mayor in the upcoming local elections. On 22 October, he was elected mayor as a candidate of Georgian Dream, winning the elections with 51% of the votes. He was sworn in on 13 November 2017.[92]\n\nHis term expires in 2021. Kaladze has decided to run for a second term as mayor of Tbilisi and to win the elections in 2021. Kaladze started the campaign on July 20.\n\n[1][93]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakha_Kaladze"}, {"id": 106, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/21/404066/original/adrian-mutu-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Adrian Mutu", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/adrian-mutu/404066", "desc": "Adrian Mutu (Romanian pronunciation: [adri\u02c8an \u02c8mutu] (listen); born 8 January 1979) is a Romanian football coach and former player who is currently the reserve team coach at United Arab Emirates club Al Wahda.

During his playing career, he was deployed as a forward or an attacking midfielder.\n\nMutu started his career playing two years for Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti and half a season for Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti, before joining Inter Milan in Italy midway through the 1999\u20132000 Serie A. After only ten games with the Nerazzurri, he left for Hellas Verona and then Parma, for which he scored 39 goals in the next three years. His excellent form brought him a \u20ac22.5 million transfer to Chelsea and a nomination for the Ballon d'Or in 2003.[2][3] Following a failed drug test, he was released and returned to Serie A to join Juventus. After the 2006 Italian football scandal and the relegation of Juventus to Serie B, Mutu decided to join Fiorentina, where he played consistently for the next five years. He then had a season at Cesena and French club Ajaccio, before returning to his native country with Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti in 2014. After two more brief spells with Pune City and ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, Mutu retired from professional football in 2016.\n\nA controversial figure off the field, Mutu received widespread attention following a positive test for cocaine while playing for Chelsea in 2005, which resulted in his immediate release from the club, a subsequent seven-month ban from the Football Association, and Mutu later being ordered to pay \u00a315.2 million in damages to his former employers, the largest financial penalty in FIFA history.[4] He has unsuccessfully tried to appeal the fine numerous times, and was banned for a second time in 2010 following a positive test for sibutramine while at Fiorentina.\n\nFrom his international debut in 2000, Mutu played 77 matches for the Romania national team and scored 35 goals, a joint record alongside Gheorghe Hagi. He was included in the country's squads at the European Championship in 2000 and 2008. A four-time winner of the Romanian Footballer of the Year award, only Gheorghe Popescu and Gheorghe Hagi have received the award more times, with six and seven wins, respectively.\n\nMutu began his professional career with Arge\u0219 Pite\u0219ti and Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti.[5]\n\nIn 2000, Mutu was sold by Inter to Verona in co-ownership deal,[6] for 7,500 million lire (\u20ac3,873,427).[7] The Veneto side also signed Massimo Oddo, Mauro Camoranesi (later a teammate at Juventus), and young rising star Alberto Gilardino (later a teammate at Fiorentina) that season. As Verona faced fellow strugglers Bari on matchday 18 in February 2001, Mutu came off the bench with Verona down a man and trailing 0\u20131 and scored two goals, inspiring Verona to a 3\u20132 victory.[8] The club narrowly avoided relegation through winning the relegation tie-breaker playoffs. In June 2001, Verona bought Mutu outright, for 5,100 million lire. (\u20ac2,633,930)[7][9][10]\n\nOn 12 August 2003, Chelsea paid Parma \u20ac22.5m (around \u00a315.8m) for Mutu's transfer as part of new owner Roman Abramovich's spending spree, on a five-year contract.[11][12][13] He made his debut 11 days later, and scored the winning goal from distance in a 2\u20131 home victory against Leicester City,[14] and with two in a 4\u20132 win at Stamford Bridge against Tottenham Hotspur on 13 September, he totalled four goals in his opening three games.[15]\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, Mutu had a difficult relationship with the club's new manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with each accusing the other of lying about whether the player was injured for a 2006 World Cup qualifying match against the Czech Republic.[16] In September 2004, Mutu was banned from football for 7 months until May 2005 after testing positive for cocaine use.[17]\n\nChelsea started to seek compensation from Mutu in early 2005.[13][18] The Football Association Premier League Appeals Committee decided that the player had committed a breach of his contract without just cause[13] which made Chelsea eligible to claim the compensation.[19] Mutu started his first appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in April 2005 but the case was dismissed in December 2005.[13] On 11 May 2006, Chelsea applied to FIFA for an award of compensation against Mutu. In particular, the club requested that the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) award compensation to the club following Mutu's breaching the employment contract without just cause.[13] However, on 26 October, the DRC decided that it did not have jurisdiction to make a decision in the dispute and that the claim by the club was therefore not admissible.[13] On 22 December, Chelsea lodged a new appeal before the CAS seeking the annulment of the DRC's decision. On 21 May 2007, a CAS panel allowed the club's appeal, set aside the DRC's decision, and referred the matter back to the DRC, \"which does have jurisdiction to determine and impose the appropriate sporting sanction and/or order for compensation, if any, arising out of the dispute\" between the Club and the Player,\"[13]\n\nOn 7 May 2008, the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber ordered Mutu to pay \u20ac17,173,990 in compensation to his former club, Chelsea FC, for breach of contract.[20][21] This included \u20ac16,500,000 for the unamortised portion of the transfer fee paid to Parma, \u20ac307,340 for the unamortised portion of the sign-on fee (received by Mutu), and \u20ac366,650 for the unamortised portion of the fee to the Agent, but was not to take into account the determination of the damages for the amounts already paid by the club to the player (consideration for services rendered) or the remaining value of the employment contract (valued at \u20ac10,858,500). Mutu had to pay within 30 days after being informed of the decision in August 2008.[13] Mutu lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport for the second time,[22] but on 31 July 2009, that court dismissed his appeal,[20] and Mutu was ordered to pay Chelsea the amount plus interest of 5% p.a. starting on 12 September 2008 until the effective date of payment; the matter was submitted to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for its determination. In addition, Mutu had to pay the costs of arbitration for both parties, including CHF 50,000 to Chelsea.[13] The fine was the highest ever levied by FIFA.[23]\n\nMutu could have been banned from football by FIFA if he did not pay the fine[24] although some lawyers disputed this.[25] Mutu started his third appeal, this time to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, in October 2009,[citation needed] but on 14 June 2010 this appeal was also dismissed with Mutu again being ordered to pay Chelsea \u20ac17m in damages.[26][27] In 2013, FIFA DRC decided in a new ruling that Livorno and Juventus were also jointly liable to pay compensation; both clubs immediately appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[28] On 21 January 2015 the Court of Arbitration for Sport annulled the FIFA DRC ruling; Mutu remained the sole party to pay the compensation.[29]\n\nIn 2018, European Court of Human Rights rejected Mutu's appeal against CAS 2015 ruling.[30]\n\nMutu signed a five-year contract with the Italian club Juventus on 12 January 2005, despite still being banned from football until 18 May. As Juventus had no available room to buy another non-EU player from abroad, the move also involved fellow Serie A club Livorno, who signed the player and contemporaneously sold him to Juventus.[31][32]\n\nOn 8 July 2006, Fiorentina announced that they had signed Mutu for \u20ac8 million.[33]\n\nIn July 2008, A.S. Roma made a reported \u20ac18 to 20 million offer to sign him outright,[34][35] but Mutu hinted that he may remain in Florence[36] and eventually signed a new contract reported last to 2012.[37]\n\nOn 29 January 2010, it was reported that Mutu failed a doping test after a Coppa Italia match against Lazio match nine days earlier, in which he scored twice in to help Fiorentina win 3\u20132. The INOC was requested to hand Mutu a one-year ban by the Italian anti-doping prosecutor.[38] He eventually received a nine-month ban on 19 April, which was later reduced to six months and ended on 29 October. After the ban finished, Mutu was suspended by the club due to breach of contract (AWOL) on 7 January 2011.[39] After such events, Mutu publicly apologised to the club and parted company with his agent Victor Becali;[40][41] on 3 February 2011 Fiorentina announced the player was reinstated into the first team with immediate effect.[42]\n\nOn 23 June 2011, it was officially announced that Cesena had signed Mutu on a two-year contract.[43] On 15 January, Mutu scored two goals versus Novara and took his tally to 101 goals in Serie A. After a couple of unconvincing games, on 11 April, Mutu scored a goal against Genoa, to eventually earn a draw for Cesena.[44]\n\nIn the summer of 2012, after Cesena relegated from Serie A, the two parties ended the contract by mutual consent.[45]\n\nAfter his release from Cesena, Mutu signed a new contract with AC Ajaccio of the French Ligue 1 on 28 August 2012. He said that he favoured the Italian culture on Corsica, dismissed claims that he was preparing for retirement, and stated that he would score more goals than Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 of Paris Saint-Germain. Club president Alain Orsoni said that Mutu was the highest-profile player to come to Corsica since Johnny Rep joined SC Bastia in 1978.[46]\n\nAfter his previous season's goal haul was enough to keep Ajaccio in Ligue 1, Mutu's second season saw him play just 9 games and not score, before terminating his contract on 14 January 2014 alongside compatriot \u0218tefan Popescu.[47]\n\nLater that day he was presented at Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti in front of 10,000 fans. He was signed by his former international teammate, Cosmin Contra.[48] In the summer of 2014, Mutu scored both home and away against Viktoria Plze\u0148 in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round, a double which Petrolul impressively won 5\u20132 on aggregate.[49]\n\nOn 26 September 2014, Petrolul announced that the club had ended the contract between the two parties.[50]\n\nOn 30 July 2015, Mutu signed as the marquee player for Indian Super League club FC Pune City.[51]\n\nIn January 2016, Mutu returned to Romania with ASA 2013 T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, having been assured by national manager Anghel Iord\u0103nescu that he could have a place in the UEFA Euro 2016 squad if he played in a better league than India's.[52]\n\nHe played in three of four matches at the UEFA Euro 2000, where Romania reached the quarterfinals for the first time. [53]\n\nMutu scored Romania's only goal of Euro 2008 in the 55th minute of their second match against Italy, however in the same match he had a second-half penalty saved by Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, which could have sent Italy out of the competition and would have guaranteed Romania a spot in the quarter finals. The game finished 1\u20131.[54]\n\nSince 2009, Romania's national team coach R\u0103zvan Lucescu has had reservations about calling him up, because Mutu was revealed to be consuming alcohol after a match with Serbia in World Cup 2010 Qualifications. Because of poor results and fan pressure, R\u0103zvan Lucescu was forced to call him up again.[55] Mutu scored a brace in his first game back, a 3\u20131 win over Luxembourg on 29 March 2011, Romania's first win of the qualifiers.[56] He also scored once in the next game, a 3\u20130 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on 3 June 2011.[57]\n\nOn 11 August 2011, Mutu and his teammate Gabriel Tama\u015f were excluded[58] from the Romania national team after they were found drinking at a bar on the night of 10 August, while their teammates were playing in a friendly match against San Marino.[58] However, after only three games, their suspension was lifted. On 21 November 2013, Mutu was barred from playing on the national team after he posted an image of manager Victor Pi\u0163urc\u0103 as Mr. Bean on Facebook.[59]\n\nA highly skilful and creative player, with an eye for goal, who was, however, troubled by off-field issues throughout his career, Mutu was capable of playing in several offensive positions, and was used as a supporting forward, as a main striker, as a winger, and also as an attacking midfielder, due to his ability to both score and assist goals. Often compared to compatriot Gheorghe Hagi, in his prime, Mutu was a quick and mobile player, with excellent technical skills and dribbling ability, and was also an accurate set-piece and penalty-kick taker. Despite his talent, he was often prone to injury and accused of inconsistency throughout his career, and was also notorious for his temperamental character and behaviour on the pitch; because of this, he was often regarded as not having lived up to his true potential.[60][61][62]\n\nMutu began his managerial career in April 2018 when he was appointed as manager of Romanian Liga I club Voluntari, signing a two-year contract following the departure of former manager Claudiu Niculescu.[63] However, his tenure lasted just two months. Although he managed to save the club from relegation, winning a play-off against Chindia T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, the club's board of directors chose to fire Mutu on 14 June. Club president Dan Leasa disagreed with the board's decision and also left the club.[64]\n\nIn July 2018, Mutu was signed by United Arab Emirates club Al Wahda to be the manager of their reserve team.[65]\n\nMutu was in a relationship with Israeli model and actress Moran Atias during the early 2000s.[66]\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, he was married to the Romanian actress and television presenter Alexandra Dinu with whom he has a son, Mario (2002).[67]\n\nIn 2005, he married Consuelo Matos G\u00f3mez, a Dominican model, at the Romanian Orthodox Scala Celli church in Rome.[68] They have two daughters, Adriana (2006) and Maya Vega (2008). They got divorced in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, he married Sandra Bachici, a former model.[69]They have a son, Tiago Adrian Mutu (2017).\n\nDinamo Bucure\u0219ti\n\nJuventus\n\nIndividual\n\nRecords\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mutu"}, {"id": 107, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/114/2260574/original/tony-adams-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Tony Adams", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/tony-adams/2260574", "desc": "Tony Alexander Adams  (born 10 October 1966) is an English football manager.

Adams played for Arsenal and England, captaining both teams. He spent his entire playing career of 19 years as a centre back at Arsenal, making 672 total appearances.[2] He is considered one of the greatest Arsenal players of all time by the club's own fans and was included in the Football League 100 Legends.[3]\n\nWith Arsenal, he won four top flight division titles, uniquely captaining a title-winning team in three different decades,  three FA Cups, two Football League Cups, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and two FA Community Shields.[4] A statue honouring Adams was unveiled at Emirates stadium on 9 December 2011, along with statues of Thierry Henry and Herbert Chapman. He won 66 caps for England between 1987 and 2000 and played at four major tournaments.\n\nWhen his playing career finished Adams went into football management, spending periods in charge of Wycombe Wanderers, Portsmouth, Azerbaijani side Gabala and Spanish side Granada.\n\nBorn in Romford, Adams grew up in Dagenham and was a pupil at Hunters Hall Primary School from 1971 to 1978 and then Eastbrook Comprehensive School from 1978 to 1983.[5] His cousin is fellow professional footballer Steve MacKenzie.[6]\n\nAdams signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980. He made his first-team debut on 5 November 1983 against Sunderland in the First Division, four weeks after his 17th birthday. Adams became a regular player in the 1986\u201387 season, winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the Football League Cup Final win over Liverpool at Wembley.[7]\n\nTogether with Lee Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Steve Bould, Adams was part of the \"famous back four\" that lined up in Arsenal's defence, which under George Graham was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the offside trap.[8] On 1 January 1988, he became Arsenal captain at the age of 21;[9] he would remain club captain for the next 14 years until his retirement.\n\nAdams's strong discipline of the defence was considered a factor in Arsenal winning the League Cup in 1986\u201387 and then the First Division championship twice; the first in 1988\u201389 after a win over Liverpool in the final game of the season; the second in 1990\u201391, losing once all season.\n\nIn 1992\u201393 Adams gained the distinction of being the captain of the first English side to win the League Cup and FA Cup double, lifting the European Cup Winners' Cup the following year.[10]\n\nDespite this success, a battle with alcoholism, which started in the mid-1980s, increasingly blighted his life as he was reportedly often involved in fights in nightclubs. On 6 May 1990, Adams crashed his Ford Sierra into a wall in Rayleigh and when breathalysed his blood alcohol level was found to be more than four times the legal drink-drive limit. On 19 December that year, at Southend Crown Court,[9][11][12] he was sentenced to four months in prison, and freed after half of his sentence on 15 February 1991.[13]\nHe became one of the most high-profile recovering alcoholics in the UK;[14] his battle with alcohol is detailed in his autobiography, Addicted, which was released in May 1998 to enormous critical acclaim.[14]\n\nSix weeks into Adams's sobriety, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger arrived as Arsenal manager in October 1996. Adams reflected in 2020 that Wenger understood his psychology, and knew of the dangers of alcohol as his parents ran a pub.[15] Adams rewarded his manager's understanding handsomely, captaining the club to two Premiership and FA Cup Doubles, in 1997\u201398 and 2001\u201302.[7]\n\nIn August 2002, just before the start of the 2002\u201303 season, Adams retired from professional football after a career spanning almost 20 years, his last match being the 2002 FA Cup Final.[16] He played 674 matches for Arsenal (only David O'Leary has played more) and was the most successful captain in the club's history. The number 6 shirt that Adams wore when playing was not used again until the 2006\u201307 season, when it was assigned to Philippe Senderos.[17]\n\nJust before his retirement as a player, Adams had applied to become manager of Brentford (who had just missed out on promotion to Division One) after the resignation of Steve Coppell, but his application was rejected.[18]\n\nNicknamed \"Mr Arsenal\", he was honoured by Arsenal with a testimonial game against Celtic in May 2002 with many Arsenal legends playing, including Ian Wright, John Lukic and Adams's fellow back four stalwarts, Dixon, Winterburn and Bould. The game finished 1\u20131 with Lee Dixon, in his final appearance for the Gunners, getting their goal.[2] In March 2003, just seven months after his retirement and with Arsenal BBC Sport named Adams as the former Arsenal player that the club would most benefit from returning.[19]\n\nIn 2004, Adams was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his impact on the English game, and in 2008 he was placed third in the 50 Greatest Gunners poll on the club's website.\n\nA statue of Adams was placed outside Emirates Stadium in celebration of the club's 125th anniversary on 9 December 2011. Manager Herbert Chapman and Arsenal's all-time top goal scorer Thierry Henry[20] and later Dennis Bergkamp were also immortalised with statues outside the ground.[21]\n\nAdams made his debut for England against Spain in 1987,[7] and played in UEFA Euro 1988. England lost all three games, but Adams scored one of England's two goals in the tournament in a 3\u20131 defeat to the Soviet Union. He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.\n\nAfter a highly promising start to his international career, Adams suffered a series of setbacks during the early 1990s. He was surprisingly left out of the 1990 FIFA World Cup squad by manager Bobby Robson,[7] missed UEFA Euro 1992 due to injury, whilst England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. England reached the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 1996, before losing on penalties to Germany.\n\nAdams appeared at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Later that year, he made headlines for several statements in his autobiography Addicted, criticising manager Glenn Hoddle for his management of David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne, and for making Alan Shearer captain instead of Adams; he also called Gascoigne an alcoholic, which was denied by the player's representatives. Hoddle told the press that he had no problems with Adams's opinions from the book.[22]\n\nHis international swansong was England's unsuccessful UEFA Euro 2000 campaign. With Shearer retiring from international football after the tournament, Adams regained the captaincy. However, within months, England lost a World Cup qualifier to Germany in October 2000, the match being the last to be staged at Wembley Stadium, before the stadium was torn down for rebuilding. That match was Adams's 60th Wembley appearance, a record. With Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson eventually taking the helm and under increasing pressure for his place from the emerging and improving Rio Ferdinand, Adams retired from international football, having made 66 appearances,[23] before Eriksson picked his first squad. He was the last England player to score at the old Wembley Stadium when he scored England's second goal in a 2\u20130 friendly win over Ukraine on 31 May 2000. This was also his first goal since he scored in a friendly against Saudi Arabia in November 1988, thus making the record for the longest gap between goals for England.\n\nAdams was the first, and remains to date the only, England player to make tournament appearances in three separate decades.\n\nDescribed as a \"stopper\" (or man\u2013marking defender) by Tom Sheen of The Guardian in 2014, Adams played as a centre-back. A tall, brave, rugged, physical, and committed defender, his main traits were his leadership, aerial prowess, and his ability to read the game and time his tackles. While initially he was not known to be the most gifted player on the ball from a technical standpoint, he developed this aspect of his game under Wenger, and he later excelled as a ball-playing centre-back, in which he became known for his ability to carry the ball out from the back, as well as his penchant for undertaking individual runs.[2][24][25][26][27][28][29][30] However, he was also known for his lack of pace.[31][32]\n\nAfter starting a sports science degree at Brunel University, Adams became the manager of Wycombe Wanderers on 5 November 2003. He took over the team that were in last place in the Football League Second Division (third tier).[33] On his debut three days later, he won 4\u20131 at home to Swindon Town in the first round of the FA Cup.[34] After a 2\u20131 loss at Tranmere Rovers on 12 April 2004 left the Chairboys 12 points inside the relegation zone with four games remaining, Adams said that his team would carry on fighting; unbeknown to the club, they were already relegated as two teams above them still had to play each other.[35]\n\nWycombe began 2004\u201305 in the fourth tier, renamed League Two. Although the club were top of the table in August 2004, a loss of form saw them fall down the table. Adams resigned from Wycombe on 9 November 2004, with the club in 17th, citing personal reasons.[36]\n\nIn July 2005, Adams accepted a trainee coaching role with Dutch side Feyenoord with special responsibility for its Jong team, which is a reserve/junior side. Adams later had a short spell seconded to Utrecht as a first team trainee coach in January and February 2006. While at Feyenoord he also worked part-time as a scout for Arsenal, watching games in Italy, France and the Netherlands.[37]\n\nAdams joined Portsmouth as assistant manager to Harry Redknapp in June 2006, a position left vacant by the departure of Kevin Bond. In his first season as assistant, Portsmouth finished ninth in the Premier League \u2013 their highest standing since the 1950s and won the 2007\u201308 FA Cup. Adams was appointed caretaker manager of Portsmouth in October 2008, alongside Joe Jordan,[38] following the departure of Harry Redknapp to Tottenham Hotspur. He was subsequently appointed full-time manager.[38][39] He was sacked in February 2009 after just 16 games in charge in which Portsmouth picked up only 10 points.[40]\n\nIn May 2010, Adams signed a three-year contract to manage Azerbaijani club Gabala FC of the Azerbaijan Premier League.[41] He departed as coach of Gabala due on 16 November 2011, before the end of the 2011\u201312 season.[42]\n\nIn October 2012, Adams returned to Gabala in the capacity of Sporting Director.[43]\n\nOn 10 April 2017, Adams was named as manager of La Liga strugglers Granada CF until the end of the 2016\u201317 season.[44][45] At the end of the season, Granada were relegated from La Liga ending their six-year stay in the top division. Adams lost all seven games as manager and was subsequently sacked.[46]\n\nIn September 2000, as a result of his own experiences with alcoholism and drug addiction, Adams founded the Sporting Chance Clinic, a charitable foundation aimed at providing treatment, counselling and support for sports men and women suffering from drink, drug or gambling addictions.[56] The clinic, which works to the twelve-step programme philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous is based near Liphook in Hampshire and includes Kate Hoey, Alex Rae and Elton John as patrons, and is supported by the Professional Footballers' Association. Adams's former Arsenal and England teammate Paul Merson, himself a recovering alcoholic, is also a patron of the charity.\n\nHis Arsenal testimonial match helped raise \u00a3500,000 for his charity, the Sporting Chance Clinic.[2]\n\nAdams is a Patron for NACOA\u2014a charity that provides information, advice and support for anyone affected by their parents' drinking.[57] He is also a Patron for charity School-Home Support (SHS). SHS helps disadvantaged children and young people overcome barriers to education such as poverty, domestic abuse and housing issues.[58]\n\nAdams remains a popular figure with Arsenal fans. In December 2008, more than six years after he left the club, Adams led out his Portsmouth side onto the pitch at Arsenal to be greeted with the chant \"There's only one Tony Adams\" by Arsenal fans.[59]\n\nOn 30 December 2009, Adams was the guest editor on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nIn 2015, Adams underwent heart surgery after suffering from chest pains. After the operation, he stated that it had probably saved his life.[60]\n\nIn December 2018, Adams was named as the 29th President of the Rugby Football League from summer 2019, replacing politician Andy Burnham;[61][62] he was succeeded in the honorary role by broadcaster Clare Balding a year later.[63]\n\nIn 2022, he took part as a celebrity contestant in the twentieth series of Strictly Come Dancing being partnered by dance professional Katya Jones.\n\nArsenal\n\nIndividual\n\nOrders\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Adams"}, {"id": 108, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/97/1920515/original/robert-jonquet-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Robert Jonquet", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/robert-jonquet/1920515", "desc": "Robert Jonquet (3 May 1925 \u2013 18 December 2008) was a French former football defender.

He played the majority of his professional career for the club Reims, winning five French championships and appearing in two European Cup finals. He is considered one of the best central defenders of his time.[1]\n\nNicknamed \"The Hero of Highbury\" after an outstanding individual performance against England in London in 1951, Jonquet was integral to the France national football team of the 1950s, playing at the World Cup finals of 1954 and 1958.\n\nRobert Henri Jonquet was born on 3 May 1925 in the 14th arrondissement of Paris.[2]\n\nDuring his youth, Jonquet played in the surrounding countryside of southern Paris in Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, and afterwards for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sportive Voltaire. In 1946/47, he played his first season at Reims in the division 1. He became a first-team player, and in the spring 1947, he was called up for the first time to the France national football team. Jonquet was relatively short (1.76 m) for his playing position, but as a libero, played with elegance and talent in the number 5 shirt, rather than in the mould of a typical centre-back \"destroyer\".\n\nIn the 1948/49 season he won his first French championship, 1950 the Coupe de France, followed in 1953 by his second French championship and the Latin Cup. In the year after he participated with Les Bleus in its first World Cup finals in Switzerland; in 1955 he won the French championship again, the French Supercup, was finalist in the Latin Cup and the following year (1956) reached with Reims the final of the newly born European Cup, losing to Real Madrid 3:4. Two further high points of these years took place on international fields: in October 1951 with the France he played in London against England (which included Alf Ramsey and Billy Wright). Jonquet's superb game helped France obtain a 2:2 draw, and on the next morning a newspaper headline referred to him as \"The Hero of Highbury\".[3] The \"hero\" also played in a European selection which defeated England in a friendly match in 1955.\n\nRobert Jonquet's fellow players with Reims reads like a Who's Who of French football during the 1950s: between goalkeeper (Dominique Colonna) and offensive forces (Raymond Kopa, Michel Hidalgo, L\u00e9on Glovacki, Jean Vincent, Just Fontaine, Roger Piantoni, Ren\u00e9 Bliard) stood safe defensive players such as Roger Marche, Armand Penverne, Albert Batteux, Michel Leblond, Jean Wendling \u2013 and evenly over one decade for Jonquet, who is the only players who played in two finals of the European Cup as well as two finals of the Latin Cup. Albert Batteux by the way accompanied and supported Jonquet career over this time in three different ways: as a fellow players (until 1950), as a manager (1950\u20131959) and as France national football team coach (starting from 1955).\n\nThe 1957/58 season held further titles but also included probably the blackest hour for Jonquet. With Reims he won the treble of the French Championships Cup and Super Cup. In addition he participated in its second soccer world championship, at 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden where France finished third. However its misfortune in the semi-final (see below) prevented Jonquet's participation in the match for third place (6: 3 against Germany).[4]\n\nAfter the second European Cup final against rival Real Madrid (1959, 0:2) Raymond Kopa returned from Los Merengues to Reims \u2013 and Jonquet won his fifth French championship in 1960 and his third Super Cup. In this summer he retired at age 35 from France and moved to Racing Strasbourg in the second division, helping them to promote to the top division division 1 in 1961 \u2013 his final success as a player.\n\nBetween April 1948 and July 1960 Robert Jonquet played 58 matches for France and captained them. He participated 1954 FIFA World Cup (one match) and 1958 FIFA World Cup (five matches as the team captain). In Sweden his injury in the semi-final against Brazil after 35 minutes, following an impact with Vav\u00e1, all but incapacitated him. In the half-time break \u2013 substitutes at that time not yet permitted \u2013 the team physician injected a pain-satisfying syringe, and Jonquet was able to stand on two legs. He spent the second half more or less useless and hobbling on the left wing. Indeed, he had broken its fibula.[5][6] But five months later he came back in the national team.[7]\n\nHe played his last match at Euro 1960 against Czechoslovakia.[8]\n\nAt RC Strasbourg, Jonquet moved from the playing field to the coaching sidelines, enjoying a spell with Reims and afterwards with a small teams, Romilly-sur-Seine, \u00c9pernay and Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne.[9] He was very disappointed with the rise of money in football, missing his time at Stade de Reims.[10] He died on 17 December 2008 in Reims, Marne.[2] His club Reims gave his name to a stand of their stadium Auguste Delaune.[11]\n\nReims\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jonquet"}, {"id": 109, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/449/8967815/original/harry-mcshane-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Harry McShane", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/harry-mcshane/8967815", "desc": "Harold McShane (8 April 1920 \u2013 12 November 2012) was a Scottish football player, who played as a direct and speedy winger.

He worked at Old Trafford after his retirement, spending a period as the stadium's announcer.\n\nBorn in Holytown, North Lanarkshire, McShane started his football career as an amateur with Bellshill Athletic, before turning professional at Blackburn Rovers in April 1937.[5] During the Second World War, he guested for Manchester City, Blackpool, Reading and Port Vale.[1]\n\nAfter the war ended he joined Huddersfield Town, and made 15 appearances in the First Division in the 1946\u201347 season, scoring one goal in a 5\u20132 win over Derby County at Leeds Road on 11 September.[5] After recovering from a broken arm, he moved on to league rivals Bolton Wanderers in 1947.[5]\n\nWalter Rowley's \"Trotters\" finished in 17th place in 1947\u201348, 14th place in 1948\u201349, and 16th place in 1949\u201350. He scored six goals in 93 league games during his spell at Burnden Park. McShane joined Manchester United in exchange for defender John Ball and \u00a35,000 in September 1950.

He was part of the United side that won the First Division title in 1951\u201352, scoring one goal in 12 league games that season.[4] His goal was an important one, as it came against rivals Manchester City in a 2\u20131 win at Maine Road on 15 September. He then struggled with a cartilage injury,[4] and appeared just five times in the 1952\u201353 campaign, as Matt Busby's side dropped to eighth place.[2]\n\nMcShane failed to break into the first team in the 1953\u201354 season, and in February 1954 was transferred to George Hardwick's Oldham Athletic for \u00a3750.[4] The \"Latics\" were relegated out of the Second Division at the end of the 1953\u201354 season, and then finished tenth in the Third Division North in 1954\u201355.

In 2014, he surpassed the record held by Vladimir Beschastnykh for most goals for the Russian national team.\n\nBorn in Kingisepp, Leningrad Oblast, he spent the 2000 season at amateur club FC Svetogorets Svetogorsk, helping them win the Northwest regional league by scoring 18 goals.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2001 Kerzhakov transferred to FC Zenit Saint Petersburg, debuting in March and scoring his first goal in June against Spartak Moscow. In his first season, Kerzhakov was the second choice striker behind Hennadiy Popovych. However, later in 2001, he helped Zenit finish third in the Russian Premier League and runners-up in 2003. In 2002, Kerzhakov developed a striking partnership with Andrei Arshavin which earned them both call-ups to the Russian national team. That year Kerzhakov represented Russia at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2003, Czech manager Vlastimil Petr\u017eela used Kerzhakov as a first choice striker and he became the top scorer of the Russian Premier League the following season. While under Petr\u017eela, Kerzhakov started in all four group games of the 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup and went on to score a hat trick in a 5\u20131 victory over AEK Athens. The following season, he was in the starting line up once again in Zenit's second straight UEFA Cup campaign. Zenit qualified for the round of 32 by overcoming Vit\u00f3ria, Be\u015fikta\u015f, Bolton, and Sevilla. In the knockout stages, Kerzhakov scored against Rosenborg and Olympique de Marseille as Zenit reached the quarterfinals to face Sevilla.[2] Kerzhakov gave his best performance by scoring a goal in the away leg but could not save his team as they lost out 5\u20132 on aggregate.[citation needed]\n\nWith decreased playing timed following the appointment of Dick Advocaat at Zenit, Kerzhakov transferred to Sevilla in December 2006, signing a five-and-a-half-year contract worth \u20ac5\u00a0million, as part of the deal of the partnership of the clubs.[3]\n\nUnder then manager Juande Ramos, Kerzhakov featured alongside Lu\u00eds Fabiano and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9.[4] He played his first match on 14 January 2007 and scored his first goal on 28 January 2007 in a 4\u20132 victory against Levante UD. He scored the winning goal against Tottenham in a 4\u20133 victory in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals on 5 April 2007. Kerzhakov later contributed to Sevilla's victorious run in the 2006\u201307 UEFA Cup season.[5]\n\nAfter Juande Ramos moved to Tottenham Hotspur in October 2007, Kerzhakov's playing time decreased under caretaker manager Manuel Jim\u00e9nez. Being selected behind Lu\u00eds Fabiano, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, Javier Chevant\u00f3n, and Arouna Kon\u00e9, it was speculated that Kerzhakov would quit Sevilla following interest from Tottenham, Manchester United, and Paris Saint-Germain.[6]\nAccording to Russian newspaper Sport-Express, on 30 January 2008, Kerzhakov stated he would stay at Sevilla to help in the La Liga and UEFA Champions League campaigns.[7]\n\nIn February 2008, after being left out of Sevilla's Champions League tie against Fenerbah\u00e7e, Kerzhakov signed a three-year contract with Russian side Dinamo Moscow.[8] Kerzhakov established himself as a first choice striker with Tsvetan Genkov and C\u00edcero, scoring his first goal against FC Moscow. He finished the 2008 season as the top scorer in the squad with seven goals, helping the club finish in third place and earn a play off spot in the qualifiers for the UEFA Champions League.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the 2009 season, Kerzhakov maintained his spot as a first choice striker ahead of Aleksandr Kokorin and Fedor Smolov but Dynamo finished eighth and lost to Celtic and CSKA Sophia in an attempt to qualify for the Champions League and inaugural Europa League.[citation needed]\n\nIn January 2010, Kerzhakov rescinded the last year of his contract with Dynamo and returned to his first professional club Zenit St. Petersburg. Under incoming manager Luciano Spalletti, Kerzhakov became the first choice striker in a 4-2-3-1 formation and managed twenty six appearances.[9] He scored his first goal against CSKA Moscow in April 2010 and followed up with two hat tricks against R.S.C. Anderlecht in the UEFA Europa League and Saturn Moscow in the domestic league.[10][11]\n\nThe following season began with a disappointing loss to FC Twente in the round of 16 of the Europa League. However, Kerzhakov went on to score 23 goals in 32 appearances in the Russian Premier League, finishing as the second highest goal scorer behind CSKA Moscow's Seydou Doumbia. Zenit finished first in the regular season and then won the championship group in the spring of 2012 to claim their second league title in two years.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, Kerzhakov was a first choice striker in Spalletti's 4-2-3-1 formation, netting 11 goals in the league, including braces against Amkar Perm, Mordovia Saransk, and Spartak Vladikavkaz. He participated in the UEFA Champions League, scoring his only goal outside the Russian Premier League against Anderlecht. After Zenit failed to make the knockout stage, Kerzhakov played in the UEFA Europa League but failed to score as his club lost to F.C. Basel in the round of 16. With Spalletti purchasing Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n midway through the 2013\u201314 season, Kerzhakov's playing time decreased amid reports of a strained relationship with the Italian manager.[12]\n\nAfter the arrival of Andre Villas-Boas in March 2014, Kerzhakov in five of the last nine matches of the season as Zenit finished in second place behind CSKA Moscow. The following season, Zenit won the league with Kerzhakov playing in 14 matches and scoring three goals. He also played in the club's Champions League campaign, coming on as a substitute in three of the group stage matches. Kerzhakov started the 2014\u201315 season with a brace in an 8\u20131 victory over Torpedo Moscow as Zenit won the first eight matches in the league.[13] Villas-Boas used Kerzhakov as a substitute with speculations of a rift between the two.[14] Villas Boas excluded Kerzhakov from the squad during the 2015\u201316 season, with the striker making no appearances in the league or European tournaments before being loaned out to FC Zurich.[15]\n\nAt Zurich, Sami Hyypi\u00e4 used Kerzhakov as a striker in a 4-2-3-1 formation. He would go on to score five goals in seventeen appearances in a campaign that ended in the club's relegation from the Swiss Super League.[16]\n\nKerzhakov returned to Zenit for the 2016\u201317 season under Mircea Lucescu.[17] Lucescu used Kerzhakov as a substitute striker, only starting him in the first match of the season. Kerzhakov officially retired on 13 July 2017 and was appointed the coordinator of Zenit's youth and academy teams.[18]\n\nKerzhakov began playing for the Russian U21 team in 2001. He made his senior debut for Russia in a friendly against Estonia on 27 March 2002. Two months later, Oleg Romantsev selected Kerzhakov for the 2002 FIFA World Cup as one of four strikers alongside Vladimir Beschastnykh, Ruslan Pimenov, and Dmitri Sychev. He was on the bench for Russia's first two games against Tunisia and Japan but came on for Valery Karpin against Belgium in the 82nd minute and provided an assist for Sychev in an eventual 3\u20132 defeat.[19][20]\n\nAfter Romanstev's sacking, new manager Valery Gazzaev made Kerzhakov a regular call up in the squad. Just prior to the start of the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifiers, Kerzhakov scored his first goal for Russia in a friendly 1\u20131 draw against Sweden on 21 August 2002. In 2003, he won the Cyprus International Football Tournament, playing in the final match.[21]\n\nAfter making eight appearances in the qualification tournament, he was selected by Georgi Yartsev for the final tournament as one of four strikers in the squad behind with Dmitri Bulykin, Dmitri Kirichenko, and Dmitri Sychev. He was on the bench for the games against Spain and Greece, but played a full game against Portugal, as Russia was eliminated from the group stage.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing Euro 2004, Kerzhakov featured regularly under Yartsev during the 2006 World Cup qualifiers and scored a goal against Liechtenstein in March 2005.[22][23] Yartsev's successor Yuri Semin, continued to select Kerzhakov as he went on to score three goals including a double against Liechtenstein as Russia failed to qualify for final tournament.[24]\n\nUnder Guus Hiddink, Kerzhakov continued his role as the first choice striker but was dropped after limited appearances for Zenit in late 2006.[25] Upon moving to Sevilla, Hiddink overlooked Kerzhakov for a friendly against the Netherlands in February 2007.[26] Being recalled for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia and scored both goals in a 2\u20130 victory.[27] In June 2007, Kerzhakov scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 victory over Andorra.[28] He made a further contribution to Russia's Euro 2008 qualification campaign by scoring a goal in a 3\u20130 victory over Macedonia in September 2007.[29] Despite being the top scorer for Russia with five goals, Kerzhakov failed to make Hiddink's 23-man squad for the tournament finals.[30]\n\nAfter an 18-month exclusion, Kerzhakov was recalled in May 2009 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifier against Finland in Helsinki.[31] He started the game and scored two goals as Russia defeated Finland 3\u20130 and went on to play for the remainder of the campaign.[32] During the playoff against Slovenia, Kerzhakov was on the bench for first leg but came on at half-time for Roman Pavlyuchenko in the second leg. In the 66th minute, he received a straight red card from Terje Hauge for a deliberate kick at Slovenian goalkeeper Samir Handanovi\u0107. Slovenia emerged victorious with a 1\u20130 win and eliminated Russia after an aggregate 2\u20132 draw on away goals.[33]\n\nKerzhakov's red card against Slovenia resulted in a suspension for two qualifiers of the Euro 2012 campaign.[34] Upon being recalled by Dick Advocaat, Kerzhakov scored in the victories over Ireland and Macedonia.[35][36] He did not score again for the rest of the qualification campaign but managed to make three additional appearances as Russia topped Group B to qualify directly for the final tournament. Advocaat included him in the final tournament squad, but he scored no goals as Russia failed to progress from their group.[37]\n\nAfter Euro 2012, former England manager Fabio Capello utilized Kerzhakov as the first choice striker after dropping Andrei Arshavin, Roman Pavlyuchenko, and Pavel Pogrebnyak. Kerzhakov appeared in all ten of Russia's qualification matches and finished as the team's top goalscorer with five goals, including the winning goal in a 1\u20130 defeat of Portugal.[38]\n\nMaking Capello's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Kerzhakov appeared as a 71st-minute substitute for Yuri Zhirkov and scored the team's equalising goal three minutes later in the opening match of the tournament, a 1\u20131 draw with South Korea. The goal was his 26th for Russia, equaling Vladimir Beschastnykh's record for the national team.[39] Kerzhakov came on as a late substitute for Aleksandr Samedov in Russia's 0\u20131 defeat to Belgium.[40] He started in the final group match against Algeria before being substituted for Maksim Kanunnikov in a 1\u20131 draw as Russia were eliminated in the first round.[41]\n\nOn 3 September 2014, he became the top scorer for the Russian national team after netting two goals in a 4\u20130 friendly win over Azerbaijan.[42]\n\nKerzhakov continued to appear in Capello's squads for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualification campaign. He was on the bench against Sweden and Austria while being substituted at half-time against Liechtenstein and Moldova.[43][44] Kerzhakov went on to appear as a second-half substitute in the 0\u20131 home defeat to Austria in what was Capello's last match at Russia coach.[45] Capello's successor, Leonid Slutsky, omitted Kerzhakov from the remaining qualification matches as well as the final tournament.[46] He made his final appearance for the national team in a friendly against Lithuania on 26 March 2016.[47]\n\nOn 15 March 2018, the Russian Football Union announced signing a contract with Kerzhakov to manage the Russia national under-17 football team until the end of 2019.[48] The team became Russia national under-18 football team in September 2018 as the players aged and then Russia national under-19 football team.[citation needed]\n\nOn 24 September 2020, he was hired as manager by the FNL club FC Tom Tomsk.[49] He left Tom at the end of the 2020\u201321 season.[50]\n\nOn 17 June 2021, he signed with FC Nizhny Novgorod, which was recently promoted into the Russian Premier League.[51] The club avoided relegation at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, and on 16 June 2022 Kerzhakov left Nizhny Novgorod.[52]\n\nOn 8 February 2023, Kerzhakov was hired as a manager by Cypriot club Karmiotissa Polemidion.[53]\n\nHis younger brother, Mikhail, is a professional footballer who also plays for Zenit Saint Petersburg as a goalkeeper.[citation needed] In 2002, Kerzhakov authored his autobiography titled Up to 16 and older. (Russian: \u0414\u043e 16 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0435)[citation needed]\n\nAs of 21 May 2022\n\nZenit Saint Petersburg\n\nSevilla\n\nFC Z\u00fcrich\n\nIn 2017 became an ambassador of social Football for Friendship international children's forum.[57] In 2018 took part in the Football for Friendship programme where he presented the cup to the winners of the final match of the programme's championship.[58]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Kerzhakov"}, {"id": 111, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/45/899122/original/dwight-yorke-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Dwight Yorke", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/dwight-yorke/899122", "desc": "Dwight Eversley Yorke CM (born 3 November 1971) is a Tobagonian former football player.

Yorke scored 123 goals in the Premier League, a record for a non-European which was not broken until Sergio Ag\u00fcero in 2017.[3]\n\nAt international level, Yorke represented Trinidad and Tobago on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup, and also helped Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time in its history, later representing his national side in the final tournament in 2006.\n\nYorke was first discovered by Graham Taylor, at the time the Aston Villa manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke, aged 17, appeared in a team that played a friendly against Aston Villa, Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and played for the Villa Reserve and Youth sides for the majority of the 1989\u201390 season, making his First Division debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1\u20130. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the 1995\u201396 season, he then switched to centre forward and quickly established himself as one of the Premier League's top strikers.[citation needed]\n\nYorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the League Cup Final in 1996. Villa won 3\u20130 against Leeds United with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against Newcastle United in a 4\u20133 defeat. Newcastle were leading 3\u20131 at half-time and Aston Villa were down to ten men, with Mark Draper being sent off late in the first half. Yorke showed great character in leading his team in a brave fight back by scoring two more goals in the second half to complete his hat-trick, although it was to no avail as Aston Villa still lost the game. Yorke thought he had scored a fourth goal to equalise the game at 4\u20134, only for it to be ruled offside. It was performances like this that led to interest from Manchester United in August 1998. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times. He also has the distinct honour of being the last Villa player to score in front of the old Holte End standing terrace, notching both goals in a 2\u20131 victory on the final day of the 1993\u201394 season, 7 May 1994.[citation needed]\n\nThe circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker Andy Cole. Yorke then approached Gregory to state that he wanted to leave the club, to which Gregory was later attributed as saying that he would have shot Yorke if he had had a gun in his office. Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at Everton on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made no effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for \u00a312.6\u00a0million on 20 August 1998.[4]\n\nIn his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League, and forming a legendary partnership with Andy Cole.[5] Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Inter Milan,[6] and Juventus in the Champions League, and he won the Premier League Player of the Season. Yorke was also a regular member of United's 1999\u20132000 title winning team, contributing 23 goals in all competitions.[citation needed]\n\nDespite a less successful third season personally, Yorke scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3-0 victory over Derby County on 24 November 2000[7] and also netted a hat-trick in the top of the table clash with Arsenal as United went on to win a third successive title.[8] In January 2002 a move to Middlesbrough fell through.[9] He played his last game for United that month, and was not issued a squad number for the 2002\u201303 season.[10] Altogether he scored 65 goals for Manchester United in 152 appearances.[citation needed]\n\nIn July 2002, Yorke moved to Blackburn Rovers for an initial \u00a32\u00a0million, potentially rising to \u00a32.6 million; United had wanted a fee of \u00a36 million.[10] He was signed to cover the long absence of Matt Jansen from a traffic accident, and was reunited with his former United strike partner Andy Cole.[10]\n\nYorke scored 13 goals in all competitions in his first season at Ewood Park, including the winner on 26 October 2002 as Rovers won 2\u20131 at reigning champions Arsenal.[11] The following 4 January on his return to Villa Park, he scored twice in a 4\u20131 win in the FA Cup third round.[12] On 11 May, in the last game of the season, he opened a 4\u20130 win at Tottenham Hotspur as Blackburn beat Everton to sixth place and UEFA Cup qualification.[13]\n\nOn 31 August 2004, transfer deadline day, Yorke moved to Birmingham City on a one-year deal with the option of a second. Instead of a loan to Celtic, he chose to join Birmingham for a \"substantial but undisclosed fee\".[14] It was later reported as \u00a3250,000.[15]\n\nYorke scored on his home debut for Birmingham in a 1\u20131 draw against Charlton Athletic, with the equaliser seven minutes after replacing Clinton Morrison.[16] He scored again against Graeme Souness's Newcastle on 3 October.[17] However, Yorke fell out of favour at St Andrew's and was released by mutual consent in April 2005.[15]\n\nYorke immediately signed for Sydney FC,[18] with a salary of $1\u00a0million a season. He scored the first goal for Sydney FC in its first A-League regular season match, a diving header against the Melbourne Victory. Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the A-League, having won the treble with Manchester United. Yorke scored 7 goals in the A-League, with three of them being from penalty kicks. Sydney FC coach Pierre Littbarski moved Yorke into a midfield role and gave him the team captaincy.[citation needed]\n\nHe played a major role in leading Sydney FC to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final on 5 March against regional rivals Central Coast Mariners. He set up the only goal, scored by Steve Corica, in front of a sell out crowd of over 41,000 at Aussie Stadium, and was awarded the Joe Marston Medal as best player in the grand final. Yorke was the marquee player for Sydney FC \u2013 meaning that his salary fell outside the salary cap. He was also a star name for the A-League as a whole. Aside from his footballing talents, the drawing power and credibility he brought both locally and internationally proved to be beneficial for the competition in its inaugural season, leading the Football Federation Australia to use his image and name for the promotion of the A-League's second season.[citation needed]\n\nDue to the schedule of football in Australia, Yorke returned to Manchester United for training from March to June 2006, to retain fitness for the World Cup.[19]\n\nYorke returned to Sydney FC to take part in a friendly against Everton in 2010. The game was considered his 'farewell game' as he never had the chance to say a proper farewell to the fans at Sydney FC. Everton won the match 1\u20130, and Yorke was substituted midway through the second half.[20]\n\nOn 31 August 2006, Yorke's transfer to Sunderland was announced.[21] The transfer for a fee of \u00a3200,000 (A$ $500,000) re-united Yorke with ex-teammate Roy Keane, manager of Sunderland. Yorke made his debut in the home match against Leicester City and received a rapturous standing ovation from home fans when he came on as a substitute in the first half. Yorke was used as a defensive midfielder rather than his usual striker role.[22] He scored his first goal for Sunderland in the 2\u20131 loss against Stoke and was accepted by the people of Sunderland, switching on the city's Christmas lights in 2006.[citation needed]\n\nOn 2 January 2008, during Sunderland's 1\u20130 defeat to Blackburn, Yorke was given a red card by referee Rob Styles. Yorke stated several times he would like to return to the A-League, preferably Sydney FC. However, following Sydney FC's signings at the time it seemed unlikely that Sydney would have been able to fit him under the salary cap. It was reported that Yorke play for rivals Central Coast Mariners, the team bankrolled by the man who brought him to Sydney, Peter Turnbull.[23]\n\nOn 11 March 2008, it was announced that the Mariners were in \"advanced negotiations\" with Yorke to become the marquee for two years.[24] However, on 1 July he signed a new one-year contract to stay with Sunderland for the 2008\u201309 season.[25] He was named man of the match for his performance[26] against Arsenal on 4 October 2008, with Sunderland drawing 1\u20131 at home. Following Keane's departure in December 2008, Yorke and Neil Bailey were named as assistants to Ricky Sbragia.[27] Yorke was released at the end of the 2008\u201309 season.[28]\n\nYorke has completed his Level B coaching badge, and in 2010 was quoted as being interested in pursuing a career in coaching, ideally with Aston Villa.[29] On 17 April 2011 he completed the London Marathon in a time of 3 hours and 32 minutes.[30] On 14 August 2011, Yorke signed a two-year deal to work for Sky Sports as a pundit.[31]\n\nYorke was capped 72 times for the Trinidad and Tobago national team, scoring 19 goals. Along with his friend Russell Latapy, Yorke was a member of the 1989 'Strike Squad', the national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.[32] He retired from international football in 2001 after a disagreement with coach Ren\u00e9 Sim\u00f5es, who cut Yorke and Russell Latapy from the squad prior to a decisive game of the 2002 World Cup qualification, as both missed practice following a night partying.[33] However he returned to the team for the 2006 World Cup qualification campaign, in which the team qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time in their history after a 2\u20131 aggregate qualifying victory over Bahrain.[34]\n\nYorke was captain for all of Trinidad and Tobago's games at the 2006 World Cup and was man of the match in the 0\u20130 draw against Sweden, pipping his close friend Shaka Hislop to the honour despite the then West Ham goalkeeper making several world-class saves. He was one of six players in the Trinidad squad (the others being Brent Sancho, Dennis Lawrence, Chris Birchall, Carlos Edwards and Stern John) to have played every minute of the campaign. Yorke was rated the best defensive midfielder in the opening stages of the World Cup.[35]\n\nYorke announced his retirement from international football in March 2007, choosing to focus on his club career at Sunderland.[36] He captained the side in Germany, and up until his retirement. However, he made a guest return appearance for a friendly against England in June 2008 after being invited by FIFA vice-president Jack Warner.[37] On 10 July 2008, the TTFF announced Yorke's return to the national team for the 2010 World Cup qualification campaign.[38]\n\nOn 15 October 2008, he scored his first international goal after returning from retirement against the United States in a 2010 World Cup qualification match. The game ended 2\u20131 for Trinidad and Tobago. His goal was a crucial tie-breaker scored in the 79th minute, which put Trinidad and Tobago in a great situation to advance to the next qualifying stage, needing only a tie against Cuba in their final game. On 11 February 2009, Yorke scored a 26th-minute penalty for his country, but was sent off in the dying seconds of Trinidad and Tobago's opening match of 2010 World Cup qualification against El Salvador (2\u20132) after exchanging heated remarks with Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez (the Trini star had voiced his disapproval of the disruptions caused by the home crowd) and was consequently banned for four games due to his use of abusive language. The suspension was later reduced to two matches.[39]\n\nAfter being released from Sunderland and being unable to find a club before the end of the current transfer window, Yorke retired from football altogether in September 2009, and took up the post of assistant manager with the Trinidad and Tobago national team.[40]\n\nOn 21 April 2019, Yorke was interviewed for the vacant role at National league side Sutton United, Sutton would appoint Matt Gray Instead.[41]\n\nOn 12 November 2021, Aston Villa appointed Steven Gerrard as their new manager. Yorke said he was disappointed not to be hired instead.[42]\n\nOn 21 April 2022 it was revealed that Yorke was being considered for the vacant manager's position at Perth Glory in the Australian A-League Men. Yorke responded to the speculation by stating \"I don't want to be just handed the job on the back of my playing achievements. I want to earn the job the traditional Perth Glory way - by being hired as an assistant then taking over once the head coach gets sacked and the club has carried out a worldwide search.\"[43]\n\nOn 25 May 2022, Yorke managed the A-Leagues All Stars in their 3\u20132 loss against FC Barcelona.[44]\n\nOn 1 July 2022, Yorke became the new manager of A-League Men side Macarthur FC, replacing Ante Milicic to become the club\u2019s second ever manager.[45] Exactly three months later, he led the club towards its first ever trophy after winning the 2022 Australia Cup Final.\n\nYorke left the Bulls in January 2023, the day after a 1\u20130 loss to Adelaide United.[46]\n\nYorke grew up as a Tottenham Hotspur fan and his first jersey was a white Tottenham Hotspur shirt.[47]\n\nYorke was once in a brief relationship with former model turned writer Katie Price; they have a son, Harvey, who was born in May 2002. He is autistic, partially blind and has the genetic disorder Prader\u2013Willi syndrome.[48] In a 2009 interview, Yorke conceded being unfaithful to Price during their relationship, and subsequently playing no role in the upbringing of their son. He has not claimed paternity.[49]\n\nThe Dwight Yorke Stadium in Bacolet, Tobago, constructed for the 2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship, was named in Yorke's honour. Yorke is a cricket fan. One of Yorke's closest friends is Brian Lara. During the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Yorke made regular appearances bringing on drinks for the West Indies cricket team. Yorke's older brother, Clint Yorke, is a former first-class cricketer who has represented the Trinidad and Tobago national cricket team as an opening batsman.[50]\n\nYorke featured extensively in an episode of Australia's The Biggest Loser, which aired on 28 February 2006. The episode involved Yorke coaching the \"red team\" of contestants while they competed against the \"blue team\" in a game of football. Mark Rudan, Yorke's Sydney FC teammate, was the manager of the \"blue team\".[citation needed]\n\nAs a member of the squad that competed at the 2006 World Cup, Yorke was awarded the Chaconia Medal (Gold Class), the second highest state decoration of Trinidad and Tobago.[51] He was also made a Sports Ambassador for the country.[citation needed]\n\nYorke released his autobiography, Born to Score, in 2009.[52]\n\nIn December 2018, Yorke avoided bankruptcy by paying a \u00a31.5 million debt to HM Revenue and Customs.[53]\n\nAston Villa\n\nManchester United\n\nSydney FC\n\nSunderland\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\nIndividual\n\nMacarthur FC\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Yorke"}, {"id": 112, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/105/2098826/original/stewart-downing-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Stewart Downing", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/stewart-downing/2098826", "desc": "Stewart Downing (born 22 July 1984) is an English former professional footballer.

Downing had played more recently as an attacking midfielder.\n\nDowning started his career at Middlesbrough, where after a loan at Sunderland, he became a key part of the team, winning the League Cup in 2004 and helping them to the UEFA Cup final two years later. In 2009, after Boro's relegation, he joined Aston Villa for an initial \u00a310 million, then moved on to Liverpool for twice that amount two years later, again winning the League Cup in 2012. He played for two seasons at West Ham United before returning to Middlesbrough, where he won promotion to the Premier League. In 2019, he was released by Middlesbrough after 404 total appearances, and signed for Blackburn Rovers.\n\nA full international from 2005 to 2014, Downing earned 35 caps for England. He was included in the nation's squads that reached the quarter-finals at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He announced his retirement in August 2021.\n\nDowning was born in Middlesbrough, Cleveland, and was a graduate of the Middlesbrough Academy.[2]\n\nDowning signed his first professional contract on 6 September 2001.[2] His debut came on 24 April 2002 in a Premier League match away to Ipswich Town, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1\u20130 loss at Portman Road.[4] He was limited to just three appearances during the 2001\u201302 season, plus a further three in the following 2002\u201303 season.[5][6] His first senior goal came on 1 October 2002 in a 4\u20131 League Cup second round away victory over Brentford, coming on as a substitute to conclude the scoring at Griffin Park.[7]\n\nOn 30 October 2003, Downing went on a one-month loan to Sunderland, of the First Division.[8] He scored three goals in seven matches for Mick McCarthy's Black Cats team, starting on 4 November when he equalised in a 3\u20131 win at Gillingham, also assisting John Oster.[9]\n\nHaving scored as many goals on his loan as Middlesbrough's top scorer Szil\u00e1rd N\u00e9meth had recorded all season, Downing was recalled from his loan on 11 December due to injury to Juninho.[10] He was a regular for the remainder of the season, but was an unused substitute on 29 February 2004, when they won the 2004 League Cup Final against Bolton Wanderers.[11]\n\nThe 2004\u201305 season saw Downing make 49 appearances, scoring six goals, as well as providing numerous assists.[citation needed] In a UEFA Cup match against Lazio in November 2004, both Downing and Zenden were in the starting line-up.[12] Though Zenden scored both goals in the 2\u20130 victory, Downing drew praise for his performance down the left.[12] Such performances that season saw him called up to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's England squad in February 2005 for a friendly against the Netherlands.[13]\n\nA knee injury saw Downing sidelined for five months at the end of 2005,[14] though he returned to play his part in the run to the 2006 UEFA Cup Final, including three assists in the 4\u20132 (4\u20133 agg) victory over Steaua Bucure\u0219ti in the semi-final second leg.[15] He started in the final as Middlesbrough were beaten 4\u20130 by Sevilla at the Philips Stadion.[16]\n\nOn 26 February 2008, Downing signed a new five-year contract, keeping him signed on at Middlesbrough until summer 2013.[17] With the departure of Mark Schwarzer in May 2008, Downing became Middlesbrough's second longest serving player after Brad Jones.[citation needed]\n\nThe 2008\u201309 season was a mixed one for Downing.[citation needed] Middlesbrough had their best start to the season in six years which saw them climb to 8th in the table, however, a terrible winless run which started in November 2008 saw them fall into the relegation zone.[citation needed] On 5 January 2009, he handed in a written transfer request expressing his desire to leave the club but the request was turned down on the same day.[18] In the penultimate match of the season, he sustained a foot injury after a challenge from Stiliyan Petrov in a home match against Aston Villa in May 2009, which needed an operation, ruling him out for at least four months.[19] After spending the whole of the second half of the season in the relegation zone, Middlesbrough were relegated on the final day after they lost 2\u20131 away at West Ham United.[20] Downing, having started every league match, except the last match, ended the season with no league goals, having only scored two against West Ham United in the FA Cup.[21][22]\n\nFollowing Middlesbrough's relegation, Downing signed a four-year contract with Aston Villa, becoming Martin O'Neill's first signing of the 2009 Summer transfer window for a fee of \u00a310\u00a0million with an extra \u00a32\u00a0million to be paid depending on appearances.[23] On 7 November 2009, O'Neill announced that Downing had returned to full training following his injury against Villa while playing for Middlesbrough during 2008\u201309.[citation needed] Downing made his Aston Villa debut on as a 69th-minute substitute for Steve Sidwell in the away match against Burnley.[24] He scored his first goal for Villa in the League Cup fourth round tie against Portsmouth at Fratton Park on 1 December 2009.[25]\n\nDowning's return to action saw him returning to his preferred left wing role, with James Milner moving to central midfield for Villa.[citation needed] Downing played in Villa's first win at Old Trafford against Manchester United since 1983 on 12 December 2009 in their 1\u20130 victory over the Red Devils.[26] Downing then went on to score his first and second league goal for Villa in their 5\u20132 win against Burnley on 2 February 2010.[27] His second season with Aston Villa had been a much improved one,[citation needed] he scored the first Premier League goal of the season against West Ham United at Villa Park on 14 August in a 3\u20130 win.[28] In the final match of the season, Downing scored his eighth against Liverpool at Villa Park with the result ending 1\u20130; during the 2010\u201311 season, Downing made 44 appearances and scored eight goals in all competitions.[29] Downing was the subject of speculation over the summer, with Liverpool showing interest in the winger. On 6 July, Liverpool tabled a bid of \u00a315\u00a0million for Downing but this was rejected by Villa, who said they would not let Downing go for less than \u00a320m.[30]\nNew Villa manager Alex McLeish then stated that Downing was not for sale and he would not be leaving Villa in the summer.[31] However, on 13 July 2011, a fee was agreed between Aston Villa and Liverpool for the transfer of Downing.[32]\n\nDowning completed his move to Liverpool on 15 July 2011, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around \u00a320\u00a0million.[33] On 13 August 2011, Downing made his debut in Liverpool's first match of the 2011\u201312 Premier League, in a 1\u20131 draw against Sunderland at Anfield, playing the full 90 minutes.[citation needed] On 20 August 2011, he started and played the full 90 minutes against Arsenal in a 2\u20130 victory at the Emirates Stadium.[34] On 6 January 2012, Downing scored his first goal for Liverpool against Oldham Athletic at Anfield in the third round of the FA Cup.[35] On 26 February he won the League Cup with Liverpool, scoring his penalty in the shoot-out and winning the Alan Hardaker Trophy as Man of the Match.[36] On 18 March 2012 he scored the winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Stoke City in the FA Cup quarter-final, securing a second Wembley visit for Liverpool in the semi-finals in what was described as \"his most telling Liverpool contribution\" so far.[37]\n\nDowning scored the winner in Liverpool's first match of 2012\u201313, a left foot shot in a UEFA Europa League match against Gomel.[38] On 30 August 2012, Downing was deployed as a left back against Hearts.[39] He scored the winning and only goal against Anzhi Makhachkala at Anfield in the Europa League. After the match, he was praised by manager Brendan Rodgers saying \"It's been a tough time. He's had a rough ride but he's an important member of our team.\"[40] On 22 December, he made his first league assist and scored his first league goal in a 4\u20130 win against Fulham.[41] He scored his second league goal for the club on 2 March 2013, opening the scoring in a 4\u20130 win away to Wigan Athletic, with a header from a Philippe Coutinho cross.[42] In Liverpool's next match, Downing scored the equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur, in a 3\u20132 home victory for Liverpool.[43] This marked Downing's fifth goal in all competitions and his last goal for Liverpool.[44]\n\nOn 13 August 2013, Downing signed a four-year contract with West Ham United for an undisclosed fee which was reported to be in the region of \u00a35m.[45][46] He made his debut for the club, coming on as a substitute for Matt Jarvis in the 2\u20130 home win against Cardiff City at Upton Park on the opening day of the 2013\u201314 season on 17 August 2013.[47]\nDowning scored his first goal for West Ham on 3 May 2014 in a 2\u20130 home win against Tottenham Hotspur.[48]\n\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, Downing scored his first goal of the season against Crystal Palace in a 3\u20131 away win on 23 August 2014.[49] Downing continued his fine form for West Ham in a diamond formation which saw him being deployed in a central role.[50] On 1 November 2014, Downing scored for West Ham against Stoke City in a 2\u20132 away draw, with West Ham coming from two goals down to draw 2\u20132.[51] Downing scored his third goal of the season against Sunderland in a 1\u20131 draw away from home on 13 December 2014.[52] A week later, he scored against Leicester City, curling a left-footed shot from 20 yards as West Ham won 2\u20130.[citation needed]\n\nOn 16 July 2015, Downing returned to boyhood club Middlesbrough, signing a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of \u00a35.5 million, potentially rising to \u00a37 million if the club were to gain promotion to the Premier League.[53][54] The first match of his return was on 9 August 2015, a goalless draw away to Preston North End in the first Championship match of the season.[55] On 12 September 2015, he netted the first goal of his second spell, to open a 2\u20130 win over Milton Keynes Dons at the Riverside.[56] Middlesbrough secured promotion on the final day of the season, after a 1\u20131 draw with promotion rivals Brighton & Hove Albion at home, gaining automatic promotion as runners-up.[57]\n\nDowning faced competition ahead of the club's first season back in the top flight with the signings of Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez,[58] Viktor Fischer and Adama Traor\u00e9.[59][60] In January 2017, Middlesbrough announced that they would allow Downing to leave on loan during that winter transfer window, as Downing had not been a regular starter throughout the league campaign.[61] Despite interest from Crystal Palace, no move materialised and Downing remained at the club.[62] Downing suffered a second relegation with Middlesbrough, when they were relegated back down to the Championship.[63]\n\nAfter relegation, Downing was informed by new manager Garry Monk that he could leave the club.[64] Birmingham City manager Harry Redknapp offered Downing a two-year contract,[65] with Redknapp stating that he is a \"keen admirer\" of the player.[66] The transfer fell through, though Downing soon regained his place at Middlesbrough after Tony Pulis replaced Monk in December.[67] Downing was one of four players released by Middlesbrough at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, having totalled 404 appearances in his two spells at the club.[68]\n\nDowning signed for Championship club Blackburn Rovers on 21 June 2019 on a one-year contract.[69] He scored his first goal for Blackburn in an EFL Cup second round tie against Oldham Athletic on 13 August, a 3\u20132 home win.[70] Despite being an ever-present throughout the 2019\u201320 season, Downing's departure from the club was announced on 24 June 2020 on the expiration of his contract.[71]\n\nDespite his previous exit, Downing signed a new contract with Blackburn that November.[72] He once again left the club at the end of his existing contract, this confirmed days after the 2020\u201321 season concluded.[73] After his departure was confirmed, Downing stated that he was pondering his future in football, though admitted that he would \"probably\" retire which he did in August 2021.[74][75]\n\nDowning was first called up as a 19-year-old for the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Championship.[citation needed] With seven under-21 caps to his name, Downing made his England debut on 9 February 2005 in a home friendly, played at Villa Park against the Netherlands, replacing Shaun Wright-Phillips in the second half.[76]\n\nDowning's international career took a setback in May 2005 when he was injured during a training session with England on their tour of the United States, keeping him out of action until 2006.[citation needed] Downing was included in the England World Cup squad in May 2006 by Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson,[77] primarily as a back-up for Joe Cole, and came on as a second-half substitute in England's victorious opening match against Paraguay.[78] He was brought on once again in the match against Trinidad and Tobago, when England scored two goals in the last ten minutes.[79]\n\nOn 16 August 2006, Downing made his first start for England, as Greece were beaten by 4\u20130, with Downing involved in three of the goals.[80] He started the subsequent three Euro 2008 qualifiers, against Andorra and Macedonia.[citation needed] Downing hoped to have proven many of his critics wrong after Fabio Capello became the third successive England manager to give him an England cap, on 26 March 2008 in a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to France.[81] He was also called up (alongside Middlesbrough teammate David Wheater) for Capello's friendlies against United States and Trinidad and Tobago, where he received the nod ahead of Ashley Young. His performance justified his selection by contributing with the first two goals and won praise from the press who had previously slated his inclusion in the squad.[82] A few months after Capello took charge of England, the Italian manager stated that he had been most impressed by Downing.[83][84] He was chosen again by Capello to replace Aaron Lennon for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on 12 October 2010.[85] During his second season with Aston Villa, Downing began to feature regularly for England under Capello.[citation needed]\n\nAfter his transfer to Liverpool, he featured in the two qualifying matches at the start of the season, a 3\u20130 win against Bulgaria, and a 1\u20130 win against Wales in which he provided the assist for the only goal of the match scored by former Aston Villa teammate Ashley Young.[86] He also came on at half-time to replace Theo Walcott in the 1\u20130 win against Spain and started the following match against Sweden which England also won 1\u20130.[87][88] On 16 May 2012, new England manager Roy Hodgson named Downing in his 23-man squad for the upcoming UEFA Euro 2012 tournament.[89] He started in a 1\u20130 win away to Norway on 26 May, which was Hodgson's first match in charge of England.[90] Downing did not make an appearance during UEFA Euro 2012.[91] Having not appeared in a squad since 2012, in November 2014 Downing was called into the squad for England's matches against Slovenia and Scotland.[92]\n\nDowning has been involved in several charitable and community projects outside his playing career. He supports the nationwide No Messin' campaign, along with freestyler Colin Nell and boxer Amir Khan, warning youngsters against playing on railway lines. Downing held a charity dinner with special guest boxer Ricky Hatton to raise funds for the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne in February 2008.[93] The hospital had cared for Vicky, Stewart's sister, who died of leukaemia in 1993 at the age of 4. The honorary position of president of Middlesbrough Futsal Club was bestowed on Downing in December 2007. During his spare time Downing has DJ-ed at several nightclubs in Middlesbrough[94] while also playing sets in Ibiza among other places.[95]\n\nDowning's former agent Ian Elliott was arrested by Cleveland Police in September 2008 after he was reported to the police by the player himself after he had concerns \"regarding the way his and his company's affairs [had] been handled\". He told Middlesbrough about his concerns some time earlier and the club advised him to involve lawyers and accountants to investigate, while The Football Association acted as liaison between the police and the club.[96]\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nAston Villa\n\nLiverpool\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Downing"}, {"id": 113, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/38/747336/original/clint-hill-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Clint Hill", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/clint-hill/747336", "desc": "Clinton Scott Hill (born 19 October 1978) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender.

He is currently assistant manager of National League side Stockport County.\n\nHill began his career with local side Tranmere Rovers in 1997. He broke into the first team and became a regular as Rovers reached the League Cup final in 2000. Hill was sent-off however as Tranmere lost 2\u20131. He remained at Prenton Park until 2002 when he joined Oldham Athletic and after impressing there he was signed by Championship side Stoke City. His first season with Stoke was cut down due to injuries which hampered his time at the club. He left for Crystal Palace after making 84 appearances for Stoke in five years.\n\nAt Palace he played well despite the club struggling financially and when manager Neil Warnock joined Queens Park Rangers Hill followed him in July 2010. In his first season at Loftus Road QPR won the Championship and gained promotion to the Premier League. They went on to ensure survival on the final day of the season, Hill winning the supporters player of the year award for his performances this despite playing 25 matches and also spending a short time on loan at Nottingham Forest.\n\nBorn in Huyton, Merseyside, Hill began his career as a trainee at Tranmere Rovers, where he made his debut during a 2\u20132 draw against Nottingham Forest in the 1997\u201398 season. By the 1998\u201399 season Hill had become a regular starter in the Tranmere side and was part of the team which played in the 2000 English League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium against Leicester City. However Hill was sent-off during the game and Tranmere lost the match 2\u20131.[3] Hill made 140 appearances during his five years in the Tranmere first team.\n\nA\u00a3250,000 move to Oldham Athletic in 2002[4] saw him make just 17 league starts in one season before it was cut short when Hill broke his leg during a League Cup tie against Crystal Palace in December 2002, which kept him sidelined for the remainder of the 2002\u201303 season. Hill scored one league goal for the Latics, ironically against Tranmere.[5] Hill was then given a \u00a3120,000 move to Stoke City during the summer of 2003.[6]\n\nHill's first season at Stoke City was disrupted with injury and he was forced to sit out a lot of the 2003\u201304 season,[7] making only nine first team starts and three substitute appearances. However Hill impressed during his second season at Stoke with his defensive ability and won the club's player of the year award for the 2004\u201305 season.\n\nHowever, Hill's career at Stoke was hindered by recurring knee injuries, he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament towards the end of the 2004\u201305 season which prevented him from playing again until late into the 2005\u201306 season,[8] however he made an immediate impact on his return, forging a strong partnership with Michael Duberry in central defence.\n\nHe found himself unable to hold down a regular first place during the 2006\u201307 season, with Danny Higginbotham and Michael Duberry preferred to him as first choice central defenders and Andy Griffin occupying the left-back slot. He made the majority of his appearances during the 2006\u201307 season as a stand-in left-back. However, Hill's season was brought to a premature end when he required a further operation on the same knee he injured in 2005.\n\nHe remained at Stoke for the first half of the following season, although he joined Crystal Palace on loan in October. Ironically, his last outing for Stoke was a late appearance as a substitute in a victory at Palace.\n\nHill's move to join Neil Warnock's Eagles was for an initial period of two months. After impressing hugely, he then made the move permanent for an undisclosed fee in January 2008.[9] He established himself as first choice left back, and became a fan's favourite due to his professional and committed attitude. After an extremely successful first season at Palace, where they made the Play-off semi-finals, Hill continued his superb consistency in the 2008\u201309 season. Despite his performances, Palace finished in a disappointing 15th place in the Championship table.[10] An equally disappointing season 2009\u201310 witnessed Palace in severe financial plight with a consequential ten points deduction and a final position in the division of 21st.[11]\n\nOn 1 July 2010, Hill left Palace on a free transfer to join Queens Park Rangers[12] and reunited with his former boss Neil Warnock. On 7 August 2010, Hill made his QPR debut in a 4\u20130 win over Barnsley where he got his first clean sheet. Hill scored his first goal for QPR against Portsmouth on 1 February 2011.[13] Hill played over thirty games for the Hoops and made the left back position firmly his. He scored his second goal for QPR in a 2\u20130 home win against Ipswich Town, in a game where he also set up a goal for Hei\u00f0ar Helguson to seal the win.[14]\n\nAfter QPR sealed the Championship title,[15] Hill was able to play in the Premier League for the first time in his career. However, he was sent off on the opening day of the season for a headbutt on Martin Petrov of Bolton Wanderers in a 4\u20130 defeat at Loftus Road.[16] On 20 September 2011, Hill signed for Nottingham Forest on a 93-day emergency loan deal,[17][18] given squad number three.[19] Due to injuries to Matthew Connolly and Danny Gabbidon, Hill was recalled early from his loan spell at Forest.[20][21] Hill played for Forest five times. After his return from the loan spell, and the appointment of Mark Hughes as manager, Hill became a regular in the Rangers starting 11, forming a strong central defensive partnership with Anton Ferdinand. On 10 March 2012, Hill was denied what would have been his first Premier League goal when his header away to relegation rivals Bolton clearly crossed the line, but the linesman failed to spot this and a goal was not awarded. QPR went on to lose the game 2\u20131. Hill was 'gutted' about having been denied a first Premier League goal.[22]\n\nAt the end of the 2011\u201312 season QPR survived on the final day of the season despite a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester City. Hill was awarded both the fans and players player of the season awards for his outstanding performances for Rangers in the 2011\u201312 season.[23] Hill's contract was due to expire in the summer of 2012 however Hill was keen to stay at Loftus Road.[24] In May 2012, Hill was offered a new contract by QPR.[25] On 19 June 2012 Clint signed a new one-year contract extension at the club until 2013.[26]\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season saw Hill in and out of the starting 11 under Mark Hughes; however, he has been ever present in the team since Harry Redknapp took over as manager with Rangers in deep relegation trouble. He was handed the captaincy by Redknapp taking over from Park Ji-Sung.[27] QPR failed to move out of the relegation zone and were relegated to the Championship after a 0\u20130 draw at Reading on 28 April 2013.[28]\n\nHill remained captain for the 2013\u201314 season. He started games at both centre-back and left-back, scoring his first goal in two and a half years in the 1\u20130 win away to Leeds at Elland Road. He scored the winning goal once again on 2 November in a 2\u20131 victory over Derby County. Hill captained the team at Wembley as Rangers won the Championship Play-off final 1\u20130 against Derby County.[29] Hill again signed a one-year deal to captain the club for their season back in the Premier League. On 7 April 2015 Hill scored his first Premier League goal, rising above the Aston Villa defence to head Matt Phillips' corner past Brad Guzan in the 55th minute to make the game 2\u20132, the final score was 3\u20133.[30] After appearing 15 times in the 2015\u201316 season he was told his contract would not be renewed and as of now[when?] is a free agent. His last game for the R's was a 1\u20130 win at home to Bristol City, helping the club finish 12th in their first season back in the second tier.[31]\n\nOn 17 June 2016, Hill joined Scottish Premiership side Rangers on a one-year deal preceding his release from Queens Park Rangers.[32] He made his debut for the club in a League Cup match against Annan Athletic on 19 July.[33] In doing so, Hill became the oldest debutant in the club's history, aged 37\u00a0years, 274\u00a0days.[34] He broke a twenty-one-year-old record held by goalkeeper Billy Thomson who was aged 37\u00a0years, 50\u00a0days when he made his maiden Rangers appearance.[35]\n\nHill scored his first goals for Rangers with a brace in a Scottish League Cup tie against Peterhead on 9 August 2016.[36] He scored his first league goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with Ross County on 6 November.[37] This goal, at the age of 38 years and 10 days, made Hill the oldest scorer in the Scottish Premiership since Lee Bullen netted at the age of 38 years and 238 days for Falkirk against Hamilton Academical in 2009. Hill was sent-off for the first time as a Rangers player, in injury time, during a league match against Aberdeen after receiving two cautions.[38] After some solid displays for Rangers, Hill was linked to a move back to Queen's Park Rangers in December 2016, with the Loftus Road club reportedly seeking to sign him on a pre-contract agreement with a view to rejoining them on a free transfer in the summer of 2017.[39]\n\nHill scored a late equaliser in the Old Firm derby against Celtic on 12 March 2017, as the match finished 1\u20131.[40]\n\nHill signed a short-term contract with Carlisle United in September 2017. In May 2018, he announced his retirement from football after leaving Carlisle United.[41][42]\n\nOn 21 May 2018, he was appointed as joint First Team Coach at Fleetwood Town alongside former Rochdale manager Steve Eyre.[43]\n\nHill left Fleetwood in January 2021 when then manager Joey Barton was relieved of his duties.[44] On 22 February, he followed Barton and Andy Mangan to join Bristol Rovers.[45] On 14 August 2021, following a 2\u20130 home defeat to Stevenage, it was announced that Hill had left the club due to personal family reasons.[46]\n\nIn October 2021, Hill was appointed assistant manager at League Two club Hartlepool United.[47] Hill left the club a month later following the departure of manager Dave Challinor.[48] The following day Hill followed Challinor to Stockport County in the role of assistant manager.[49]\n\nTranmere Rovers\n\nQueens Park Rangers\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Hill_(footballer)"}, {"id": 114, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/66/1319472/original/1319472-photo-u2?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Jonny Evans", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/jonny-evans/1319472", "desc": "Jonathan Grant Evans (born 3 January 1988) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a defender for Premier League club Leicester City and the Northern Ireland national team.

He went on loan to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland to gain first-team experience before making his Manchester United first-team debut in the 2007\u201308 League Cup.[3] He became a regular first-team squad member the following season, and played almost 200 matches for Manchester United in an eight-year spell; however, he fell out of favour at the club under manager Louis van Gaal and left for West Bromwich Albion. After West Brom's relegation three years later, Evans signed for Leicester City. \n\nEvans is the second-most decorated player in Northern Irish football history.[4][5] He has played 100 matches for the Northern Ireland national team, and was ever-present in the team's run to the round of 16 at UEFA Euro 2016.\n\nEvans was scouted while playing for Greenisland F.C., the same club that his younger brother Corry and Craig Cathcart played for before moving to Manchester United.[6][7] At the age of nine, he was invited to attend the Manchester United Centre of Excellence in Belfast, before being invited for a trial in Manchester a year later. Rule changes within The Football Association at the time meant that clubs were limited to players who lived within 90 minutes' travel of the club, so Evans' opportunities were limited. However, his family soon relocated to Manchester, allowing Evans to train with Manchester United full-time. He progressed through Manchester United's academy, featuring in two of the club's three games during the 2006 summer tour of South Africa, as well as domestic friendlies against Celtic and Preston North End. Evans also made a surprise appearance in the Amsterdam Tournament against Ajax.\n\nAlongside fellow youngsters Darron Gibson, Danny Simpson and Fraizer Campbell, Evans spent the first half of the 2006\u201307 season on loan at Manchester United's Belgian feeder club Royal Antwerp.[8]\n\nIn December 2006, he agreed to join Sunderland on loan in the January transfer window until the end of the 2006\u201307 season,[9] again along with Danny Simpson. The pair helped Sunderland clinch the Championship title, with Evans winning the club's Youth Player of the Year award at the end of the season. Sunderland manager Roy Keane was hopeful of re-signing the young centre-back on another loan following their promotion to the Premier League, though United elected to keep him at the club to push for a place in the first team.[10]\n\nEvans ultimately rejoined Sunderland for a second loan spell on 4 January 2008, and was immediately drafted into the first team squad in a 3\u20130 loss to Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup.[11] He played the full 90 minutes but was criticised for Wigan's second goal of the game, prior to which he lost the ball on the edge of his own box, resulting in a deflected own goal by Paul McShane.[12] Making 15 league appearances, Evans helped Sunderland avoid relegation back to the Championship.\n\nEvans made his Manchester United debut on 26 September 2007 against Coventry City in the League Cup which ended in a 2\u20130 defeat. He then appeared as a late substitute for Gerard Piqu\u00e9 in a UEFA Champions League match at home to Dynamo Kyiv on 7 November 2007 to secure Manchester United's qualification to the knockout stage of the competition. He subsequently made his first Champions League start on 12 December 2007 against Roma.[citation needed]\n\nEvans made his league debut for United in a 1\u20131 draw with Chelsea on 21 September 2008, filling in for the suspended Nemanja Vidi\u0107.[13] In December 2008, Evans made two substitute appearances at the FIFA Club World Cup, including one in the final after Vidi\u0107 was sent off shortly after half-time. Evans continued to deputise throughout the rest of the season, appearing in a number of league games and in the League Cup final.[citation needed]\n\nAt the beginning of the 2010\u201311 football season, Evans became a regular fixture in the United team, partnering Vidi\u0107 in the centre of defence in the absence of the injured Rio Ferdinand. On 19 March 2011, Evans injured Bolton Wanderers midfielder Stuart Holden with a tackle which ruled Holden out initially for six months, though eventually caused the United States international to be sidelined for 22 months. Despite Evans receiving a straight red card for the tackle, Manchester United went on to win the game 1\u20130 with a Dimitar Berbatov goal.[14]\n\nBefore the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Evans was handed the number 6 shirt after Wes Brown was transferred to Sunderland.[15] On 14 August, he wore his new shirt number for the first time in United's opening day 2\u20131 win at West Bromwich Albion, coming on for the injured Vidi\u0107 in the 52nd minute at The Hawthorns.[16] On 23 October, he was sent off in United's 6\u20131 defeat against Manchester City after bringing down Mario Balotelli in a last-man challenge.[17] Evans made his 100th appearance for the Red Devils on 30 November, playing the full 120 minutes as United lost 2\u20131 to Championship side Crystal Palace in the League Cup quarter-final.[18] On 18 March 2012, he scored his first goal for United, opening the scoring in a 5\u20130 league win away to Wolverhampton Wanderers.[19] Evans missed the final three games of the season with a foot injury.[20]\n\nHaving undergone surgery to repair an ankle injury at the end of the previous season, Evans was unable to commence his preseason training until early August. Evans scored his second goal for the club in a 3\u20130 win away at Newcastle United on 7 October 2012, thumping home a header from a Robin van Persie corner. On 23 October, he scored his first UEFA Champions League goal and his first at Old Trafford, scrambling home from a corner kick the 2-2 equaliser in a 3\u20132 victory over Braga. Evans netted his third goal of the season on 24 November 2012, heading in the equaliser from a corner to begin a 3\u20131 comeback victory against Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford.[21] On 21 December 2012, Evans signed a new contract with United which would keep him at the club until June 2016.[22] He scored his third league goal of the season and fourth overall on Boxing Day in a 4\u20133 win against Newcastle, tapping home after Javier Hern\u00e1ndez's shot had been saved by Tim Krul. He scored an own goal moments later, turning into his own net a cross from former United, Antwerp and Sunderland teammate Danny Simpson.[23]\n\nOn 4 March 2015, Newcastle striker Papiss Ciss\u00e9 spat at Evans after Evans spat in Ciss\u00e9's direction following an altercation. Neither player was punished by the referee during the game, though both were charged by the FA after review. Evans denied the charge and said \"I would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Ciss\u00e9. Having woken up this morning, I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night's match.\" He was banned for six games on 7 March, with Ciss\u00e9 banned for seven due to a previous suspension.[24]\n\nEvans signed for Premier League club West Bromwich Albion for an undisclosed fee on 29 August 2015.[25] He made his debut for the club on 12 September 2015 in a 0\u20130 draw against Southampton.[26] On 2 January 2016, Evans scored his first West Brom goal in a 2\u20131 victory over Stoke City.[27] On 15 May 2016, before the final game of the season, he received the Players' Player of the Season award for his first season at the club.[28]\n\nHe had to wait a long time for his next goal, which came in a 3\u20131 win over Watford on 3 December 2016.[29] His next goal came in a 2\u20131 loss against Swansea on the final game of the season.[30]\n\nIn July 2017, following the departure of club skipper Darren Fletcher to Stoke City,[31] Evans was confirmed permanent captain by head coach Tony Pulis.[32] He scored his first goal of the season on 30 September 2017 in a 2\u20132 draw against Watford, scoring a header as he had done ten months earlier against the same opponent.[33] His second goal of the season was against Brighton at home on 13 January 2018, which brought his side's first league win in five months and 20 games.[34]\n\nIn June 2018, Leicester City triggered the \u00a33.5\u00a0million relegation release clause in Evans' West Brom contract. He signed a three-year contract with the Foxes,[35] and made his Leicester debut in a 2\u20130 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers on 18 August 2018.[36] He scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20131 defeat to Crystal Palace on 23 February 2019.[37]\n\nEvans made his 400th appearance in English football on 12 July 2020 and scored an own goal in a 1\u20134 defeat away to AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League.[38]\n\nAhead of the 2022\u201323 season, Evans was appointed captain following the departure of previous captain Kasper Schmeichel.[39]\n\nDespite having not yet made his senior debut for Manchester United, Evans was called up to the full Northern Ireland squad for the first time in September 2006, making his debut in the memorable 3\u20132 victory over Spain.[40] On 28 March 2009, Evans scored his first international goal in a 3\u20132 win over Poland in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, volleying home from close range.[41]\n\nOn 28 May 2016, Evans was included by national team manager Michael O'Neill in Northern Ireland's final 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016.[42] This was the first time Northern Ireland had ever been involved in the finals of the competition, and their first major tournament since the 1986 FIFA World Cup. The team eventually reached the last 16, being knocked out by Wales after a 1\u20130 defeat.[43] Evans participated in all four of Northern Ireland's games in the tournament.\n\nHis second international goal came eight and a half years after his first on 4 September 2017, via a header in a 2\u20130 victory against the Czech Republic in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification. Northern Ireland reached a November playoff versus Switzerland, aiming to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 32 years. They suffered a 1\u20130 defeat in the first leg with the winner coming from a controversial penalty awarded by Romanian referee Ovidiu Hategan. Corry Evans was penalised for handball, though the ball clearly struck the player's shoulder; manager Michael O'Neill said it was the worst decision he had ever seen in a game he had been involved in.[44] A goalless draw in the second leg three days later meant Northern Ireland were eliminated from qualification. Evans nearly scored a winner in injury time of the second leg which would have levelled the aggregate score; his header beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer but was cleared off the line by defender Ricardo Rodriguez, who had converted the penalty in the first leg.[45]\n\nEvans scored his third goal at senior international level when he opened the scoring against Belarus in Northern Ireland's second game of the qualification phase for UEFA Euro 2020.[46] On 27 September 2022 in the Nations League game against Greece, he became the fourth player to make 100 appearances for Northern Ireland.[47]\n\nEvans was born in Belfast.[48] He was a student at Belfast High School in Newtownabbey before being enrolled at Ashton-on-Mersey School in Sale, Greater Manchester, once he had been signed by Manchester United. He holds nine GCSEs, all A* or A grades.[49]\n\nOn 19 December 2007, Evans was arrested in connection with an alleged rape that occurred at the hotel where Manchester United's Christmas party was held.[50] On 8 March 2008, it was reported that he would not be prosecuted for any offence.[51]\n\nOn 1 June 2013, Evans married Helen McConnell, an MUTV reporter, at Clough Presbyterian Church.[52] As of December 2019, the couple had three children.[53]\n\nSunderland\n\nManchester United\n\nLeicester City\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Evans"}, {"id": 115, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/43/855515/original/diego-cavalieri-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Diego Cavalieri", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/diego-cavalieri/855515", "desc": "Diego Cavalieri  (born 1 December 1982) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Botafogo. \nCavalieri is of Italian ancestry and holds both an Italian and Brazilian passport.

Cavalieri played 33 times in the Brazilian Championship.[4]\n\nOn 11 July 2008, he signed a four-year contract with Liverpool for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of \u00a33\u00a0million.[5][6]\n\nCavalieri became the third Brazilian player at the club, following the signings of F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio and Lucas. Upon his arrival, he was handed the number 1 shirt, last worn by Jerzy Dudek.[7] Cavalieri made his competitive debut on 23 September 2008 against Crewe Alexandra in the third round of the League Cup. He made his UEFA Champions League debut on 9 December against PSV and his FA Cup debut against Preston North End almost a month later. Cavalieri appeared four times during the 2009\u201310 season, taking his total of appearances to eight for the club, though he never made an appearance in the Premier League. On 29 July, Cavalieri played the full 90 minutes in Liverpool's first leg of their UEFA Europa League third qualifying round tie against Macedonian side Rabotni\u010dki. Liverpool won 2\u20130 thanks to a David N'Gog header and a Steven Gerrard penalty.\n\nOn 18 August 2010, then Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson confirmed Cavalieri would join Cesena after the Europa League tie against Trabzonspor. Cavalieri had been unable to dislodge Pepe Reina at Anfield since the Brazilian keeper joined Liverpool from Palmeiras in 2008. The deal was confirmed on 23 August 2010, with Brad Jones taking the vacated number 1 shirt. He left Anfield for an undisclosed fee, having played ten games in two years for Liverpool, none in the Premier League.[8] Cavalieri did not feature in a Serie A game during his six-month stint with Cesena, with head coach Massimo Ficcadenti preferring 41-year-old veteran Francesco Antonioli to him. However, he did play a game in the Coppa Italia, with Cesena losing to Novara by 3 goals to 1.\n\nOn 29 December 2010, Cavalieri returned to Brazil, signing with Fluminense.[9] After securing his place in the starting XI during 2011, he was an essential part on Fluminense's title campaign in 2012 First Division, and his displays earned him his debut on national team and the Best Goalkeeper award in that year.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, Cavalieri was signed by Premier League club Crystal Palace on a short-term contract.[10] He was released by the club in June on expiry of his contract.[11]\n\nOn December 2018, Cavalieri signed a contract with Botafogo, becoming an immediate reserve for Paraguayan goalkeeper Gatito Fern\u00e1ndez. In the 2020\u201321 season Cavalieri took over the team's starting line-up after the injury to Gatito, Botafogo's main goalkeeper. At the end of the same season Cavalieri was injured and lost his starting position to Diego Loureiro. In September 2021, Botafogo announced the termination of Diego Cavalieri's contract.\n[12]\n\nOn 13 November 2012, Cavalieri was called up by Mano Menezes for the Brazil squad that will play Supercl\u00e1sico de las Am\u00e9ricas.[13] Playing 90 minutes, Cavalieri, in his debut, won the title.\n\nPalmeiras\n\nFluminense\n\nBrazil\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Cavalieri"}, {"id": 116, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/43/859102/original/dimitris-salpigidis-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Dimitris Salpingidis", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/dimitris-salpigidis/859102", "desc": "Dimitrios \"Dimitris\" Salpingidis (Greek: \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a3\u03b1\u03bb\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2; born 18 August 1981) is a former Greek professional footballer who played as a winger or striker.

He was known to be \"a very quick and useful tool on the counter attack.\"[2]\n\nBorn in Zagliveri, Salpingidis started out as a Greco-Roman wrestler before discovering his calling in football.[3] Salpingidis began his football career through the youth ranks of PAOK. Before football Salpingidis was participating in wrestling in which he was very good at, with a dream of competing in the Olympics. He didn't make it as a wrestler but his dream came true as footballer in 2004. On 30 September 1999 he marked his official debut against Lokomotivi Tbilisi with a goal in a 2\u20130 win. Acknowledging his potential and in order to gain much needed experience, the team soon loaned him for two successive seasons to Kavala where he finished top scorer of the Second Division. His plea for a return to PAOK was granted by his mentor, Angelos Anastasiadis and he became an integral part of the team. On 25 August 2002 he made his league debut for PAOK in a 4\u20131 win against Panathinaikos. He scored his first league goal in 2\u20133 away win against OFI.\n\nDespite playing out of position as a right midfielder he managed to earn a place in the starting line-up, just a few months after returning from loan. Plagued with financial problems, the next season saw the club experiencing an exodus of its top players such as striker Ioannis Okkas and ex-Newcastle United forward Giorgos Georgiadis, Salpingidis, at the age of 21, then became first-choice striker and captain of the team. The 2003\u201304 season proved to be the best in many years, as the club finished an unexpected 3rd, qualifying for the Champions league, despite running on a very low budget. His significance for PAOK was such that in the summer 2004 he was given permission to miss a match with the Greek Olympic team so that he could participate in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers against Maccabi Tel Aviv. The elimination at the hands of the Israeli team, followed by the sack of coach Anastasiadis and subsequent financial turmoil hit the team badly, resulting in his exodus less than 2 years later. In the 2005\u201306 season he was top-scorer in the league with 17 goals.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, as the club's president Giannis Goumenos was desperate to cash in, he was openly chased by Olympiacos, AEK Athens and Panathinaikos. Salpingidis publicly refused the offer of bitter rivals Olympiacos, despite being the most profiting one among the three. On 16 August, after a lengthy negotiation period, he finally agreed to sign a four-year contract to Panathinaikos. He transferred for a fee of \u20ac1.8 million, with PAOK additionally receiving Sandor Torghelle, Kostas Chalarambidis and Athanasios Tsigas as an exchange. This was the third most expensive transfer between Greek teams at that time, estimated at \u20ac5 million. This transfer caused heavy turmoil amid PAOK fans, branding Salpingidis a traitor and ungrateful to the pains they had taken to keep him in the club. This tense situation brought about the demise of Goumenos' troubled presidency soon after. His debut with the greens was on 20 August 2006 in an away win with 4\u20131 against Egaleo where he scored three goals.\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Salpingidis was a key player during the victorious march to the Greek championship.\n\nAfter four very successful seasons with Panathinaikos (including a double-winning 2009\u20132010 season), in the summer of 2010 Salpingidis joined PAOK once again. On 16 June 2010, it was officially announced that he signed a four-year contract with PAOK, after his contract with Panathinaikos had expired. This club means everything for him as he explained\u00a0: \"I first played for the club in the 1990s and I feel very good there. My whole family and my childhood friends live in the town and I'm playing football for a team with big ambitions. PAOK are one of a select group of clubs with the most fanatical supporters in Europe. Throughout the whole of the north of Greece, people live for the team alone and nothing else.\"[4]\n\nOn 9 January 2011, he scored his 100th goal in the Greek Superleague against Asteras Tripolis with a header. On 3 November 2011, Salpingidis became the Greek player with the most goals in Europe. On 30 November he scored a header, beating Heurelho Gomes, in a 2\u20131 win against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, after a cross from Giorgios Georgiadis, in the Europa League.[5][6]\n\nIn the start of the 2012\u201313 season he changed his squad number from 9 to his favourite 14. In July 2012, Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf are in the process of trying to sign Dimitris Salpingidis from PAOK.[7] The newly promoted Bundesliga side's general manager, Werner Wolf, claimed last week that there would be no more new arrivals at the Esprit Arena before the start of the 2012\u201313 campaign. However, Goal.com has learned that Fortuna are currently trying to agree a fee with PAOK for Salpingidis, who was one of the stars of Greece's surprise run to the quarter-finals of Euro 2012. The versatile attacker is on a net salary of \u20ac800,000 with his hometown club and Fortuna are not in a position to match those terms.[8] However, they are prepared to make Salpingidis one of their highest earners and it is believed that the player is willing to take a pay cut in order to at last try his luck in the Bundesliga, having been often linked with a move to Germany in recent seasons.[7]\n\nIn the late February and early March 2013 he was in superb form scoring 6 goals in 4 matches. On 17 March 2013 he put pen to paper on a 4-year deal to stay at the club until 2017, hoping to finish his career with his beloved team.[9]\nHe scored two scissor kicks on 23 February 2013 against Kerkyra in a 3\u20131 home win. On 20 March 2013 he assumed the team captaincy after Pablo Garcia left the club. For the first time in his career, he received a red card in an away match against Platanias in which PAOK won 1\u20132. On 17 April 2013 he went on to score the winning goal in a thrilling 2\u20131 victory over Asteras Tripoli in the first leg of the Greek Cup semi-finals.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, Salpingidis took the field in PAOK FC's final Group L game, at home to AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, making his 67th appearance in the UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League.[10] Not a particularly attractive number, but one that carries a certain significance for the 32-year-old forward since it will move him up to fourth place in the competition's all-time appearances list. Two more in the round of 32 would take him level with FC Internazionale Milano's two-time UEFA Cup-winning goalkeeper Walter Zenga in third. Moreover, a third group stage goal this season would lift him to seventh in the overall scorers rankings on 24 goals, alongside Mladen Petri\u0107 and Claudio Pizarro. The tournament has played a significant role in Salpingidis's career; his maiden goal for PAOK came on his first-team debut when he was introduced as a substitute for Zisis Vryzas \u2013 now PAOK's president \u2013 in a UEFA Cup game against FC Lokomotivi Tbilisi on 30 September 1999. Meanwhile, his 100th goal for the 'Two-Headed Eagle Of The North' arrived in PAOK's first meeting with AZ of the current campaign. Oddly enough, both landmark goals were scored under Dutch coaches: Arie Haan in 1999 and Huub Stevens in 2013.[3]\n\nOn 26 April 2014, Salpingidis unsuccessfully tried to win his second trophy with PAOK in the Greek Cup final against Panathinaikos. PAOK settled, though, and with half-time their forward forays began to carry real menace. Salpingidis had twice gone close to an equaliser, rattling the bar with a header, and, right before the interval, was millimetres away from turning in Miroslav Stoch's cross with the goal at his mercy. Eventually his club defeated by 1\u20134.[11]\n\nThe 2014\u201315 season did not start well for the Greek international. Dimitris Salpingidis has an additional year contract with the club, but there are a few problems appeared in the season and it seems that the final discussion will take place at the end of it.[12] On 29 May 2015, just before the Superleague Greece play-offs, the international striker made a special program due to the discomfort in his operated toe, but could not be ready to help his club in the remaining games. Salpingidis is added to the list of players who missed this season, having to play since mid-March. The 34-year-old striker was not in his best physical condition, but Giorgos Georgiadis, coach of PAOK hoped that he could be able to give some solutions, mainly because of his experience. Salpingidis will be ready to help his teammates from the beginning of next season.[13]\n\nOn 24 August 2015, the 34-year-old Salpingidis contract at PAOK was terminated.[14][15]\n\nSalpingidis has made 82 appearances and scored 13 times for the Greece national football team, including the winning goal in the away leg of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification play-offs against Ukraine, which sent Greece through to the final tournament.[16][17] He made his debut for the national team on 17 August 2005 against Belgium.\nOn 17 June 2010, in a 2010 FIFA World Cup group stage match against Nigeria, he scored Greece's first ever World Cup goal with a shot from outside the area deflected off in Lukman Haruna.[18]\nOn 8 June 2012, Salpingidis came on as a substitute and scored Greece's first goal in the Euro 2012 tournament, in the opening match, a 1\u20131 draw against Poland,[19] becoming the first ever Greek player who scored in both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro. \nLater in the quarterfinals against Germany, he assisted Giorgos Samaras' goal and also scored the last goal with a penalty against Manuel Neuer, a match that ended 4\u20132, resulting Germany proceeding to the semi-finals.[20]\n\nSalpingidis\u2019 next goal is to reach new international heights in Brazil three months from now, with Colombia, Japan and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire awaiting Greece as Group C opponents. \u201cOf course, my team-mates and I are already very excited,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait \u2013 it\u2019s the biggest and best tournament in the world, and it\u2019ll be a huge football party. Every child dreams of playing at a World Cup.\u201d The forward continued: \u201cI hope I can enjoy it. We were in South Africa four years ago and won the first World Cup match in our history there, but we went out after the group stage. This time, our aim is to reach the last 16. We\u2019re in a finely balanced group with no major favourites. It won\u2019t be easy, but we can do it.\u201d Yet Salpingidis, who with four goals from nine games was his country's second-highest scoring player in qualifying, does not want to hog the spotlight. \u201cI\u2019m nothing special in the team, just a part in the machine,\u201d he stressed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any huge stars; we\u2019re all the same and all have one target.\u201d[21]\n\nPAOK\n\nPanathinaikos\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitris_Salpingidis"}, {"id": 117, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/96/1912121/original/rio-ferdinand-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Rio Ferdinand", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/rio-ferdinand/1912121", "desc": "Rio Gavin Ferdinand (born 7 November 1978) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre back, and current television pundit for BT Sport.

He became a fan favourite, winning the Hammer of the Year award the following season. He earned his first senior international cap in a match against Cameroon in 1997, setting a record as the youngest defender to play for England at the time. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Leeds United and he transferred to the club for a record-breaking fee of \u00a318\u00a0million. He spent two seasons at the club, becoming the team captain in 2001, before he joined Manchester United in July 2002 for around \u00a330\u00a0million, breaking the transfer fee record once more.\n\nAt Manchester United, he won the Premier League, his first major club honour, in a successful first season at the club. In September 2003, he missed a drugs test and was banned from football for eight months from January until September 2004, causing him to miss half a Premier League season, Manchester United's FA Cup triumph, and the Euro 2004 international competition. Upon his return, he established himself in the Manchester United first team and received plaudits for his performances, featuring in the PFA Team of the Year four times in five years. More club success followed with another Premier League win in the 2006\u201307 season and a Premier League and UEFA Champions League double the following year. His career at United, in which he won six Premier League titles and 14 trophies,[8] ended when his contract expired in 2014, and he subsequently joined Queens Park Rangers where he played for just one season before being released from the club as a result of their relegation from the Premier League. He announced his retirement from professional football on 30 May 2015.\n\nIn September 2017, Ferdinand announced his intention to become a professional boxer, partly to help him cope with the death of his wife.[9] His brother, Anton, also a centre-back, last played for St Mirren. Former England international striker Les Ferdinand and former Dagenham & Redbridge midfielder Kane Ferdinand are his cousins.\n\nRio Gavin Ferdinand was born on 7 November 1978 at King's College Hospital in Camberwell and grew up in Peckham.[10] He is the son of an Irish mother, Janice Lavender, and an Afro-Saint Lucian father, Julian Ferdinand.[11][12]\n\nFerdinand grew up in Peckham in a large family, his mother was one of six children and his father arrived in Britain with ten other family members.[13] Both parents worked to support the family, his mother as a child carer and his father as a tailor. His parents never married and they separated when he was 14 years old. His father remained close, moving to a nearby estate, and took the kids to football training and to local parks.[11][14] Ferdinand attended Camelot Primary School.[14][15] At school, he focused on maths and revelled in the opportunity to perform before an audience during a school production of Bugsy Malone.[14]\n\n\"I always as a kid wanted to do something different, I'd get bored very easily\u00a0\u2013 even playing football or hanging around with my mates. So travelling away from home, meeting new people. ... I enjoyed it.\"[14]\nHe chose to attend Blackheath Bluecoat School to make new friends and settled in well, feeling his confidence growing.[11] His second year was marred by the death of a fellow pupil, Stephen Lawrence, and the event demonstrated the ever-present threat of violence.[15] Ferdinand enjoyed physical expression, taking part in not just football and gymnastics classes but drama, theatre and ballet too.[14] He was an able child: he represented Southwark in gymnastics at the London Youth Games,[16] by age 10 he had been invited to train at the Queens Park Rangers academy, and at age 11 he won a scholarship to attend the Central School of Ballet in London.[11] Ferdinand attended the ballet classes, travelling to the city centre four days a week for four years.[14]\n\nFerdinand's superior footballing abilities were evident even as a child: when he was 11 years old a youth coach, David Goodwin, remarked \"I'm going to call you Pel\u00e9, son, I like the way you play.\"[14] Ferdinand was regularly playing in youth teams and at Eltham Town he played as an attacking midfielder but team scouts saw the young player had the physical potential to be a centre-back instead. Teams vied for the young footballer's services and during his youth he trained with Charlton Athletic, Chelsea, Millwall and Queens Park Rangers. Ferdinand was ever curious of different places and even travelled north to Middlesbrough's training ground, spending a good part of his school holidays in a bedsit just to be there.[14]\n\nLondon team West Ham United was to be his footballing home, however, and he joined their youth system in 1992.[11] He signed his first Youth Training Scheme contract in January 1994 and played alongside players such as Frank Lampard at the academy.[14][17] Success pending at club level, international football also began for Ferdinand; at 16 he joined the England youth-team squad to compete in their age group's UEFA European Championship, gaining his first experience of international competition.[14]\n\nOriginally scouted by Frank Lampard, Ferdinand progressed through the youth-team ranks, earning a professional contract and a place in the first-team squad in the process.[14] On 5 May 1996, he made his senior team debut, as he came on as a substitute for Tony Cottee in the Hammers' last game of the season, a 1\u20131 home draw against Sheffield Wednesday.[14][18] During the summer of 1997, Manchester United made enquires about Ferdinand before they turned to Henning Berg after West Ham rejected any sale.[19]\n\nDuring the 1997\u201398 season, Ferdinand won the Hammer of the Year award at the young age of 19.[20]\n\nIn November 1996, Ferdinand joined AFC Bournemouth on loan. He made his debut on 9 November in a 1\u20131 away draw against Blackpool. He played 10 games for Bournemouth before returning to West Ham in January 1997.[21]\n\nFerdinand joined Premier League club Leeds United in November 2000 for \u00a318\u00a0million, then a British transfer record as well as becoming the world's most expensive defender.[20] Despite an uncomfortable start to his career at Elland Road, beginning with a 3\u20131 defeat at Leicester City on his debut,[22] Ferdinand settled well and became an integral part of the Leeds team that reached the semi-final stage of the UEFA Champions League, scoring with a header in the quarter-final against Spain's Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a.[23] Other highlights during his spell in Yorkshire included goals against Liverpool at Anfield[24] and a scoring return to Upton Park.[25]\n\nThe following season, in August 2001, he became the club captain after replacing Lucas Radebe and turned in an impressive second campaign, despite Leeds' failure to break into the top three and secure qualification for the competition they had figured in so prominently during the previous season. During the 2002 FIFA World Cup, rumours began circulating that the club were in dire financial trouble and that new manager Terry Venables would be forced to part with his star defender for a substantial amount of cash. Later that summer after Ferdinand's impressive World Cup for England, Leeds accepted a bid of \u00a329.3\u00a0million with possible performance related add-ons up to \u00a333.3\u00a0million due to their perilous financial position.[26] Years later, Rio admitted he sat in the office of Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale for almost six hours to force the transfer through.[27]\n\nOn 22 July 2002, Ferdinand joined fellow Premier League side Manchester United on a five-year deal to become the most expensive British footballer in history at the time and the world's most expensive defender for a second time, a title he had lost in 2001 to Lilian Thuram. Ferdinand went on to win the Premier League title with Manchester United in his first season at the club. He collected a winner's medal in the 2006 League Cup, with runners-up medals in the 2003 League Cup and the 2005 FA Cup.[28]\n\nIn September 2003, he failed to attend a drug test scheduled to take place at United's Carrington training ground.[29] Ferdinand had left after training to go shopping, only to remember and attempt to return, only to be told it was too late.[30] He later undertook the test and passed,[31] and also later offered to have a hair follicle test,[32] but the FA turned down the offer.[33] The Football Association (FA) Disciplinary Committee, chaired by Barry Bright, imposed an eight-month ban from January 2004 at club and international level and a \u00a350,000 fine, meaning he would miss the rest of the season and some of the next along with all of Euro 2004.[34] United appealed against the verdict and sought to draw parallels to the case of Manchester City player Christian Negouai, who was fined \u00a32,000 for missing a test.[35] In the end, the original verdict was upheld.[36] In September, it was announced that he would make his return against Liverpool;[37] Alex Ferguson praised his \"assuredness and composure\" as United won the match 2\u20131.[38]\n\nIn a fixture against Charlton Athletic in May 2005, United supporters booed Ferdinand amidst his refusal to sign a new contract.[39][40] Ferdinand still hadn't signed a new contract in July and faced pressure from Ferguson to sign it,[41] taking away his position as vice-captain.[42] Ferdinand was booed during several pre-season friendlies in July and August,[43][44] before finally signing a new four-year contract.[45] Ferdinand later reflected on the saga, saying how he used it as motivation to change the views of United's supporters from negative to positive.[46]\n\nOn 14 December, in a game against Wigan Athletic, Ferdinand scored his first goal for United, en route to a 4\u20130 victory.[47] He followed this later in the month with a powerfully headed goal against West Bromwich Albion.[48] On 22 January 2006, Ferdinand scored a last minute winner against Liverpool at Old Trafford.[49] In the corresponding fixture in the following season on 22 October, Ferdinand scored again in a 2\u20130 victory.[50]\n\nFollowing impressive and consistent performances in the league, Rio Ferdinand was named in the 2006\u201307 PFA Premiership Team of the Season, alongside seven of his Manchester United teammates.[51]\n\nFerdinand started the 2007\u201308 season well, he was part of a United defence that managed to keep six clean sheets in a row in the Premier League, before conceding an early goal to Aston Villa at Villa Park on 20 October 2007.[52] It was also during this game where Ferdinand scored his first goal of the season, which was United's third goal of that game, with a left foot strike which took a very strong deflection off one of Villa's defenders. Just three days later, Ferdinand scored his first European goal for United by opening the scoring against Dynamo Kyiv, with a superb header. United dominated the game and won 4\u20132.[53]\n\nOn 12 January 2008, Ferdinand bagged a rare Premier League goal in a 6\u20130 hammering of Newcastle United at Old Trafford. In their FA Cup quarter-final match against Portsmouth on 8 March 2008 when Manchester United dominated, Ferdinand made a rare appearance as a goalkeeper, after Edwin van der Sar left the pitch with a groin injury and the replacement keeper, Tomasz Kuszczak, was sent off after conceding a penalty. Despite diving the right way, he was unable to save Sulley Muntari's spot kick, and Manchester United were eliminated from the FA Cup.[54] On 6 April 2008, against Middlesbrough, Ferdinand limped out of the match due to a foot injury. He was rated doubtful whether he would face A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg on 9 April 2008. He would play the full 90 minutes, though he received three stitches at half-time.[55]\n\nAfter United's 2\u20131 loss to Chelsea in the Premier League in April 2008, Ferdinand swore at Chelsea stewards and tried to kick a wall in the tunnel, but instead kicked a female steward, Tracy Wray. Ferdinand claimed to have merely brushed her with his foot.[56] He said he had apologised and sent the steward some flowers. However, Wray showed the bruise on her leg to the media, and her husband claimed that Ferdinand had not apologised or sent flowers.[57]\n\nIt was announced on 18 April 2008 that, along with Michael Carrick and Wes Brown, Ferdinand had agreed to sign a new five-year contract, worth around \u00a3130,000 a week, that would keep him with United until 2013.[58] On 21 May 2008, Ferdinand captained Manchester United to a Champions League Final victory versus Chelsea.[59] He accepted the trophy together with Ryan Giggs, as Giggs was the on field captain for most of the matches during that season during Gary Neville's absence due to injury.\n\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live he criticised FIFA's approach to tackling racism in football, stating that not enough was being done to punish those guilty of homophobic or racist abuse at matches. Regarding taunts aimed at Emile Heskey in England's 4\u20131 victory against Croatia in Zagreb, Ferdinand remarked:\n\"Croatia were fined a few thousand quid. What's that going to do? That is not going to stop people shouting racist or homophobic abuse...If things like this keep happening you have to take points off them. Then the punters will realise the team is going to be punished.\"[60]\nFerdinand had an injury plagued 2009\u201310 season, a number of back and knee injuries kept him on the sidelines for months. He returned to action on 28 January 2010, but was banned for four games after being found guilty of violent conduct for elbowing Hull City's Craig Fagan.[61][62]\n\nDue to a knee injury he suffered in the summer of 2010, which ruled him out of the World Cup for England, he missed all of pre-season, the Community Shield and the first four games of the 2010\u201311 Premier League season. He returned to first-team football in the opening game of the Champions League group stage against Rangers on 14 September. He captained the side and played the full 90 minutes in a goalless draw. He started the season opening game in August 2011, the 2011 FA Community Shield, where United found themselves 2\u20130 down at half time to city rivals Manchester City. Ferdinand was taken off after 45 minutes along with defensive partner Nemanja Vidi\u0107 and replaced by Jonny Evans and Phil Jones respectively. United went on to win the game 3\u20132 and Ferdinand claimed his fourth Community Shield medal of his career. Ferdinand started in the opening Premier League match of the season at West Bromwich Albion, a game United won 2\u20131, but he went off with a hamstring injury after 75 minutes. After the match, Alex Ferguson confirmed that Ferdinand would be out for six weeks. Ferdinand however recovered much quicker than initially diagnosed and returned to take a place on the bench two weeks later at Old Trafford in United's 8\u20132 demolition of Arsenal, although he did not play a part in the game.[63] Ferdinand made his return to competitive action in a 1\u20131 draw against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.\n\nOn 9 December 2012, Ferdinand was struck and injured by a coin thrown from the home crowd during United's 3\u20132 derby victory away from home against Manchester City.[64]\n\nOn 5 March 2013, Ferdinand, unhappy with the referee C\u00fcneyt \u00c7ak\u0131r's decision to send off Nani during a 2\u20131 Champions League defeat to Real Madrid at Old Trafford, clapped sarcastically in the referee's face after the game. He escaped any punishment from UEFA for the incident.[65]\n\nOn 12 May 2013, Ferdinand scored the winner and final goal of the Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford in a 2\u20131 victory over Swansea City. After a corner was missed by everyone, the ball found its way to Ferdinand at the back post and he hit it on the volley to seal the win. On 23 May 2013, it was announced that Ferdinand had secured a new one-year contract that would see him stay with the club until the end of the 2013\u201314 season.[66] He was not offered an extension when that contract expired, and agreed to leave Manchester United on 12 May 2014. In a letter on his official website, he said \"I am feeling fit and healthy, ready for a new challenge and looking forward to whatever the future holds for me.\"[67]\n\nOn 17 July 2014, Ferdinand signed for newly promoted Premier League club Queens Park Rangers on a one-year contract.[68] He returned to Old Trafford for the first time since leaving Manchester United on 14 September 2014 to face his former club in the Premier League in which his side was beaten 4\u20130.[69]\n\nIn October 2014, Ferdinand confirmed in an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show that he would retire at the end of the season, saying \"I'm not fearful of retirement, I'm looking forward to it, I can see some good stuff hopefully happening ahead\".[70] In May 2015, following their relegation, Queens Park Rangers announced the release of Ferdinand in the summer.[71] He made only 12 appearances for QPR in his only season with the club.[72]\n\nOn 30 May 2015, Ferdinand announced his retirement from professional football, three days after his departure from QPR.[73][74]\n\nFerdinand was capped 81 times for England, making him England's second most capped black player behind Ashley Cole with 107.[75] Although Ferdinand was named in four consecutive England World Cup squads (albeit without playing in 1998 and missing 2010 through injury), he never went to a European Championship due to a ban for missing a drugs test and due to England's failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008.\n\nFerdinand scored three goals for England,[76] the first in the 2002 World Cup second round match against Denmark (although some sources credit this goal as a Thomas S\u00f8rensen own goal).[77] The second was a near-post strike that beat the Russian goalkeeper Vyacheslav Malafeev in England's Euro 2008 qualifier against Russia on 12 September 2007 at Wembley Stadium. The third on 11 October 2008 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at home to Kazakhstan. England won 5\u20131.[78]\n\nAt the age of 19 years and 8 days, Ferdinand earned his first full England cap as a substitute in a friendly against Cameroon on 15 November 1997, making him the youngest defender to play for England at the time (a record broken in 2006 by Micah Richards). Ferdinand would have made an even earlier debut in September had he not been charged with drink-driving in the build-up to England's 1998 World Cup qualifier against Moldova. Ferdinand was named in the squad for this game and was a likely starter; however, the public mourning for Princess Diana\u00a0\u2013 whose chauffeur had been suspected of drink-driving\u00a0\u2013 left Glenn Hoddle with little choice but to drop the teenager from the squad.[79] After an impressive 1997\u201398 season he was selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup squad as a back-up defender. However, he was not selected in Kevin Keegan's 22-man squad for UEFA Euro 2000.[80][81]\n\nAfter his \u00a318\u00a0million move to Leeds United, Ferdinand was named in the starting line-up by caretaker manager Peter Taylor in a friendly match against Italy[82] and quickly established himself as a first-choice player under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. He was selected as one of England's two first-choice centre-backs at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, wearing the number 5 shirt.\n\nJohn Terry (with whom Ferdinand would later partner in central defence) replaced Ferdinand in the England side throughout his eight-month ban until his return on 9 October 2004 in their World Cup qualifier against Wales. Ferdinand played ten World Cup finals matches for England, recording clean sheets against Argentina, Nigeria and Denmark in 2002, and Paraguay, Trinidad & Tobago, Ecuador and Portugal in 2006.[83]\n\nOn 25 March 2008, it was announced that Ferdinand would wear the captain's armband for Fabio Capello's second game in charge of the national team,[84] ahead of John Terry, Steven Gerrard or David Beckham, who some believed would be named captain to mark his 100th cap for his country. An FA statement suggested that the decision to name Ferdinand as captain was part of Capello's plans of rotating the captaincy before naming an official captain for September's World Cup qualifiers. On 19 August, however, Ferdinand lost out to Terry in retaining the captain's armband but was named vice-captain by Fabio Capello.[85]\n\nA mistake in the match between England and Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk on 10 October 2009, which led to the sending off of Robert Green, caused some to question his inclusion in the squad. A lack of match practice for his club and a series of errors such as he suffered in his early days as a footballer led to criticism of his inclusion from several corners.[86]\n\nOn 5 February 2010, Ferdinand replaced John Terry as captain of England.[87]\n\nAlthough back and groin injury problems forced him to miss much of the 2009\u201310 domestic season, Ferdinand was selected to captain England at the 2010 World Cup. However, he suffered a knee ligament injury during the team's first training session in South Africa on 4 June and was subsequently ruled out of the tournament.[88] On 19 March 2011, ahead of England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Wales, Capello announced that John Terry was to be re-instated as permanent England captain and that Ferdinand would return to his role of vice-captain.[89]\n\nFerdinand was left out of Roy Hodgson's squad for Euro 2012, leading to strong speculation this was to avoid potential conflict with John Terry, who was included in the squad, due to Terry's upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother Anton.[90] Further controversy arose after Gary Cahill was ruled out of the tournament, with 22-year-old Martin Kelly with only two minutes of international football being called up as a replacement instead of Ferdinand. This led to Ferdinand's representative Jamie Moralee accusing Hodgson of showing a \"lack of respect\".[91]\n\nOn 3 October 2012, the Daily Mirror reported that Roy Hodgson had revealed to fellow passengers on the London Underground that Ferdinand would no longer be considered for England duty, despite the retirement of John Terry.[92] Hodgson later apologised for these comments and denied that he was ruling Ferdinand out of playing for England again.[93]\n\nOn 14 March 2013, Ferdinand was recalled to the England squad for the first time under Hodgson for England's 2014 World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Montenegro, though subsequently Ferdinand pulled out of the squad on 18 March due to 'fitness concerns'. Ferdinand said he was \"gutted\" at having to withdraw but said it was the \"right decision\". However, Roy Hodgson assured Ferdinand he still had an international future despite the withdrawal.[94][95]\n\nIn May 2013, Ferdinand announced his retirement from international football, saying that \"it's the right time to make room for young players and focus on the club career\".[96][97]\n\nFerdinand was considered an atypical defensive product of English football due to his more elegant, graceful, and \"continental\" rather than physical style of defensive play;[98][99][100][101] in particular, he was singled out for his unique technical ability, skill, balance, and confidence on the ball, despite his height, as well as his composure in possession, distribution with either foot, and his ability to carry the ball forward or play it out from the back on the ground.[102][103][104][105][106][107] As such, due to his mobility and ball\u2013playing ability, he was often paired with a more physical centre-back throughout his career, such as Nemanja Vidi\u0107 with Manchester United, or John Terry with England.[105][106][108][109] Although he often played in a central defensive pairing in a back\u2013four throughout his career, he was also capable of playing in the centre of a three\u2013man back\u2013line, in which he essentially functioned as a sweeper, courtesy of his technique and passing.[110] Due to his ball skills, he occasionally drew criticism from pundits and his managers in his youth for taking unnecessary risks in possession, and committing mistakes, although he improved upon this aspect of the game as he matured with age and experience.[101][111]\n\nA world-class defender, who was considered to be one of the best stoppers in the world at his peak,[99][112] Ferdinand is regarded as one of the best defenders of his generation, and as one of England's, Manchester United's, and the Premier League's best ever centre-backs.[98][103][109][113][114][115] In his prime, he was also praised for his pace, work-rate, and tackling,[101][104][105] in addition to his positioning, consistency, intelligence, and ability to read the game.[98][116][117][118][119][120] He was also an athletic and physically strong defender, who was reliable in the air,[98][121][122][123] although at times he was criticised in the media for his aerial game, as well as his ability to defend high balls and set pieces, in particular in his youth.[111][124] In addition to his defensive skills, he also possessed significant leadership qualities.[104][125] Despite his ability, however, his later career was marked by injuries, which led him to lose the exceptional pace which had characterised him in his early career, and which previously allowed him to compensate for the occasional lapses in concentration he experienced in his youth; as such, he occasionally struggled against faster opponents with his advancing age.[99][110][115][123]\n\nIn September 2017, Ferdinand announced that he was launching a career to become a professional boxer. His move into the ring was sponsored by betting company Betfair, who assisted him in attempting to qualify for his British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) licence before he began training and competing. Ferdinand stated that \"I'm doing this [boxing] because it's a challenge, I've won titles and now I'm aiming for a belt.\"[126] It was announced in May 2018 that Ferdinand had been refused a professional boxing licence by the British Boxing Board of Control. BBBofC general secretary Robert Smith told BBC Sport.\"There are a lot of things we take into consideration. He never had a competitive fight and although he has been in the gym, there is a difference between being in the gym and boxing. We do not deem it beneficial for him to have a licence.\"[127] Following the rejection, Ferdinand announced that he was \"hanging-up his gloves\".[128]\n\nOn 20 October 2013, Ferdinand and Roy Hodgson were appointed to the Football Association's commission to improve the state of the national game.[129]\n\nFerdinand grew up in the Friary council estate, Peckham.[15] He has several brothers and sisters: one brother and three sisters on his father's side and a brother and sister from his mother's remarriage.[11] His brother, Anton Ferdinand, also played as a defender, while his cousins are Les Ferdinand and Kane Ferdinand.[15] Although he spent the majority of his career with Manchester United, he grew up supporting rivals Liverpool.[130]\n\nIn 2006 in Manchester, Ferdinand's girlfriend Rebecca Ellison gave birth to their first son.[131] The couple had two more children.[132] In 2010, Ferdinand unsuccessfully sued the Sunday Mirror to prevent the publication of a story about an alleged affair with Carly Storey.[133] During the case, it was alleged that then-England captain Ferdinand had affairs with 10 different women.[134][135]\n\nEllison and Ferdinand married in 2009. Ellison died of breast cancer on 2 May 2015, aged 34.[136][137] Ferdinand's memoir of his wife's illness and subsequent bereavement, Thinking Out Loud, was co-written with Decca Aitkenhead, and published in October 2017.[138]\n\nOn 27 September 2019, Ferdinand married for the second time, to Kate Wright. The ceremony was attended by his children, along with the couple's other close family members.[139] In June 2020, Ferdinand and Wright announced that they were expecting their first child together,[140] the child, a boy, was born on 18 December 2020.\n\nFerdinand set up the Live the Dream Foundation charity in December 2009 to provide education and employment opportunities for children.[141]\n\nAlthough Ferdinand has never voted before in a general election, he backed a Remain vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.[142]\n\nIn 2000, Ferdinand briefly appeared in a sexually explicit video filmed at the Ayia Napa resort in Cyprus along with fellow English footballers Kieron Dyer and Frank Lampard. Channel 4 aired a brief clip as part of their 2004 documentary Sex, Footballers and Videotape, claiming it was used to \"remind the viewer that this is based on real life\".[143]\n\nIn 2002, during the rape trial of their acquaintance Martin King, Ferdinand and former Leeds colleague Michael Duberry denied allegations that Duberry had molested the woman and Ferdinand had threatened her in the Leeds nightclub Hi-Fi on the night of 22 January, as well as further allegations of scuffling and drunkenness. Both men were interviewed by the police but the Crown Prosecution Service announced in April 2003 that they would not face charges.[144] King was found guilty of indecent assault and attempted rape.[145]\n\nDuring a radio interview on The Chris Moyles Show in October 2006, Ferdinand attracted two listener complaints and criticism from gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell when he called Moyles a faggot, followed by \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm not homophobic\", after Moyles had jokingly suggested he was homosexual. BBC Radio 1 later dismissed the exchange as banter, while Tatchell said \"since [he] very promptly apologised, I am happy to accept his regret and leave it at that\".[146]\n\nIn the wake of a court case involving John Terry and Rio's brother Anton, in which Terry was found not guilty of racial abuse, Rio Ferdinand sparked media controversy by expressing amusement at the comments of a Twitter user who referred to Ashley Cole, who had testified in Terry's favour, as a \"choc ice\", a slang term which is commonly understood to mean \"black on the outside, white on the inside\". Ferdinand deleted the tweet shortly afterwards and denied choc ice is a racist term, adding, \"And if I want to laugh at something someone tweets....I will! Hahahahaha! Now stop getting ya knickers in a twist!\"[147] Cole's lawyers released a statement in response, stating that he would not be taking the matter further.[148] Ferdinand's words were condemned as \"insensitive and untimely\" by Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chief Clarke Carlisle.[149] In August 2012, Ferdinand was fined \u00a345,000 for his Twitter remarks after an Independent Regulatory Commission found him guilty of bringing the game into disrepute with an \"improper\" comment which included \"a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race.\"[150]\n\nIn October 2014, Ferdinand was again charged by the FA for using offensive language on Twitter, after referring to the mother of a critic as a \"sket\", a Jamaican slang word for a promiscuous female.[151] Ferdinand was fined \u00a325,000 for the offence and banned from playing for three games.[152] The FA considered Ferdinand's position as a \"role model\" to be an aggravating factor for the penalty, in addition to it being his second Twitter offence within three years and no admission of wrongdoing.[153]\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that Ferdinand would be the new face of online casino Casino Floor. The announcement provoked strong criticism on Twitter from a number of Ferdinand's followers,[154] who suggested it was inappropriate that a role model for young people should endorse gambling particularly given the well documented struggles of many of his peers with problem gambling.[155]\n\nIn September 1997, Ferdinand was convicted of drink-driving and given a one-year driving ban. He had been breathalysed after driving on the morning after a night out, and was found to be one point over the limit.[156] As a result, England manager Glenn Hoddle dropped Ferdinand from the squad to face Moldova in a World Cup qualification match on 10 September, meaning Ferdinand lost out on the chance, at 18 years and 10 months of age, of becoming the youngest England international since Duncan Edwards.[156][157]\n\nIn March 2003, Ferdinand was given another six-month ban from driving, and fined \u00a32,500 and six penalty points for driving at an average of 92\u00a0mph (148\u00a0km/h) along the M1.[158] In May 2005, he was criticised by a magistrate as he received his fourth ban from driving and a fine of \u00a31,500, after being caught by traffic police \"travelling at an average of 105.9\u00a0mph (170.4\u00a0km/h) over a distance of nearly two miles\" on the M6 motorway. Upon setting the penalty, the magistrate said Ferdinand \"should be a positive role model for young people in society and this does not give out the right message\". It followed two previous bans for speeding, in 2002 and 2003.[159]\n\nIn August 2020, Ferdinand was banned from driving for six months after he admitted speeding on the A27 at Hangleton in Hove. Ferdinand was reported to have driven at 85\u00a0mph. He was ordered to pay a total of \u00a3822 in fines and costs.[160]\n\nHe was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to association football and charity,[161] having set up the Rio Ferdinand Foundation in 2022, a charity which works with young people and aids community development.[162]\n\nThe Duran Duran song \"Rio\" has been used in football chants both for and against Ferdinand; in 2002, fan Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran's lead singer) promised to re-record one of the football chants if the England team (featuring Ferdinand) won their World Cup quarter-final against Brazil.[163]\n\nFerdinand was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a \"Secret Tournament\" commercial (branded \"Scorpion KO\") directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Lu\u00eds Figo, Fabio Cannavaro, and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \"referee\".[164][165]\n\nIn 2005, Ferdinand, along with an old school friend, created the record label White Chalk Music.[166] To date, there are two artists signed to the label: Melody Johnston and Nia Jai. The latter released an album on 6 October 2010, which features Ferdinand rapping.[167]\n\nIn June 2006, ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ferdinand presented the TV show Rio's World Cup Wind-Ups, in which he carried out a series of practical jokes on his England teammates. It was broadcast immediately after England's opening World Cup game against Paraguay.[168]\n\nHe made his first foray into the world of cinema in late 2008, financing and becoming an executive producer of Alex de Rakoff's film Dead Man Running. The film features Danny Dyer and 50 Cent in a gangster-themed plot. Ferdinand will share production credits with England teammate Ashley Cole.[169]\n\nIn 2008, Ferdinand filmed a documentary about Peckham, aiming to persuade youngsters away from a life of crime.[170]\n\nOn 16 January 2009, it was announced that he would working with publishing company Made Up Media to launch a digital magazine.[171] In conjunction with this, Ferdinand was guest editor of the February edition of the Observer Sport Monthly, providing interviews with people ranging from Gordon Brown to Usain Bolt.[172] The magazine, called \"#5 Magazine\", had its first issue published in April of that year.[173]\n\nIn 2015, he joined BT Sport as a pundit for their coverage of the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[174]\n\nIn March 2017, Ferdinand discussed strategies for coping with bereavement in the BBC One documentary Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad.[175] The programme won the Robert Flaherty Award for Single Documentary at the 2018 BAFTA Awards.\n\nWest Ham United\n\nManchester United[197][8]\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand"}, {"id": 118, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/585/11688413/original/stefano-borgonovo-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Stefano Borgonovo", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/stefano-borgonovo/11688413", "desc": "Stefano Borgonovo (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8ste\u02d0fano \u02ccbor\u0261o\u02c8n\u0254\u02d0vo]; 17 March 1964 \u2013 27 June 2013) was an Italian footballer and manager, who played as a striker.

An opportunistic striker, Borgonovo played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, and came to prominence while playing alongside Roberto Baggio with Fiorentina during the 1988\u201389 season, on loan from Milan. His prolific performances with Fiorentina earned him a permanent move to Milan, where he contributed to the club's European Cup victory in 1990, despite struggling with injuries.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Borgonovo served as a youth coach with Como; after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, he started the Fondazione Stefano Borgonovo to raise funds and awareness of the disease. Until his death as a result of the illness in June 2013, he was also extremely active off the pitch in the fight against doping in football.\n\nBorn in Giussano, Province of Monza and Brianza, Borgonovo began his professional career with Como Calcio, making his debut at 17 in a Serie A match against Ascoli Calcio, and reaching the semi-final of the 1985\u201386 Coppa Italia with the club. After a loan spell at S.S. Sambenedettese Calcio he established himself as a key player, and in 1986 moved to A.C. Milan, who immediately loaned him back to Como.[1]\n\nAfter two years Borgonovo was sent on loan again, this time to ACF Fiorentina, where he had the most successful season of his career, scoring 14 league goals in 30 appearances while playing alongside attacking partner Roberto Baggio under coach Sergio Santarini. The two forwards would form an important friendship, and their prolific goalscoring exploits that season (together they scored 29 of Fiorentina's 44 Serie A goals that season) would earn the attacking pair the nickname \"B2\", as both their surnames began with the letter B; together, they helped Fiorentina to qualify for the UEFA Cup.[2] One of his most memorable performances with Fiorentina came in a 4\u20133 win over Giovanni Trapattoni's Inter Milan side on 12 February 1989, in the last match of the first round; Inter were in first place, and were unbeaten in the league at the time. With Fiorentina trailing 3\u20132, Borgonovo first scored a goal to tie the match, and subsequently also netted the match-winner in the 85th minute, after hiding behind Inter defender Riccardo Ferri, and suddenly running to intercept Giuseppe Bergomi's back-pass, who later admitted that he was not aware of Borgonovo's position; Borgonovo subsequently anticipated Inter goalkeeper Walter Zenga's run and took it past him before putting the ball into the empty net to win the match. Inter went on to win the next eight matches and eventually won the Serie A title that season, setting a new record for most points in a single Serie A season; the team went on a second unbeaten streak, which was interrupted by a defeat to Torino in the penultimate match of the season.[3][4]\n\nBorgonovo's performances earned him three caps for Italy, all in 1989 \u2013 his debut coming on 22 February 1989, in a friendly with Denmark, which ended in a 1\u20130 victory to the Italians.[1] He also helped the under-21 side to qualify for the upcoming European Championships during the 1985\u201386 season, earning three caps, and scoring a crucial goal against Sweden, although he was unable to take part in the finals, in which Italy finished runners-up to Spain, due to injury.[2][5]\n\nBorgonovo's prolific season with Fiorentina also earned the chance to prove himself with the defending European Cup champions Milan in 1989. He spent much of the 1989\u201390 campaign as backup to Marco van Basten, also due to injury,[6] only making 13 appearances, and scoring 2 goals,[7] although he helped Milan to capture the European Supercup, the Intercontinental Cup, and most notably, the European Cup that season, first winning a penalty for Van Basten, and then scoring a crucial goal himself in the semi-finals, against Bayern M\u00fcnich; he scored 2 goals in total in the competition.[2][6][8] Despite earning a prestigious European Cup winners' medal, he left the club at the end of the season, keen to play regular first-team football; although Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi was keen to keep his services, he returned to Fiorentina, where he spent two years without managing to recapture his previous form.[7]\n\nSpells at Pescara Calcio, Udinese and Brescia Calcio followed, before Borgonovo retired in 1996. He later served as a youth coach back at Como, but retired in 2005 due to poor health.[7]\n\nA quick, agile, opportunistic, and intelligent striker, with an eye for goal, Borgonovo possessed an excellent positional sense in the area, as well as good acceleration, and fast reactions; these attributes allowed him to anticipate opponents in the area, and enabled him to be prolific in front of goal throughout his career, despite his relatively small stature, slender physique, and lack of notable pace. He was also a creative player with good mobility, link-up play, and technique, who was capable of playing off his team-mates.[3][8][9]\n\nBorgonovo married Chantal, and the couple had four children.[7] On 5 September 2008, it was revealed he was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[10]\n\nTo raise funds and awareness of the disease, Borgonovo started his own foundation[2] and a testimonial match was organized by his former clubs Fiorentina and Milan. The game, played on 8 October 2008 at Stadio Artemio Franchi, Florence in front of a crowd of 30,000 people, was attended by several former stars of the two clubs \u2013 he himself attended despite his serious condition, with former teammate Baggio at his side.[11]\n\nIn his 2010 autobiography Carlo Ancelotti: The Beautiful Games of an Ordinary Genius: The Life, Games, and Miracles of an Ordinary Genius[12] Napoli manager, Carlo Ancelotti, spoke of his former team-mate's illness, saying: 'Stefano was my team-mate, and he has a problem. We need everyone to help him because maybe there is a solution for this illness, but we have to be fast because his condition is not good. He cannot move, he can just speak with his eyes. He scored in the semi-final of the European Cup in 1990 against Bayern, and was a good striker inside the box. He was not so quick but very clever. He is a good guy, very funny, likes to joke, even now, but he has a very dangerous illness.'[8]\n\nBorgonovo wrote an autobiography, Attaccante nato (Born striker), while only to be able to make use of his eyes to control a computer to write it.[13] In the book, amongst other things, he talked about his stance against drugs, saying: 'My carcass is clean and always has been. The Bitch (his name for his condition) may have moved in, but it's not tainted with rust and it's never been doped. There's a shadow hanging over my photograph, but it was invented by others, ruthless hypocrites. They used to weigh up the symptoms and then kept on whispering: Borgonovo's on drugs, you know.'[14]\n\nIn 2013, Borgonovo joined FIFA's anti-doping fight.[15] He died from the disease on 27 June of that year, aged 49.[16] His death coincided with the Italian national team's semifinal against Spain at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the Italy squad wore black armbands as a mark of respect.[17]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Borgonovo"}, {"id": 119, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/24/473254/original/anthony-stokes-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Anthony Stokes", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/anthony-stokes/473254", "desc": "Anthony Stokes (born 25 July 1988) is an Irish professional footballer who plays for Turkish club Adana Demirspor as a striker.

He moved back to Scottish football when Hibernian signed him for \u00a3500,000 in August 2009, and he scored over 20 goals in his only full season there.[6] Stokes then moved to boyhood heroes Celtic for a fee of around \u00a31.2 million.[7] He played regularly for Celtic under the management of Neil Lennon and enjoyed success, but fell out of favour under Ronny Deila. In the latter part of the 2015\u201316 season he was loaned to Hibernian, who he helped win the 2015\u201316 Scottish Cup.\n\nAfter a season with Blackburn Rovers, Stokes joined Hibernian for a third time in 2017 but was released in 2018. He then had short spells with Greek club Apollon Smyrni, \nIranian clubs Tractor and Persepolis, and Turkish club Adana Demirspor, before returning to Scotland with Livingston in 2020. Stokes played in nine full internationals for the Republic of Ireland between 2007 and 2014.\n\nBorn in Dublin, County Dublin,[2] Stokes broke into the Arsenal reserve team at 15 years old.[8] He made his first-team debut as a substitute in a League Cup tie against Sunderland on 25 October 2005, coming on for Arturo Lupoli in the 88th minute of a 3\u20130 win. He trained with Sunderland with a view to a loan move in July 2006, but Sunderland manager Niall Quinn decided against it due to Sunderland's large squad depth and lack of a reserve team.[9]\n\nArsenal agreed a loan deal with Falkirk that saw Stokes play for the Scottish Premier League (SPL) side until the end of 2006.[10] Stokes scored his first goal for Falkirk in a 1\u20130 victory at Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 19 September 2006 in the Scottish League Cup.[11] He followed that up on 21 October with two more goals against Inverness.[12] On 28 October, he scored his first competitive hat-trick during Falkirk's 5\u20131 victory over Dundee United.[13] Stokes then scored another hat-trick in the following match against Dunfermline Athletic, which meant that he had scored nine goals in just four games.[14] Having become the first player to score hat-tricks in successive SPL games,[4] Stokes then hit a third in what proved to be his last game for Falkirk, a 3\u20131 home victory over Inverness on 30 December.[15]\n\nOn 7 November, Stokes scored an equaliser for Falkirk in extra time in a League Cup match against Celtic,[16] Falkirk going through 5\u20134 on penalties. His continuing good form saw him named Young Player of the Month for October and November.[17] By the end of his loan spell, Stokes had scored 16 goals in 18 league and cup appearances.[4]\n\nStokes was transferred by Arsenal to Sunderland for \u00a32 million in January 2007.[4][5] Celtic and Charlton Athletic had also been interested in the player, but Stokes revealed that he was greatly influenced by Sunderland manager and former Irish international, Roy Keane, in making his ultimate decision.[4][5][18] Stokes was originally handed the 26 shirt at Sunderland, but after the departure of Jon Stead to Sheffield United he was given the number 9 shirt. Stokes made his Sunderland debut a few days later, and crossed to set up David Connolly to give Sunderland a one-goal win over Ipswich.[19] Stokes scored his first goal for Sunderland on 10 February 2007 against Plymouth Argyle, scoring from 20 yards after coming on as a substitute.[20]\n\nStokes was barred from The Glass Spider club in Sunderland after Keane blamed it for distracting Stokes from his training.[21] The club owner offered to revoke the ban after the 2007\u201308 season and to give Stokes a complimentary bottle of champagne.[21] Stokes then scored his first Premier League goal; a last-minute winner against Derby County that took Sunderland out of the relegation zone.[22] Before the start of the 2008\u201309 season Stokes lost the Sunderland number 9 shirt and was handed the squad number 44 instead.[23] On 23 September 2008, Stokes scored two late goals to level a League Cup tie against Northampton Town.[24]\n\nOn 17 October 2008, Stokes agreed a three-month loan deal to Sheffield United, with the possibility of extending it for the season.[25] Stokes again took the shirt that was previously vacated by Jon Stead, this time number 8. Stokes made his debut for the Blades in the local derby against Sheffield Wednesday a few days later, coming on as a second-half substitute.[26] Stokes started his time at Bramall Lane as a first team regular but was soon dropped to the bench and returned to Sunderland having made 12 appearances but failed to score a goal.[27]\n\nIn March 2009, Stokes joined Crystal Palace on loan, scoring from a solo effort after his first start against Preston North End.[28] This was his only goal for Palace, however, and he returned to Sunderland at the end of the loan spell.\n\nStokes joined Hibernian for an undisclosed fee, reported by the Newcastle Evening Chronicle to be around \u00a3500,000, in August 2009.[29] This meant that he linked up again with John Hughes, who had been his manager during his loan spell at Falkirk.[29] Stokes made his Hibs debut against his former club Falkirk, and then credited Hughes as the main reason he decided to sign for Hibs.[30] He scored his first goals for Hibs in a 3\u20130 win at home to St Johnstone on 19 September.[31] At the same time, Stokes made newspaper headlines for a nightclub altercation, which prompted John Hughes to discipline him and to say that he felt \"let down\" by Stokes.[32] In December, however, Stokes scored five goals in three games, which helped to extend Hibs' unbeaten run in the SPL to 12 games.[33] On 27 December 2009, Stokes scored the fastest goal in Scottish Premier League history, after just 12.4 seconds against Rangers.[34] It broke the previous record of 17 seconds set by Saulius Mikoli\u016bnas in a match between Hearts and St Mirren on 2 December 2006.[35] Stokes' goal was the only highlight for Hibs, however, as they lost 4\u20131 to the league leaders. His good run of form was rewarded with the SPL young player of the month award for December 2009.[36] Stokes continued to score on a prolific basis throughout the 2009\u201310 season, although John Hughes expressed a desire to improve his all-round game.[37] Stokes won the goal of the season award from the SPL for a goal against Rangers in November 2009.[38]\n\nAt the start of the following season, Stokes acknowledged the need to improve other aspects of his play.[39] He was then linked with a move to Celtic, with their manager Neil Lennon commenting that Stokes was \"a player we like\".[40] The Scotsman reported that Hibs rejected an initial offer from Celtic,[41] but Hibs then accepted a second offer a few days later.[42]\n\nOn 31 August 2010, Stokes signed a four-year contract with Celtic.[43] Stokes made his Celtic debut on 11 September 2010, in a 3\u20130 win against Hearts.[44] He scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance on 19 September, the winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory against Kilmarnock.[45] Stokes scored a brace in a League Cup tie, against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in a 6\u20130 win[46] and another double in the quarter final against St Johnstone in a 3\u20132 win.[47] On 6 November, Stokes recorded his first hat-trick for Celtic in an SPL record 9\u20130 victory over Aberdeen.[48] After scoring a hat-trick, Stokes says he dedicated the goal to Celtic legend Henrik Larsson.[49] Another former Celtic striker, Chris Sutton, highlighted the successful link up play between Stokes and teammate Gary Hooper, stating \"Their link-up play is good and in that respect having both of these guys in the side is a huge positive for Celtic and it is encouraging.\"[50]\n\nAfter scoring a 90th-minute penalty in 1\u20131 draw at New Douglas Park with Hamilton on 12 January 2011,[51] Stokes entered a rich vein of form, scoring another penalty and an over-the-shoulder volley in a 3\u20130 win at Easter Road against Hibernian three days later.[52] He rounded the goalkeeper and scored the winner in a 1\u20130 home win against Aberdeen the following week.[53] He scored from a free-kick and a tap-in from a good refereeing advantage in a 4\u20130 home thrashing of Hearts on 26 January[54] and kept his cool from the spot and scored another penalty in a 4\u20131 win at Hampden Park in the semi-final of the League Cup against Aberdeen.[55]\n\nOn 24 July 2011, Stokes scored in Celtic's first match of the 2011\u201312 season, a 2\u20130 win over Hibernian.[56] On 15 October, Stokes scored twice in six minutes to help Celtic get a 3\u20133 draw against Kilmarnock. Celtic had been 3\u20130 down at half-time and Stokes' two goals, one a long-range shot and one a free-kick, were vital in bringing them back into he game.[57] Manager Neil Lennon later admitted that if Celtic had lost that match he might have had to resign. The comeback was also credited by assistant Johan Mj\u00e4llby as being the turning point in Celtic's season as they went from being 15-point behind Rangers to winning the league.[58] On 3 November, Stokes scored a brace in Celtic's 3\u20131 win over Stade Rennes in the group stages of the Europa League.[59] He then scored, and got an assist, in Celtic's next game, a 2\u20131 win over Motherwell.[60]\n\nOn 9 January, he scored a hat-trick in Celtic's 3\u20130 win over Third Division side Peterhead in the Fourth round of the League Cup.[61] Before the League Cup final, Stokes said how he felt he was unlikely to start the match. Despite having a very good scoring record with 20 goals for the season,[62] Stokes did not start and came on as a substitute with Celtic trailing 1\u20130. He went down in the box after a challenge late in the match. However, referee Willie Collum booked him for diving. After the match both Lennon and captain Scott Brown were critical of the referee, saying that decision cost Celtic the trophy and that it was a clear penalty.[63] After Celtic's 2\u20131 defeat to Hearts in the 2011\u201312 Scottish Cup semi-final, Stokes was given a one-match ban for the competition following an \"A5\" incident at the end of the match.[64] This was \"offensive, insulting and/or abusive language and/or gestures.[64] On 3 May, Stokes scored the only goal as Celtic beat St Johnstone 1\u20130.[65]\n\nStokes made his first appearance of the 2012\u201313 season as a substitute in the Champions League qualifier against HJK Helsinki. Stokes then started the next game against Aberdeen.  Stokes then picked up an injury which kept him out of action for five months until January 2013,[66] when he returned as a sub in a league game against Dundee United.[67] In December 2012, Stokes was disciplined by Celtic after he had attended a benefit event for Alan Ryan, a deceased member of the Real Irish Republican Army.[68] Stokes scored his first goal of the 2012\u201313 season against Kilmarnock on 30 January,[66][67] and scored twice against Dundee United two weeks later.[66][67] Stokes provided both assists for Gary Hooper's two goals in the first half of the 2013 Scottish Cup Final, against former club Hibs. He also received the man-of-the-match award as Celtic ran out 3\u20130 winners.[69]\n\nStokes scored his 50th goal for Celtic with a late free kick to beat Dundee United on 31 August 2013; Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara complained afterwards that Stokes had moved the ball back from its correct position to make it easier for him to strike it over the wall.[70] He signed a new three-year contract with Celtic in October.[71] On 5 January 2014, Stokes passed another milestone when he scored his 100th competitive career goal, scoring Celtic's second goal in a 4\u20130 win away at St Mirren.[72] Stokes, however, had a relatively poor season up that point.[73] In 30 appearances for Celtic he had scored only seven goals.[74] However, the arrival of Leigh Griffiths during the January transfer window saw an improvement in Stokes' form and goal ratio, with the pair forming an impressive partnership up front.[75][76][77]\n\nStokes was sent off against Motherwell on 18 January for a late tackle on Keith Lasley,[78] but on his return from suspension scored seven goals in nine games,[74] including a hat-trick against St Johnstone,[76] to double his tally for the season.[74] Stokes helped Celtic clinch the league title on 26 March, scoring twice in a 5\u20131 win away at Partick Thistle, the first of which was his 100th goal in Scottish football[79] and the second of which was a superb volley from 12 yards into the top corner of the goal.[80] Stokes scored another hat-trick on 27 April in a home league match against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, and also provided an assist for Leigh Griffiths in a 6\u20130 win.[81] A week later, Stokes scored his 20th goal of the season in a home league 5\u20132 win over Aberdeen.[82]\n\nStokes scored a goal in each of Celtic's first two league games of the season, 3\u20130 and 6\u20131 wins over St Johnstone and Dundee United respectively.[83] However over the course of the season Stokes scored fewer goals than in previous seasons, mainly due to new manager Ronny Deila fielding him in a wide left role as opposed to his more recognised position as a striker.[84][85] Stokes' form at this time was often unimpressive, drawing criticism from supporters,[86][87] and he was also disciplined by the club after he returned to Celtic late from a trip to his home city of Dublin.[87] Stokes continued to feature on the left wing for Celtic though, and it was from his cross that Kris Commons scored the opening goal on 15 March 2015 in Celtic's 2\u20130 win over Dundee United in the League Cup Final.[88] He commented after the final, \"I do need to show that I can still bring something to the team and I thought I did that today. I felt fresher and sharper. I thought I contributed.\"[88] A few days later, Stokes provided the assist for Jason Denayer's opening goal in a 4\u20130 win over Dundee United in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead.  However, Stokes was sent off later in the same game for elbowing United's Paul Paton.[89]\n\nIn the week leading up to Celtic's opening league match of the season on 1 August 2015, Stokes was told by Celtic manager Ronny Deila that he was no longer part of his long-term plans for the side.[90] By October he had made only two first team appearances, and in most games failed to even make the substitutes bench, with Deila again highlighting issues with his discipline.[91] On failing to again even make the substitutes bench for a league match away at Inverness on 29 November, Stokes expressed his frustration in posts made on Twitter.[92] These tweets resulted in Celtic suspending Stokes for two weeks, with Deila describing him as having a \"lack of respect\".[93] The transfer window in January 2016 saw Stokes linked with loan moves to Hibernian and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, having not taken part in a first team game since 22 August 2015.[94][95]\n\nOn 15 January 2016, it was reported that Stokes had agreed to join Hibernian on loan for the rest of the season.[96] He scored a late goal on his return to Hibs in a 3\u20131 win over St Mirren.[97] At the end of the season, Stokes scored two goals in the 2016 Scottish Cup Final and was named man of the match as Hibs won 3\u20132 against Rangers, their first win in the competition in 114 years.[98][99]\n\nOn 17 June 2016, Stokes signed for Blackburn Rovers on a three-year deal.[100] He scored on his Blackburn debut in a 4\u20131 loss to Norwich City on 6 August 2016[101] and followed it up with two goals in the EFL Cup First Round against Mansfield Town. In July 2017, Blackburn and Stokes agreed to terminate their contract.[102]\n\nStokes signed a two-year contract with Hibernian in August 2017.[103] He scored a double in his first start for the club against Ayr United in the Scottish League Cup on 8 August 2017.[104] Stokes scored 11 goals in 21 games during his third spell with Hibs, but he was dropped from the first team squad in January 2018 for breaching team disciplinary rules.[105] He was released from his contract on 30 January.[105]\n\nOn 7 February 2018, days before the end of the Greek transfer window for unattached players, Stokes signed with Super League side Apollon Smyrni,[106] on an 18-month deal. It didn't take long for Stokes to get into trouble again; he went missing from training for a week in April 2018, with the club announcing in a statement that \"we are looking if we can legally terminate his contract.\"[107]\n\nIt was reported on 20 June 2018 that Stokes was once again a free agent, and that he was back in Scotland training with St Mirren.[108] However, in July 2018, he signed a two-year contract with Tractor of the Persian Gulf Pro League.[109] He scored on his debut, netting in a 1\u20131 draw with Nassaji on 3 August.[110] On 28 September, he scored four goals in a 6\u20130 win over Esteghlal Khuzestan.[111] On 25 October 2018, having scored ten goals in nine games, Stokes extended his contract with Tractor until 20 June 2022.[112][113]\n\nIn November 2018, Stokes returned to Ireland with the permission of his coaching staff after a match against Zob Ahan. This was due to personal reasons, but he failed to return within the agreed week.[114][115] He did return later in the month, but then a week before the mid-season break he left again for Dublin for the same personal reasons, and was not expected to come back.[116] These \"personal reasons\" were later revealed to be a major problem with his family and his former girlfriend. The club offered to help him with the issue by allowing his mother, father and sister to live with him in Tabriz. This failed to persuade Stokes to return, however, and Tractor reported him to the legal department of FIFA with a view to terminating his contract.[117] In January, after a meeting in England with interim coach Mohammad Taghavi, Stokes decided to come back and play until the end of the season.[118]\n\nIn July 2019, it was reported that he had signed a contract with Turkish side Adana Demirspor yet still had a running contract with Tractor with 103 days (and counting) of unjustified absence.[119] Later Tractor informed the Turkish side about the illegality of signing Stokes to a contract without acquiring the consent of his current club and warned they could sue the player and the Turkish side.[120]\n\nOn 16 July 2019, Stokes signed for TFF First League club Adana Demirspor on a two-year contract, with the option of a third.[121][122] However, on 27 November, the club announced on their Twitter that his contract was terminated by the club, after only making six appearances and scoring one goal.[123][124]\n\nOn 25 January 2020, Stokes signed a six-month contract with Persian Gulf Pro League champions Persepolis.[125][126] Stokes chose number 10, but according to the rules, a number in a competition belongs to only one person, and as Farshad Ahmadzadeh wore number 10 at Persian Gulf Pro League and Iranian Hazfi Cup, Stokes chose number 32 till the end of the season, and number 10 from the beginning of 2020 AFC Champions League.[127]\n\nFollowing Persepolis' match against Sharjah on 18 February, he obtained permission to stay in United Arab Emirates for one more day to visit his son.[128] After remaining in UAE for longer that he was permitted, he announced that he did not intend to return to Iran due to the coronavirus pandemic there which led to him being fined by his club.[129]\n\nOn 4 March 2020, Stokes' agent negotiated with Persepolis' president. Stokes stated that due to the restrictions on air travel (due to the coronavirus), he was not able to return to Iran. Iran's league matches were also cancelled due to the outbreak. He announced that he would return to Persepolis after the situation improved.[130][131] On 30 May, Persepolis announced that his contract was terminated due to his absence and the club will seek compensation.[132]\n\nOn 22 August 2020, Stokes signed a one-year deal with Scottish Premiership club Livingston.[133] He left on 15 September, without having played for the club, as he disliked training on artificial pitches.[134]\n\nStokes played for the Republic of Ireland at youth international levels, earning promotion to the under-21 team in August 2006.[135]\n\nStokes earned his first full cap for the Republic of Ireland national football team in their 2\u20131 win away to San Marino on 7 February 2007, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Shane Long.[136] He earned three full caps in 2007, but was not selected during 2008 or 2009 as he fell out of favour at Sunderland. His form with Hibernian earned him a recall in May 2010.[137] Stokes scored the only goal of the game in a practice match against an Ireland under-23 side.[137]\n\nAt the start of the 2010\u201311 season, Stokes was included in the under-21 team to play Estonia, along with other senior fringe players.[138] He scored two goals and set up two others in a 5\u20130 win.[139] He and Cillian Sheridan were then added to the senior squad for their game against Argentina the next day.[139]\n\nIn May 2011, Stokes withdrew from the Ireland squad for the 2011 Nations Cup due to tiredness. Manager Giovanni Trapattoni expressed his disappointment and said he felt a footballer should only withdraw from a national squad if they were, \"in hospital or dead\". However, he also stated that he would still consider Stokes for future selection.[140] In February 2012 Stokes said that he felt it was unlikely he would be picked for Ireland's squad for UEFA Euro 2012 despite good form for Celtic, as he thought Trapattoni was holding his 2011 withdrawal against him.[141]\n\nStokes was re-called to the Ireland squad in October 2013 following the departure of Trapattoni, by interim manager Noel King.[142] He won his fifth cap in a 0\u20133 defeat away in Germany, a result which ended the Irish hopes of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup,[143] and also played four days later in a home 3\u20131 win over Kazakhstan.[144] Stokes won a further two caps during November 2013 in friendly internationals against Latvia and Poland.[145] He won his final cap for Ireland in November 2014, playing in a 4\u20131 win over the United States in Dublin.[145]\n\nOn 8 June 2013, Stokes attacked and head-butted car park attendant Anthony Bradley, in Buck Whaley's nightclub on Lower Leeson Street in Dublin. Stokes subsequently agreed to pay Bradley \u20ac30,000 for breaking his nose and two of his teeth, in what was later described in court as a \"nasty, cowardly attack\".[146] Bradley subsequently sued Stokes in the High Court in Dublin, having paid \u20ac13,500 over three-and-a-half years in medical expenses, stopped working due to physical and psychological effects; he was subsequently diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition. At the trial Stokes pleaded guilty to assault, and was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years. Bradley was awarded a sum of \u20ac232,000 by the judge, made up of: \u20ac150,000 in general damages; \u20ac50,000 in aggravated damages; and \u20ac32,000 for medical expenses.[146][147]\n\nIn September 2019, Stokes pleaded guilty to stalking his ex-girlfriend and her mother at Hamilton Sheriff Court in Scotland. He received an eight-month deferred sentence and was prohibited from contacting either woman for four years, apart from to arrange the custody of his two-year-old son.[148]\n\nStokes breached his restraining orders relating to both victims in November and December 2019. He missed his sentencing in August 2022 due to contracting COVID-19 and did not attend the rescheduled hearing the following month, leading to an arrest warrant being issued by the sheriff.[149]\n\nIn January 2022, a prosecution for an alleged headbutting incident in Temple Bar, Dublin in March 2019 was struck out due to the failure of a witness to appear.[150]\n\nOn 6 January 2023, Stokes and another man were arrested in Crumlin, Dublin on suspicion of dangerous driving; the Gardai allegedly found \u20ac4,500 worth of drugs in the vehicle. The two men were charged and bailed.[151]\n\nSunderland\n\nCeltic\n\nHibernian\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Stokes"}, {"id": 120, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/24/476619/original/anton-ferdinand-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Anton Ferdinand", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/anton-ferdinand/476619", "desc": "Anton Julian Ferdinand (born 18 February 1985) is an English footballer who most recently played for St Mirren as a defender.

He was a product of the West Ham United academy and has also played for their senior team, Queens Park Rangers, Sunderland, Bursaspor, Antalyaspor and Reading. He has also played for England at under-21 level. Ferdinand retired from professional football in July 2019.[5]\n\nFerdinand was born in Peckham, Greater London,[6] to Janice from Ireland and Julian from Saint Lucia.[7] His brother, Rio, played for West Ham United and Manchester United, and is a former captain of the England national football team; and his cousin, Les, is a former England international.[8] Anton showed considerable talent from an early age. Like his brother, Rio, he preferred to play in defence. His ability in this position led to him being signed to West Ham United's academy.\n\nFerdinand joined West Ham aged nine[9] signing a three-year contract in the summer of 2002.[10] He was handed his first team debut, by manager Glenn Roeder, in August 2003 when he started the 2\u20131 victory at Preston North End on the 2003\u201304 season's opening day.[11] He went on to feature in 26 games that season.[12]\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, he cemented his first team place with several key performances including scoring the opening goal, and his first for West Ham, on the final day of the season as West Ham beat Watford 2\u20131 at Vicarage Road to make the play-offs.[13][14] In the Final Ferdinand was a member of the team which beat Preston 1\u20130, earning them promotion back into the Premier League after an absence of two years.[15] At the end of July 2005, Ferdinand signed a three-year contract extension with the club.[16]\n\nFerdinand won the Premier League Player of the Month award in January 2006, following his brother Rio to become the first brothers to win the award.[17] In the 2006 FA Cup Final against Liverpool in Cardiff, Ferdinand fell to his knees after missing the decisive penalty in the shoot out.[18] During the 2005\u201306 season, Ferdinand was linked with reigning Spanish champions FC Barcelona.[19][20]\n\nIn March 2007 it was revealed that Ferdinand had been fined two weeks' wages (estimated at \u00a345,000) for lying about his whereabouts. Ferdinand told the club he needed to go to the Isle of Wight to visit his grandmother when in fact, he went to South Carolina to celebrate his 22nd birthday. West Ham lost the following game to relegation rivals Charlton Athletic 0\u20134.[21] His last goal for West Ham was against Fulham on 12 January 2008, scoring in the 69th minute to put West Ham 2\u20131 ahead, which proved to be the winning goal.[22]\n\nOn 27 August 2008, Ferdinand signed for Sunderland for an undisclosed fee on a four-year deal.[23] Sunderland manager Roy Keane also stated after the signing of Ferdinand that he viewed him as a future England International.[24] Ferdinand made a promising start to his Sunderland career in a partnership formed with Danny Collins but Sunderland's poor results at the start of the 2008\u201309 season saw Keane experiment with several different back four line-ups resulting in Ferdinand being in and out of the side.[25][26] Following captain Dean Whitehead's departure to Stoke City in July 2009, Nyron Nosworthy took Whitehead's vacated number 6 jersey and Ferdinand switched from number 26 to number 5. Ferdinand fell out of favour with new manager Steve Bruce and first team opportunities became limited and he was not initially given a squad number for the 2010\u201311 Premier League season as loan-signing John Mensah was given Ferdinand's number 5 shirt, but was later given number 29.[27]\n\nOn 31 August 2011, Sunderland accepted a bid from Queens Park Rangers for Ferdinand.[28] The transfer was confirmed on 1 September. He made his debut on 12 September, playing the full 90 minutes, alongside Danny Gabbidon in a 0\u20130 draw with Newcastle United at Loftus Road.[29] On 23 October, in a match between QPR and Chelsea, Ferdinand alleged racial abuse by Chelsea captain, John Terry, claiming Terry called him a \"fucking black cunt\" during the game; a claim denied by Terry.[30] On 1 November, the Metropolitan Police announced a formal investigation into the allegations.[31] On 1 February 2012 at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Terry was accused of a racially aggravated public order offence in relation to the game at Loftus Road on 23 October. He entered a not-guilty plea and stood trial on 9 July.[32] On 13 July, after a four-day trial, Terry was acquitted.[33] In July, following the court hearing Terry was charged by The Football Association with \"using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Ferdinand and which included a reference to colour and/or race contrary to FA Rule E3[2]\". In September 2012, after a four-day hearing, he was found guilty, banned for four games and fined \u00a3220,000.[34] On 9 August 2013, Ferdinand was released by Queens Park Rangers in an effort to cut costs, the club having been relegated to the Championship.[35]\n\nIn January 2013, after struggling for a first-team place with QPR, Ferdinand joined Turkish club Bursaspor on loan until the end of the season.[36] Ferdinand played seven games for Bursaspor helping them to fourth place in the 2012\u201313 Super League and a qualifying position in the 2013\u201314 Europa League.[37]\n\nOn 14 August 2013, Ferdinand signed for Turkish team Antalyaspor on a three-year contract.[38] At the end of the 2013\u201314 season he was released by the club.\n\nFerdinand was heavily linked with a move to Police United of the Thai Premier League during the summer of 2014.[39] The next week, he arrived in Bangkok to sign for Police United on 18 June 2014.[40][41] He and Teeratep Winothai were unveiled as new Police United signings in a press conference on 20 June and he said former QPR teammate Jay Bothroyd, who plays for Muangthong United convinced him to move to Thailand.[42] The BBC later reported that the move had fallen through and that Ferdinand was in advanced negotiations with Championship side Reading[43] with the CEO of Police United, Samrit Bunditkitsada, being part of a consortium which bought a 90% stake in the English club in July.[44][45]\n\nOn 11 August 2014, Ferdinand signed a two-year deal with Reading on a free transfer.[46] Ferdinand did not make his Reading debut until 4 November 2014. He had been side-lined with a hamstring injury but played the first half in a 3\u20130 home win against Rotherham United.[47] Reading announced on 9 May 2016, that Ferdinand would leave Reading when his contract expired at the end of June 2016.[48]\n\nOn 27 August 2016, Ferdinand signed for Southend United on a one-year deal.[49] On 9 August 2017, Ferdinand signed a new two-year contract to stay at Southend United.[50] At the end of the 2017\u201318 season he was transfer listed by the club.[51] On 31 August 2018, he left the club by mutual consent and became a free agent.[52]\n\nOn 14 September 2018, he joined Scottish Premiership side St Mirren.[53] In January 2019, Ferdinand signed a contract extension with St Mirren \u2013 keeping him at the club until the end of the season.[54] In May 2019, Ferdinand confirmed that he was leaving Saints at the end of his contract.[55]\n\nFerdinand was a regular selection for England's Under-21 side, having made his d\u00e9but in a 3\u20131 win over Ukraine at the Riverside Stadium on 17 August 2004.[9]\n\nFerdinand was selected to be part of the England squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in the Netherlands, and given the number 5 shirt. Going into the tournament whilst recovering from an injury, he made only one appearance, as substitute, in the semi-final against the hosts. The match finished 1\u20131 after extra time, and in the penalty shootout which followed, he scored one and missed one as the Netherlands won 13\u201312.[56] This was his final U21 appearance.\n\nFerdinand is also eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland national team through his mother, and the St. Lucian national team through his father.[57]\n\nFerdinand is a Christian. He is the brother of former footballer Rio Ferdinand. He is the cousin of Les Ferdinand, a former Queens Park Rangers striker, and Kane Ferdinand, a midfielder for Maidenhead United.[58]\n\nIn October 2006, Ferdinand was arrested on assault charges following a fracas outside a nightclub in Ilford. He was charged in November 2006.[59] He appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 12 November 2007 charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, arising from this incident. It was alleged that Ferdinand had punched Emile Walker. In his defence, Ferdinand said he had feared he was going to be robbed of his \u00a364,000 watch and was defending himself.[60] On 20 November 2007, Ferdinand was acquitted as the jury accepted he was acting in self-defence.[61]\n\nFerdinand is an Athlete Ambassador for the charity Right To Play.[62]\n\nOn 2 November 2011, John Terry was placed under police investigation following an allegation of racist abuse made at Ferdinand during a match versus Queens Park Rangers.[63][64] Video footage circulated on the internet led to accusations that Terry called Ferdinand a \"fucking black cunt.\" In response to the video footage, Terry claimed that he was actually asking Ferdinand, \"Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a black cunt?\"[65] On 25 November 2011, Terry was interviewed under caution by the police.[66] On 21 December 2011, he was charged with using racist language by the Crown Prosecution Service.[67] On 3 February 2012, the Football Association stripped Terry of his England captaincy for the second time, stating that Terry would not captain the national team until the racial abuse allegations against him were resolved.[68]\n\nWhen the trial began in July 2012, Terry entered a not guilty plea and was acquitted of the charge on 13 July 2012. The court established that neither Ferdinand nor anyone else had heard Terry's words, but Terry himself admitted that he had directed the words \"fucking black cunt\" and \"fucking knobhead\" at Ferdinand, which was affirmed by two expert lip readers from video evidence. Terry maintained that he used the words as a form of sarcasm and that he was questioning what he thought had been an allegation of racism from Ferdinand; neither lip reader was able to \"identify whether the statement was made as a question or in what type of voice it was said.\" Chief Magistrate Riddle concluded that while there was no doubt Terry had uttered those words in anger, \"it is impossible to be sure exactly what were the words spoken by [Terry] at the relevant time\" and that there was a lack of evidence to prove beyond a doubt that Terry had used them as an insult instead of \"a challenge to what he believed had been said to him.\" The court therefore found Terry not guilty.[69][70]\n\nOn 27 July 2012, the FA charged Terry for using \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour\" which \"included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand.\" The FA had delayed the charge until after the conclusion of Terry's criminal trial. Terry denied the charge.[71] On the eve of the FA's hearing, Terry announced his retirement from the England national football team, saying his position had become \"untenable\" due to the disciplinary charge. On 27 September 2012, the hearing concluded with Terry being found guilty; he was punished with a four-match ban and a \u00a3220,000 fine.[72]\n\nThe FA published a 63-page report[73] regarding the disciplinary proceedings conducted by an Independent Regulatory Commission; it labelled aspects of Terry's defence as \"improbable, implausible and contrived,\" finding it \"inherently unlikely that if he had been accused by Mr. Ferdinand of calling him something that ended with the words \"black cunt\", that Mr. Terry would have added the word \"fucking\" when he threw the words back, if he was genuinely doing so by way of forceful denial\" and \"inherently improbable\" that he would call Anton Ferdinand a \"fucking knobhead\" for falsely accusing him of racial abuse. The Commission found it \"implausible\" that to robustly deny having used the words \"black cunt\" he \"simply repeated\" them. His defence in court was not that he had \"simply repeated\" the words but that he had \"sarcastically\" repeated them (see above); however, there was no reference to sarcasm in the Regulatory Commission's 63-page written report. The Commission concluded that it was \"quite satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that there [was] no credible basis for Mr. Terry's defence that his use of the words 'fucking black cunt' were directed at Ferdinand by way of forceful rejection and/or inquiry. Instead, [the Commission was] quite satisfied, and [found] on the balance of probabilities, that the offending words were said by way of insult.\"[74][75]\n\nThe FA commission was also criticised as a \"kangaroo court\" and the FA for its lack of independence, for failing to disclose all evidence to the police, failing to tape record their interview with key witness Ashley Cole, for lowering the required burden of proof after the incident had taken place,[76] and for punishing Terry for an offence he had already been cleared of in a criminal court,[77][78][79] in contravention of its own rules, which state that verdicts in criminal cases are \"presumed to be correct\" unless \"clear and convincing evidence\" to the contrary emerges.[80] Terry's four-match ban was contrasted with Luis Su\u00e1rez's eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra (Su\u00e1rez received a longer ban for using the insults repeatedly) and a 14-year-old schoolboy's five-match ban for telling a referee his name was Santa Claus.[77][78]\n\nOn 18 October 2012, Terry decided not to appeal against the verdict and his four-match ban. He issued an apology for \"the language [he] used in the game\" and stated that it was \"not acceptable on the football field or indeed in any walk of life.\" Chelsea announced that they had taken further disciplinary action against Terry while keeping the details confidential.[81] However, Terry and Chelsea still faced media condemnation; Terry was criticised for not directly and personally apologising to Ferdinand, while Chelsea were accused of hypocrisy and double standards by only fining Terry and not stripping him of his captaincy when they have a \"zero-tolerance\" approach to racism and had previously handed a life ban to a fan who racially abused former Chelsea player Didier Drogba.[82] In a radio interview, Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Ron Gourlay called the incident a \"lapse of judgement\" and \"out of character\" from Terry and stated that the club had \"taken firm disciplinary action appropriate to the circumstances,\" adding that \"we must not forget he was cleared in a court of law.\"[83]\n\nIn November 2020, the BBC broadcast Anton Ferdinand: Football, Racism and Me, a programme looking at racism and the incident with Terry in 2011.[84][85] While promoting the programme on Instagram, Ferdinand received racist abuse by being sent monkey and banana emojis.[86]\n\nIndividual\n\nWest Ham United\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Ferdinand"}, {"id": 121, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/113/2243660/original/tibor-tisza-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Tibor Tisza", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/tibor-tisza/2243660", "desc": "Tibor Tisza (born 10 November 1984) is a Hungarian footballer.", "full_desc": "\n\nTibor Tisza (born 10 November 1984) is a Hungarian footballer.\n\nTisza started to play football in his hometown, Debrecen but played only in the reserve team of Debreceni VSC.

In 2006 Kostadinov joined Heart of Midlothian as an amateur player. He was unable to play in competitive under-19 matches until his country joined the European Union.[2]\nIn season 2007\u201308 he was part of the first team pre-season in Germany, where he scored his first senior goal for the club in a 2\u20131 defeat to BV Cloppenberg. After that, he played for Hearts U-19 in 2007\u20132008. In the next 2008\u201309 season Kostadinov played in reserve squad of Hearts never making the grade before being released without playing for the first team.\n\nAfter the end of 2008\u201309 season Kostadinov was released by Hearts along with many other players and returned to Bulgaria. He had been invited by Chernomorets Burgas to join trial period, which began on 2 June 2009.\n\nOn 15 June Kostadinov played for the reserve squad in a match against Vihren. He scored two goals and provided three assists in a 6\u20130 win.\n\nA few days later, on 20 June, Kostadinov signed a three-year contract with Chernomorets Burgas.

After progressing through their youth system, he made his first-team debut in 2001. He made 122 appearances and scored 48 goals in the league for Ipswich, before joining Charlton Athletic for a fee of \u00a32.5\u00a0million in 2005. He was Charlton Athletic's top goalscorer for two consecutive seasons and joined Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record fee of \u00a316.5\u00a0million in 2007. After two seasons at Tottenham, he joined Sunderland. After a successful 18 months at Sunderland, he joined Aston Villa in 2011. Bent had loans with Fulham, Brighton & Hove Albion and Derby County, and after being released by Villa in 2015, joined Derby permanently.\n\nBent represented England at under-15, under-16, under-19, under-21 and senior levels. He made 14 appearances and scored 9 goals for the under-21 team after making his debut against Italy in 2003. He made his debut for the senior England team in 2006 against Uruguay, and went on to make 13 appearances for England, scoring four goals. He scored his first goal on 7 September 2010 in a 3\u20131 UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match victory against Switzerland.\n\nBent progressed through Ipswich Town's youth system, having joined the club at age 14 in 1998, after considering a possible career in athletics.[4] He signed a professional contract with Ipswich on 2 July 2001.[5] He made his first-team debut on 1 November 2001 in a 3\u20131 victory against Helsingborg in the UEFA Cup, and scored his first senior goal in a 4\u20131 League Cup defeat to Newcastle United on 27 November 2001.[6] Bent scored his first Premier League goal on 24 April 2002 in a 1\u20130 win over Middlesbrough.[6] He finished the 2001\u201302 season with seven appearances and two goals in all competitions, and also saw his team Ipswich face relegation into the First Division.[6]\n\nHe became a key part of Ipswich's first-team squad during the 2002\u201303 season. He scored his first goal of the season on 24 August, scoring the equalizing goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Millwall. On 31 October 2002 he scored the winning goal against Slovan Liberec in the UEFA Cup. On 2 March he scored in a 2\u20130 win against Norwich City in the East Anglian derby. Bent finished the 2002\u201303 season with 18 goals,[7] while also winning Ipswich's Young Player of the Year award.[8]\n\nBent signed a new contract with Ipswich on 13 June 2003, signing a deal until June 2006.[9] He continued to feature regularly during the 2003\u201304 season. On 16 March, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20131 win over Walsall. Ipswich finished 5th in the league in the 2003\u201304 season, eventually losing out to West Ham United over two legs in the play-offs, with Bent scoring the winning goal in the first-leg as Ipswich won 1\u20130 at Portman Road, before losing the second-leg 0\u20132. Bent finished the season as Ipswich's top-scorer with 16 goals.[10]\n\nHe once again helped Ipswich challenge for promotion during the following season, continuing his goal scoring form alongside strike partner Shefki Kuqi. Ipswich finished 3rd in the 2004\u201305 season, narrowly missing out on automatic promotion by two points, before losing out to West Ham United in the play-off semi-finals for the second consecutive season. He finished the season with 20 goals, being the team's joint highest goalscorer along with Shefki Kuqi.[11]\n\nBent completed a transfer to Charlton Athletic on 1 June 2005, which was worth an initial fee of \u00a32.5\u00a0million, but would have risen to \u00a33\u00a0million if he made an agreed number of appearances for Charlton and for England.[12] On the opening day of the 2005\u201306 Premier League season, Bent scored two goals on his Charlton debut against Sunderland,[13] and was named Premier League Player of the Month for August.[14] He scored in his first four appearances for the club, one of only six players to perform this feat in the Premier League.[15] Bent was the highest scoring Englishman in the Premier League in 2005\u201306, with 18 goals (22 overall), which made him third highest scorer[16] and was given Charlton's Player of the Year award.[17] He signed an extension to his contract at Charlton in July, which contracted him until June 2010.[18] Bent finished 2006\u201307 with 13 goals in the Premier League, again finishing as Charlton's top goalscorer, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated into the Championship after seven successive seasons of Premier League football.[19] Charlton accepted a bid from West Ham United for him in June 2007, but Bent was not interested in a move to the club.[20]\n\nBent completed a move to Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record fee of \u00a316.5\u00a0million on 29 June 2007, which was to be payable over three years and is inclusive of add-on payments.[21] Ipswich were entitled to 20% of Charlton's profit on Bent under a sell-on clause, which gave the club an initial \u00a32.58\u00a0million.[22] He scored his first competitive goal for Tottenham in a 4\u20130 home victory over Derby County in August 2007.[23] This was followed up by scoring in the 6\u20131 win over Anorthosis Famagusta in the first round of the UEFA Cup on 20 September 2007.[24] Bent was an unused substitute for the 2008 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium on 24 February, as Tottenham beat Chelsea 2\u20131 after extra time.[25] He scored his 100th career goal on 9 March 2008 in the added time of a 4\u20130 league win over West Ham.[26] He also scored the 100th goal to be scored at White Hart Lane during 2007\u201308 on 22 March in a 2\u20130 win over Portsmouth.[27] Bent went on to score one more goal in the 2007\u201308 season, against Newcastle United, which he finished with 36 appearances and 8 goals.[28]\n\nBent scored 12 goals for Tottenham during the 2008\u201309 pre-season.[29] His first league goal of the season came against Chelsea, which gave his team a 1\u20131 draw.[30] He scored a header in the second half of Tottenham's UEFA Cup first round match against Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w, giving the team a 2\u20131 victory.[31] On 6 November, in a match against Dinamo Zagreb, Bent scored his first competitive hat-trick for Tottenham.[32] He followed this up with two goals in a 2\u20131 victory against Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium.[33]\n\nA miss in front of an open goal in the final minutes during a home match against Portsmouth in January 2009, which cost Tottenham two points, prompted manager Harry Redknapp to claim, \"You will never get a better chance to win a match than that. My missus could have scored that one.\"[34] On 31 January, Bent scored two goals in the period of two minutes against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium after coming on as a second-half substitute, in a match that eventually finished as a 3\u20132 defeat.[35] Following the return of striker Robbie Keane at Tottenham, Redknapp assured Bent of his future at the club.[36] He finished the season as Tottenham's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 43 matches.[37]\n\nSunderland opened negotiations to sign Bent in July 2009.[38] The deal seemed delayed and through social networking website Twitter he accused club chairman Daniel Levy of disrupting his move to Sunderland, although Bent later apologised, saying he acted out of frustration.[39] He travelled to Sunderland to sign for the club after they agreed a fee with Tottenham, and after passing a medical, Bent signed for Sunderland on 5 August for an initial fee of \u00a310\u00a0million plus potential additional payments, which later rose to \u00a316.5\u00a0million.[40] He scored on his Sunderland debut, which was the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory against Bolton,[41] and was followed with Sunderland's opening goal against Chelsea in a 3\u20131 defeat.[42] He scored a brace in the 4\u20131 win over Hull City to give himself his third and fourth goals in five matches.[43]\n\nBent scored Sunderland's only goal against Burnley at Turf Moor, making the score 1\u20131, before losing 3\u20131.[44] He scored again in a 5\u20132 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers,[45] although after the match, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce was left angry at Bent's decision to give Sunderland's second penalty kick to teammate Kenwyne Jones, after the latter \"pleaded\" with Bent to take the penalty so that he could get on the score sheet.[46] Bent scored in a 1\u20130 victory against Liverpool on 17 October 2009 when his shot hit a beach ball thrown onto the field by a Liverpool fan and past confused goalkeeper Pepe Reina into the net.[47] He scored his first hat-trick for Sunderland in a 4\u20130 victory over Bolton on 9 March 2010.[48] He scored two goals, one a penalty, but missed two other penalties as they were saved by Heurelho Gomes in a 3\u20131 victory against former club Tottenham on 3 April.[49] Bent finished the 2009\u201310 season with 25 goals in 40 appearances in all competitions,[50] 24 of which came in the Premier League, amounting to 50% of Sunderland's 48 goals in the league that season.[51] He was named as Sunderland's Player of the Year.[52]\n\nBent made his first appearance of 2010\u201311 in the opening match, a 2\u20132 draw with Birmingham City on 14 August and opened the scoring with a penalty in the 24th minute.[53] He scored the winning goal with stoppage time penalty as Sunderland beat Manchester City 1\u20130 on 29 August.[54] Bent scored the equaliser during stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 1\u20131 draw against Arsenal on 18 September.[55] He then scored twice in Sunderland's 2\u20132 draw at Liverpool.[56]\n\nOn 17 January 2011, Bent submitted a transfer request, amid reports that Aston Villa had made a club-record \u00a318\u00a0million bid for him, which was rejected.[57] Villa then submitted an improved offer of \u00a318\u00a0million, potentially rising to \u00a324\u00a0million, which was then accepted.[58] The following day, Bent completed his move to Villa and signed a four-and-a-half-year deal.[59] He scored the winning goal on his debut against Manchester City in a 1\u20130 victory at Villa Park.[60] Bent scored his second Villa goal in his third appearance for his team when he completed the full 90 minutes against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 3\u20131 away defeat.[61] Bent scored both of Villa's goals in their 2\u20131 away victory over Arsenal in the penultimate match of the season on 15 May. The first was a nicely crafted volley after he chested down a Kyle Walker chipped pass, with the second coming a few minutes later after a slip from Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen allowed Ashley Young the time to thread a pass through the Gunners' defence and Bent to sidefoot home for 2\u20130.[62] He finished the season with 9 goals in 16 Premier League appearances for Villa, becoming the club's joint top-scorer with Ashley Young, despite only joining in January.[63] He was also the top English goalscorer in the Premier League and the fourth highest scorer overall that season with 17 goals,[64] eight of which were scored for Sunderland.[63]\n\nIn his first full season with Villa, Bent scored his first goal of the season against Blackburn Rovers in a 3\u20131 victory on 20 August 2011.[65] In his first match against former club Sunderland, a 2\u20132 draw at the Stadium of Light on 29 October 2011, every time he received a touch on the ball, he was booed by the home support.[66] Bent then suffered an injury during the match against Bolton and was out for the next few matches as a result.[67] Bent caused controversy when a fan posted a picture and claimed the striker was out shopping while his teammates were losing 2\u20130 to Liverpool. It was later revealed Bent had been sent home to recover from his injury and afterwards he apologised to the Villa fans for his actions.[68] After apologising, Villa manager Alex McLeish reacted angrily to the \"conspiracy theory\" over Bent's absence for Villa.[69] This led to Bent having to deny a fall-out with McLeish.[70] Bent made his return as a 78th-minute substitute in the match against Chelsea on 31 December 2011, scoring the third goal to seal a 3\u20131 win at Stamford Bridge.[71] After not scoring in the next two matches, Bent went on a run by scoring in the next four matches for Villa, including his first FA Cup goal in a Villa shirt on 29 January 2012, against Arsenal in an eventual 3\u20132 defeat.[72] Three days later, Bent scored his 100th Premier League goal as Villa came from behind to earn a 2\u20132 home draw against Queens Park Rangers.[73] He was the 21st player to reach the milestone.[74]\n\nOn 25 February 2012, in a match against Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on his ankle after tangling with Antol\u00edn Alcaraz.[75] He was stretchered off the pitch with what was thought to be a serious injury.[75] This was confirmed two days later, after Bent had a scan on his ankle that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa and most likely his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012.[76] Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011\u201312 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad.[77] Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the hope he would be selected to play in the tournament.[78] Bent once again finished as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances and vowed to stay on at the club.[79][80]\n\nOn 28 August, Bent scored his first goal of 2012\u201313 in a 3\u20130 victory over League One team Tranmere Rovers in the second round of the League Cup, his first goal for Villa since February 2012.[81] Bent lost the Villa captaincy to Ron Vlaar, after the Dutchman was appointed captain for the 2\u20130 victory against Swansea City on 15 September 2012 and thereafter.[82] He scored his first league goal of the season on 22 September, in a 4\u20131 defeat away to Southampton.[83] Bent then lost his starting place for the next league match against West Bromwich Albion, after the performances of Gabriel Agbonlahor and Christian Benteke during the midweek League Cup victory over Manchester City saw the pair start up front.[84][85] However, after coming on for Benteke as a 68th-minute substitute, Bent scored the equaliser against West Brom in a 1\u20131 draw.[84]\n\nBent joined Villa's Premier League rivals Fulham on a season-long loan on 16 August 2013.[86] He scored his first goal for Fulham on 24 August 2013 on his debut, 18 minutes after replacing Damien Duff in a 3\u20131 defeat at home to London rivals Arsenal.[87] On 24 September, only three minutes after coming on for Adel Taarabt, he scored the winner in a 2\u20131 home win over Everton in the third round of the League Cup.[88] Again as a late substitute, this time for Dimitar Berbatov, he scored the only goal in Fulham's home league win over Stoke City on 5 October, taking control of Pajtim Kasami's shot and cutting past Robert Huth.[89]\n\nDespite scoring in the first match[90] and replay[91] against Norwich City in the third round of the FA Cup, Bent went 13 league matches without scoring before an added-time equaliser at Old Trafford to gain a 2\u20132 draw against Manchester United on 9 February after replacing Muamer Tankovi\u0107 at half-time.[92] He finished his loan with 6 goals in 30 matches, and Fulham were relegated into the Championship.[93]\n\nOn 26 November 2014, Bent joined Brighton & Hove Albion on a one-month loan.[94] Three days later, he scored on his debut for the Championship club, opening a 2\u20131 defeat to his former employers Fulham at Falmer Stadium.[95]\n\nAfter two goals in five appearances for Brighton, Bent was loaned to another Championship club, Derby County, on 2 January 2015. He was signed by his former international manager Steve McClaren on a deal lasting until the end of the season.[96] With his fourth goal in five matches, he equalised in a 2\u20132 draw away to then league leaders AFC Bournemouth on 10 February 2015.[97] Bent scored 12 goals from 17 appearances[98] as Derby finished in eighth place in the Championship table, missing out on a play-off place by one point.[99] He was released by Aston Villa on 8 June 2015,[100] ahead of a permanent transfer to Derby on a two-year contract, with a one-year option.[101]\n\nOn 26 January 2018, Bent joined fellow Championship side Burton Albion on loan for the remainder of the 2017\u201318 season.[102] He was yet to make a first team appearance for Derby during the 2017\u201318 season after suffering a pre-season hamstring injury.[102] He scored his first goal for Burton in a 3\u20131 loss away to Cardiff City on 30 March 2018.[103] On 21 April 2018 Bent scored a goal against his former club Sunderland as Burton came from a goal down to win 2\u20131 and condemn the former club to their second relegation in as many seasons.[104] He was released by Derby at the end of the 2017\u201318 season.[105]\n\nBent announced his retirement from playing on 25 July 2019.[106]\n\nBent made his debut for the England national under-15 team on 15 October 1999 as an 85th-minute substitute in a 2\u20131 win over Northern Ireland in the team's opening match at the 1999 Victory Shield.[107] He started the following match on 28 October 1999, scoring in the third minute as England beat Wales 3\u20131.[107] He played in all three matches, scoring once, as England won the tournament, topping the table with nine points.[107][108] Bent represented the under-15s at the 2000 Ballymena Tournament, starting in their first match on 24 April, a 1\u20130 defeat to Switzerland.[107] The following day, he scored England's four goals in their 4\u20130 win over Finland.[107] Bent scored in England's 3\u20132 win over Belgium on 29 April 2000 in the seventh-place match.[107][109] He finished his under-15 career with seven goals in eight appearances from 1999 to 2000.[107]\n\nBent made his under-16 debut on 31 July in their opening match at the 2000 Nordic Cup, coming on as a substitute as England beat Finland 2\u20131.[110][111] He scored in the 52nd minute of England's 3\u20130 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 August 2000, before starting in the final the following day, in which England were beaten 3\u20130 by Sweden.[110][111] Bent represented England at the 2001 Algarve Tournament, appearing as a substitute in the team's three matches as they were eliminated at the group stage.[110][112] He made 11 appearances and scored 3 goals for the under-16s from 2000 to 2001.[110]\n\nHis debut for the under-19 team came on 14 February 2002 when starting against Germany in a friendly, scoring two goals in a 3\u20131 victory.[113] Bent scored in the 33rd minute of a 1\u20131 draw with Lithuania on 17 April 2002 in the 2002 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification intermediary round first leg, with a 2\u20131 win in the second leg securing England's qualification for the tournament.[113][114] He finished his time with the under-19s with three appearances, scoring three goals, in 2002.[113]\n\nBent's first appearance for the under-21 team came on 11 February 2003 as a 71st-minute substitute against Italy in a friendly, which England lost 1\u20130.[115][116] His first goal came on his second appearance on 2 June 2003, with an 87th-minute winner in a 3\u20132 win over Serbia and Montenegro in a friendly.[115][117] He played in both leg's of England's 3\u20132 aggregate defeat to France in the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification play-offs, and scored in the 55th minute of the 2\u20131 defeat on 15 November 2005 in the second leg.[118][119] This was his last appearance for the under-21s, finishing his time with them with 14 appearances and 9 goals.[120]\n\nBent received his first call up to the senior England team for the friendly against Denmark on 17 August 2005,[121] but did not play in the match.[122] His England debut eventually came on 1 March 2006, when he started against Uruguay at Anfield in a pre-2006 FIFA World Cup friendly match.[123] He was not included in England's World Cup squad when it was announced in May 2006.[124]\n\nDespite having played for the senior team, Bent was recalled to the under-21 squad for their October 2006 qualification play-offs against Germany.[125] Later that month, he was recalled to the senior squad due to an injury to Andrew Johnson shortly after the squad's announcement.[126] He was called to the England squad for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia in November 2007.[127] He came on as an 80th-minute substitute as England lost 3\u20132 and failed to qualify for the tournament.[128] He was called up to the team for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Ukraine in March 2009 following an injury to striker Carlton Cole.[129] He made his second start for England in a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to Brazil on 14 November 2009.[130] Bent was named in England's preliminary 30-man squad for the 2010 World Cup on 11 May 2010,[131] although he was eventually omitted from the final 23-man squad on 1 June.[132]\n\nBent scored his first international goal in England's 3\u20131 away win over Switzerland after appearing as a substitute for Jermain Defoe in a Euro 2012 qualifier on 7 September 2010.[133] Then-England manager Fabio Capello stated he had been impressed with the improvement in Bent's all-round game since his World Cup omission[134] and selected him in the starting 11 for England's friendly with Denmark, where he scored a tap-in from a Theo Walcott cross. Bent retained his place for England's Euro 2012 qualifier with Wales to make his first competitive international start on 26 March 2011.[135] In scoring England's second goal, he took his tally to three goals in his last three matches.[136] Bent recovered from injury in time but was left out of the final 23-man squad for Euro 2012 as then-England manager Roy Hodgson felt Bent would not be fit enough to appear at the tournament.[137]\n\nBent was born in Tooting, Greater London,[138] to a family of Jamaican descent,[139] and grew up in Thornton Heath.[140] His father, Mervyn Bent, was a player in the youth systems of Wimbledon and Brentford.[141] At the age of 10, he moved to Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, where he attended Hinchingbrooke School and played in the Godmanchester Rovers youth system.[141] While at school, Bent competed in the long jump for England Schools.[142] His uncle Junior Bent and cousin Cory Bent were also professional footballers.[143]\n\nBent is a supporter of Arsenal and used to have a season ticket at Highbury.[144]\n\nHe was handed a formal caution by police in June 2004 after he was alleged to have shot a 12-year-old with a pellet gun.[145]\n\nIn 2019, Bent appeared on BBC's Celebrity Mastermind and scored a total of three points over two rounds; something he describes as \"the worst experience of my life.\"[146]\n\nBent refrains from drinking alcohol[147] and is a Christian.[148]\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nEngland U15\n\nEngland U16\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Bent"}, {"id": 125, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/33/659865/original/calum-davenport-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Calum Davenport", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/calum-davenport/659865", "desc": "Calum Ray Paul Davenport (born 1 January 1983) is an English former footballer.

Davenport scored his first league goal for Tottenham on 17 December 2006, being the first goal in a 2\u20131 victory away to Manchester City, scored from a Tom Huddlestone free-kick.[10] However, since joining Tottenham in 2004, he had struggled to establish himself in the first team and in January 2007, transferred to West Ham.[11]\n\nDavenport made twenty appearances for Tottenham in all competitions, scoring one goal.[2] While on loan, he made ten appearances for West Ham, twelve appearances for Southampton and 16 appearances for Norwich.[2]\n\nDavenport joined West Ham United for an undisclosed fee, reported to be \u00a33 million,[2] on 18 January 2007. He signed a three-and-a-half-year contract.[11] He made his first start in his second spell for the club two days later in a 2\u20132 draw against Newcastle United. He had a goal disallowed during this match by referee Uriah Rennie.\n\nOn 18 January 2008, he joined Championship side Watford on a month's loan,  with a view to a permanent deal.[12] Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd had previously been interested in signing Davenport when he was at Tottenham,[13] and he was to provide cover for Danny Shittu whilst he was at the African Cup of Nations.[12] Davenport made his debut against Charlton Athletic on 19 January 2008, but had to be substituted before half-time after a collision with teammate Darius Henderson.[14] He was stretchered off and taken to hospital, where he spent a number of days and was diagnosed with a fracture to a bone in his neck. His injury meant the loan deal was cancelled.[15][16]\n\nAfter a lengthy spell on the sidelines Davenport returned to competitive action for the start of the 2008-09 campaign. Injuries meant he found himself in the starting eleven against Wigan Athletic on the opening day. Davenport took his chance in the first team, impressing many critics with both his defending and goal threat from set pieces.[citation needed] He scored his first goal for The Hammers against Blackburn Rovers on 30 August 2008 when he headed in Julien Faubert's corner.[17] On 2 February 2009 he joined Premier League club Sunderland on loan until the end of the 2008\u201309 season.[18] He made eight appearances for Sunderland.[19] Davenport returned to West Ham for the start of the 2009\u201310 season but in August was involved in a stabbing incident. He did not play again for West Ham and in March 2010 his contract was terminated by mutual consent.[20] He played fourteen games in all competitions for West Ham scoring one goal. After being released by West Ham, Davenport joined Nottingham Forest on trial during the club's 2010 pre-season.[21]\n\nIn August 2010, Davenport started training with Leeds United. He started a trial period which was later confirmed by manager Simon Grayson.[22] In September 2010 Davenport returned home to think over his options.[23] On 8 September 2010,  Grayson revealed that Leeds were still interested in the player and were awaiting Davenport to think over his future.[24]\n\nIn September 2010 Davenport signed for United Counties team Wootton Blue Cross in order to gain some match fitness before returning to the professional ranks[25] and made his debut in a 4\u20130 defeat to Bourne Town.[26]\n\nOn 21 July 2021 it was announced that Davenport had signed for Tavistock who play in the Western League Premier Division.[27] On joining the Lambs, Davenport said: \u201cMy only focus at the minute is to get fit again and see where that leads. I thank Stuart [Stuart Henderson, Tavistock AFC's manager] and everyone at Tavistock for the opportunity and I hope I can help the club achieve its goal of promotion from the Western League.\u201d[27]\n\nDavenport played for the England national team at under-17, under-19[28] and under-21 levels.[5]\n\nIn the early hours of 22 August 2009, Davenport and his mother were stabbed at her home in Kempston, Bedfordshire. Davenport was stabbed in the legs, lost 50% of the blood from his body[29] and underwent emergency surgery for injuries described as serious. Two men were arrested the same day in connection with the stabbings. At Bedford Magistrates Court, on 24 August 25-year-old Worrell Whitehurst, the boyfriend of Davenport's sister, was remanded in custody charged with grievous bodily harm with intent in connection with the attack on Davenport, and with assault occasioning actual bodily harm to his mother; the second man was released on bail pending further inquiries. On 12 July 2010, Whitehurst was jailed for six years, for the attack on Davenport, after he had admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He also admitted a charge of unlawfully wounding Davenport's mother.[30]\n\nDue to the nature of the injury, his career was believed to be under threat.[31][32] On 16 October, Gianfranco Zola reported that Davenport had returned to Chadwell Heath for light training with the team following his release from the hospital.[33] His contract was terminated by mutual consent in March 2010.[20]\n\nOn 28 October 2009, Davenport was charged with assault on his sister, Cara Davenport, in an incident prior to that in which he was stabbed.[34][35] On 10 November 2009, Davenport appeared before Bedford magistrates court charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.[36] He pleaded not guilty and was bailed on the condition that he has no contact with his sister. During a hearing in December 2009, the case was committed to Luton Crown Court with the plea and directions hearing due on 25 January 2010. The magistrates court was told that he would plead not guilty.[37] On 25 January, Davenport pleaded not guilty to the charge at Luton Crown Court and the case was adjourned.[38] On 1 July, Davenport was cleared of all charges in regard to the alleged assault on his sister.[39]\n\nOn 18 March 2015, Davenport was arrested by Bedfordshire Police on suspicion of assault after playing in a local league match while playing for Elstow Abbey Football Club against Cranfield United.[40] On 22 March, Davenport was expelled from the club following the incident which had occurred in the changing room.[41]\n\nIn 2019, Davenport was running football coaching for children in Plymouth.[42]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calum_Davenport"}, {"id": 126, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/69/1360329/original/kelvin-etuhu-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Kelvin Etuhu", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/kelvin-etuhu/1360329", "desc": "Kelvin Peter Etuhu (born 30 May 1988) is a Nigerian footballer who plays for League Two club Carlisle United.

He scored on his debut for the club, coming on in the 56th minute against Wycombe Wanderers and scoring in the 80th minute.[3] His spell at Rochdale was cut short by a knee injury which prompted his return to Manchester City.[4]\n\nHe made his first appearance for Manchester City on 25 September 2007 against Norwich City in the League Cup, coming on as a substitute and setting up the winning goal for Georgios Samaras.

However, under the management of Keith Hill, Etuhu's playing time decreased, but after Hill's replacement by David Flitcroft, he was selected more often, with Flitcroft placing him in the central-midfield. In a 1\u20130 win over Watford on 16 March 2013, his performance earned him a man of the match award.[21] In his first season, Etuhu made thirty appearances in all competitions. At the end of the season, Etuhu was retained for another season,[22] after which he signed a two-year deal.[23][24]\n\nAfter two years at Barnsley, Etuthu was among ten players to leave the club.[25]\n\nOn 27 June 2014 Bury announced that Etuhu had signed a two-year deal after his release from Barnsley.[26] Upon joining the club, Etuhu was given number six shirt this season.[27]\n\nEtuhu made his Bury debut on 16 August 2014, in a 2\u20130 win over Hartlepool United.[28] Having established himself in the first team at Bury throughout the season, playing in various midfielder position,[29] Etuhu scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20130 win over Tranmere Rovers on 4 October 2014.[30] At the end of the 2014\u201315 season in which he made 46 appearances and scored twice in all competitions, Etuhu was offered a new contract by the club,[31] which he signed a two-year contract extension on 22 May 2015.[32]\n\nOn 29 June 2017, Etuhu signed for Carlisle United on a free transfer, signing a two\u2013year contract.[33] Upon joining the club, he was given a number 21 shirt.[34] On 12 September, he made his debut for Carlisle United, playing 77 minutes before being substituted, in a 2\u20130 loss to Coventry City.[35] He scored his first goal for the club on 25 November in a 1\u20131 draw against Morecambe.[36]\n\nOn 18 January 2019, Carlisle United opted to trigger their option of a contract extension that would ensure Etuhu remained under contract for another season.[37] He then suffered a number of hamstring injuries, keeping him sidelined for an extensive period.[38] By September, manager Steven Pressley said he was unsure on when Etuhu would return from his injury.[39] His hopes of returning was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, causing the season to end immediately.[40] Having made no appearances in the 2019\u201320 season, he was released by the club.[41]\n\nAfter being released by Carlisle United, Etuhu announced his retirement from football.[42]\n\nAlthough not capped at international level, Etuhu was eligible to play for England or Nigeria.

[28]\n\nOn 19 February 2020, Baxter joined American side Memphis 901 FC, a member of the second-tier USL Championship.[29]\n\nHe retired on 8 August 2021 at the age of 29.[30]\n\nBaxter has represented England at both U16 and U17 levels.[citation needed] He played in the first two games of the 2009 Under 17 European Championships but missed the third after picking up two yellow cards.[citation needed]\n\nHaving grown up on Merseyside, Baxter is a fan of local team Liverpool.[31] In October 2009, Baxter was one of three men arrested in Kirkby on suspicion of possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and on suspicion of possessing counterfeit money.[32] He was subsequently released without charge.[10]\n\nEngland U-16\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Baxter"}, {"id": 130, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/22/425124/original/aleksei-berezoutski-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Aleksei Berezutski", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/aleksei-berezoutski/425124", "desc": "Aleksei Vladimirovich Berezutski (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439; born 20 June 1982) is a Russian football coach and a former player who played as a centre-back.

Carlisle represented his home county of Lancashire at youth level. The start of his professional career was his Football League debut for Blackpool in September 1997. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three caps for the England under-21 national team. He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior cruciate ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over. He then missed one month of the 2003\u201304 season because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers at the end of that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined Leeds United on a free transfer.\n\nCarlisle spent just one season with Leeds United before signing for Championship club Watford in August 2005. In the 2005\u201306 season, his first with Watford, the team finished third in the division and achieved promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs. However, a thigh injury caused Carlisle to miss the majority of the team's season in the top flight. In March 2007 he had a one-month loan spell at Luton Town. In August 2007, Burnley manager Steve Cotterill bought Carlisle from Watford for a transfer fee of \u00a3200,000. In the 2008\u201309 season he played over 40 matches as Burnley reached the semi-finals of the League Cup and finished fifth in the league, earning a place in the play-offs. Carlisle was named man of the match for his performance in the play-off final as Burnley beat Sheffield United 1\u20130 to return to the top tier of English football for the first time in 33 years.\n\nAn imposing figure in the centre of defence thanks to his stature, Carlisle also provided an attacking threat from set pieces.\n\nHe is a practising Christian and regularly attends church. He attended Balshaw's Church of England High School where he attained 10 A-grades at GCSE and studied mathematics and politics at A-level, and in 2002 was awarded the title of \"Britain's Brainiest Footballer\" in a TV game show. He has been an ambassador for the Kick It Out campaign and is a former Chairman of the Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association. Carlisle has suffered from recurring problems with alcohol and depression.\n\nCarlisle was born in Preston, Lancashire.[1] He grew up in the city with his parents, Mervin and Rose (n\u00e9e Edgar).[3][4] He went on to study A-level mathematics and politics at Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College while he was unable to play football due to an injury.[5] Carlisle has a degree in Professional Sports Writing and Broadcasting from Staffordshire University,[6] and has expressed interest in taking up teaching work following his football career.[3]\n\nCarlisle was inspired to become a footballer by his father, Mervin, who played semi-professionally for Morecambe and Southport.[3][5] Carlisle started playing at a young age and represented Lancashire at under-15 level,[5] before being signed by Blackpool where he became a trainee with the youth team.[7] Carlisle signed a professional contract with the club on 13 August 1997 and moved into the first-team squad.[1] On 2 September 1997, he made his debut for Blackpool in the team's 4\u20133 victory over Wrexham in the Second Division.[8] He scored his first goal as a professional footballer with the 90th-minute winner in the following match, a 2\u20131 win against Carlisle United at Blackpool's home ground, Bloomfield Road.[8] He was shown the first red card of his career in Blackpool's 1\u20130 victory against Wigan Athletic in the quarter-final of the Football League Trophy on 27 January 1998.[8] He played 12 matches in his first season, scoring two goals.[8]\n\nThe following season, he played 43 matches as Blackpool achieved a 14th-placed finish in the Second Division.[9][10] His single goal of the campaign came in a 3\u20131 victory over Stoke City at the Victoria Ground.[8] In the 1999\u20132000 season, he played 51 times and scored five goals as Blackpool finished 22nd and were relegated to the Third Division.[11][12] He scored on his 93rd and final league appearance for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with Oldham Athletic at Boundary Park.[11] Despite the team's relegation, Carlisle's strong defensive performances during his three years at Blackpool attracted the attention of Iain Dowie, who at the time was a scout for Queens Park Rangers.[13][14]\n\nDowie recommended Carlisle to Queens Park Rangers manager Gerry Francis, who paid a transfer fee of \u00a3250,000 to sign him on 25 May 2000.[1][14] He played his first match for the team on 12 August 2000 in the 0\u20130 draw with Birmingham City at Loftus Road.[15] He made a further 31 appearances in the 2000\u201301 season and scored three times,[15] earning himself a call-up to the England national under-21 team. However, his season was cut short on 31 January 2001, when he suffered his first major injury after a tackle by Rufus Brevett during the 2\u20130 defeat to Fulham.[14] It was found that Carlisle had torn his posterior cruciate ligament, an injury which kept him sidelined for a year and caused doctors to believe that his career might be over.[16][17] While he was out of action, Queens Park Rangers suffered relegation to the Second Division after finishing 23rd in the league.[18] Soon after the injury he attempted suicide, and years later was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.[19] Upon his return to football, Carlisle was injured again in a reserve-team match against Bristol City, sparking fears that he had aggravated his previous injury.[17] The damage proved not to be particularly severe, although it delayed his return to training by a further month.[17]\n\n\"With the knowledge I have now, I realise it had been affecting my performance for a long time, I had been playing at nowhere near 100%. And there was the actual thoughts I was having at the time. At one stage I found I wasn't actually that bothered. Then I suddenly had a moment of clarity and thought: 'Clarke, what the hell are you doing?' It was when clarity set in that I felt my lowest. To be honest, I was scared.\"\n\nClarke Carlisle on his alcohol problem in 2003[16]\n\nAfter missing the entire 2001\u201302 campaign, Carlisle returned to competitive football on 7 September 2002 in Queens Park Rangers' 4\u20130 victory over Mansfield Town.[20] He scored two goals in 41 matches in the 2002\u201303 season, helping the team to a fourth-placed finish and a spot in the Second Division play-offs.[20] The club reached the 2003 Second Division play-off Final, but were defeated 1\u20130 by Cardiff City at the Millennium Stadium on 25 May 2003.[20] During the following season, Carlisle developed personal problems, including an alcohol addiction, although he continued to play for a number of months. He subsequently missed one month of the season after being admitted to Sporting Chance, a clinic run by former England international footballer Tony Adams, for 28 days for treatment for alcohol-related problems.[16] Upon his return to the team, Carlisle won the Second Division Player of the Month award for November 2003.[21] He scored one goal in 39 matches in 2003\u201304 as Queens Park Rangers finished as runners-up in the league, achieving promotion to the Championship.[22][23] Carlisle's contract with Queens Park Rangers ended at the conclusion of the 2003\u201304 campaign.[24]\n\nIn June 2004, Carlisle agreed to join recently relegated Championship club Leeds United on a free transfer.[24] He was offered a new contract by Queens Park Rangers, but he was keen to return to northern England and cut short his summer holiday in Tenerife to sign for the West Yorkshire club on a two-year contract.[25] His contract with Leeds began on 1 July 2004,[25] and he made his debut for the club in the 1\u20131 draw with Nottingham Forest on 21 August.[26] He scored his first goal for Leeds two matches later, netting the first goal in the team's 3\u20130 victory against Coventry City.[26] He was a regular in the team during the first half of the season, playing in every match from the start of September until the end of November.[26] However, he then experienced another major injury set-back, tearing his ankle ligaments during the 1\u20130 defeat to Rotherham United on 29 November 2004, an injury which left him out of action for a number of weeks.[27]\n\nWhen fit again, Carlisle found it difficult to break into the first team as his place in the centre of defence had been taken by Matthew Kilgallon.[28] His return came on 28 December 2004, when he was brought on as an 80th-minute substitute for Frazer Richardson in the 2\u20131 win against Plymouth Argyle.[26] He started the next league match, against Coventry City, but was shown a red card late on in the 2\u20131 victory at Highfield Road.[26] After his return from suspension, he was dropped from the team, making just a handful of substitute appearances in the following two months.[26] Carlisle regained his place in the team towards the end of the season, starting in each of the final four matches of the campaign.[26] He left Leeds in the summer of 2005, having spent one season at the club, playing 38 matches and scoring four times for the team as they reached the third round of the League Cup and attained a 14th-placed finish in the league.[29] At the end of the 2004\u201305 campaign it was revealed that two clubs, Watford and Stoke City, were both competing to sign Carlisle.[30] Leeds United accepted bids of \u00a3100,000 from both clubs but Carlisle chose to sign for Watford, and he agreed a three-year contract with the club on 5 August 2005.[30] The deal taking him to Vicarage Road included a clause in his contract stipulating that he would not be played against Leeds in the following season.[31]\n\n\"Clarke is a brilliant guy and if his football ability matched his personality, he would be captain of England!\"\n\nAidy Boothroyd[32]\n\nWatford manager Aidy Boothroyd, who had been a coach at Leeds during the previous season, was pleased with the signing, stating that Carlisle was \"exactly the type of defender I wanted\".[30] Carlisle was placed straight into Watford's starting line-up and played his first match for his new club on 6 August 2005, but he could not prevent the team losing 2\u20131 to Preston North End at Vicarage Road.[33] On 29 August 2005, Carlisle scored his first goal for the club, claiming the winning header in a 2\u20131 victory over Derby County at Pride Park.[33][34] Soon after, Carlisle scored two goals in a competitive match for the first time in his career, grabbing both in Watford's 2\u20131 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the second round of the League Cup.[33]\n\nOn 4 November 2005, Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Glenn Hoddle accused Carlisle of stamping on goalkeeper Michael Oakes in the match the previous weekend, and threatened to report him to the Football Association.[35] However, the referee did not show Carlisle a red or yellow card during the match, and no further action was taken against the player. During the 2005\u201306 campaign, Carlisle made 35 appearances and scored five goals, helping Watford to achieve a place in the play-offs after finishing third in the Championship.[33][36] However, towards the end of the season he suffered yet another injury, being forced off the pitch in Watford's penultimate league match away at Queens Park Rangers.[37] The thigh problem caused him to be unavailable for the play-offs as Watford defeated Leeds 3\u20130 at the Millennium Stadium to win promotion to the FA Premier League.[38]\n\nThe injury forced Carlisle to miss the first eight months of the 2006\u201307 Premier League season, and he eventually returned to full training in February 2007.[39] He played in two reserve team matches for Watford in order to regain some fitness, hoping to break into the first team and make his Premier League debut.[40] On 2 March 2007, Carlisle joined local rivals Luton Town on a one-month emergency loan deal in an attempt to return to full match fitness.[41] He made his debut for Luton the following day in the 3\u20132 away defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Championship, coming on as a substitute for Matthew Spring, who had himself joined the club from Watford earlier in the season after failing to break into the first team.[42][43] Carlisle went on to play five matches for Luton.[42] He made his final appearance on 31 March 2007, in a 0\u20130 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor, before returning to Watford on 2 April 2007.[42] He finally played his first Premier League match on 9 April 2007, starting in the 4\u20132 victory over Portsmouth.[42] He was selected to play in the team's following match, an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United, but despite being named man of the match for his performance,[44] Watford were defeated 4\u20131 at Villa Park.[42] Carlisle went on to play in Watford's following three league matches of the season as their relegation back to the Championship was confirmed after a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester City at Vicarage Road.[42][45]\n\nOn 14 August 2007, Steve Cotterill, manager of fellow Championship club Burnley, made an offer of \u00a3200,000 for Carlisle, who signed a three-year contract at Turf Moor two days later.[46][47] Helped along by the club captain Steven Caldwell, Carlisle settled in well at Burnley.[48] Two days after signing, he made his debut for his new club in the 2\u20130 defeat away to Scunthorpe United.[49] Carlisle scored his first goal for Burnley on 22 September 2007, netting a stoppage time minute equaliser with an overhead kick in the 2\u20132 draw with Bristol City at Ashton Gate.[50] On 28 September 2007, the day before a Championship match, he was involved in a serious car crash after spinning and crashing into a ditch causing his car to be written off.[51] Steve Cotterill praised Carlisle's character for playing the next day in the 1\u20131 draw with Crystal Palace.[51] He and Caldwell formed a solid defensive partnership and played most matches of the season together. Carlisle was named in the official Team of the Week for his performance in Burnley's 3\u20131 away win at Charlton Athletic.[52] His partnership with Caldwell was broken towards the end of the campaign as Carlisle was given suspensions after being sent off twice in his last four matches of the season, first in the 1\u20132 loss to Preston and then in the last match of the season, a 0\u20135 defeat at Crystal Palace. Carlisle ended the 2007\u201308 season with two goals in 35 appearances.[49]\n\nThe 2008\u201309 campaign was Burnley's first full season with Owen Coyle as manager. Carlisle managed to keep his place in the team under the new regime and was a regular fixture in the team for the first six months of the season.[53] However, he was dropped from the team for the match against Charlton on 31 January 2009 due to a lack of form.[54] He remained out of the team for the whole of February 2009.[53] He made his return to action on 3 March 2009, starting in the centre of defence in the 1\u20130 win over his old team, Blackpool, at Bloomfield Road.[53] On his next league appearance he scored Burnley's first goal in a 4\u20132 victory against Crystal Palace at Turf Moor.[53] He went on to score three further goals in the last two months of the season, getting his name on the scoresheet against Nottingham Forest, Southampton and his former team, Queens Park Rangers.[53] His goals helped Burnley to a fifth-placed finish in the Championship, and a place in the play-offs. He played in both legs of the semi-final against Reading as the team won 3\u20130 on aggregate to secure a place in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium.[53] Carlisle was handed the man of the match award for his performance as Burnley triumphed 1\u20130 against Sheffield United to earn promotion to the Premier League for the 2009\u201310 season.[55]\n\n\"I'm privileged to be a member of this magnificent team. What a season, words can't describe how brilliant and awesome an achievement this is. I thank God so much, I'm blessed to be a part of this team. It's just unbelievable, what an awesome day.\"\n\nClarke Carlisle on Burnley's promotion in 2009[55]\n\nPrior to the start of the campaign, Carlisle stated his belief that Burnley could avoid relegation back to the Championship.[56] He was selected in the team to play Burnley's first top-flight match in 33 years on 15 August 2009, when the team were defeated 2\u20130 by Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.[55][57] He also played in the following match as Burnley recorded their first ever Premier League victory, a 1\u20130 win over reigning champions Manchester United at Turf Moor.[58] During the early part of the season, he formed a defensive pairing with new signing Andr\u00e9 Bikey.[58] He was reunited with Caldwell in the centre of defence for the 2\u20131 victory over Birmingham on 3 October 2009.[57] In the away loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers on 20 December 2009, Carlisle suffered a groin injury which kept him sidelined over the Christmas period.[59] After over a month out of the Burnley team with the injury, he made his first start under new manager Brian Laws in the 1\u20130 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on 26 January 2010.[60] Although the team was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season, Carlisle was one of several players offered a new contract, and he signed a two-year extension in May 2010.[61]\n\nIn the first away match of the 2010\u201311 season, he scored an injury-time equaliser against Ipswich Town; the goal was Burnley's first from a corner kick for 15 months.[62] After serving a three-match suspension in October 2010 following a red card in the 1\u20131 draw away at Millwall,[63] Carlisle returned to the team for the League Cup tie against Aston Villa and scored an 89th-minute equaliser to take the match to extra time.[64] He made 41 appearances during the campaign but was not deemed a first-choice player by new manager Eddie Howe, and in July 2011 he joined his hometown club Preston North End on loan for the duration of the 2011\u201312 season.[64][65]\n\nCarlisle made his Preston debut in the opening match of the campaign, a 4\u20132 home defeat against Colchester on 6 August 2011.[66] Three matches later, he scored his first goal for the club, netting the opening goal from a corner kick in the 2\u20130 away win over Chesterfield.[66][67] He was a regular starter for Preston during the opening months of the season and also played in the cup competitions as the team reached the third round of the League Cup before being eliminated by Southampton and progressed to the same stage of the Football League Trophy with penalty shoot-out victories over Morecambe and Rochdale.[66] He was handed a one-match ban after receiving his fifth yellow card of the campaign in the FA Cup first round defeat to Southend United on 22 November 2011.[68] Preston manager Phil Brown brought in Jamie McCombe on loan as cover for Carlisle, and the Huddersfield Town loanee kept his place in the starting line-up throughout December 2011. Carlisle returned to the Preston team for the visit to Rochdale on 2 January 2012, when he was selected to play alongside Craig Morgan by caretaker managers Graham Alexander and David Unsworth.[68] He played five times during that month, scoring on his 27th and final appearance for the club in the 1\u20132 loss to Yeovil Town.[66] Following the appointment of Graham Westley as Preston manager, Carlisle struggled to fit the new training regime in with his commitments as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association and his loan deal was cancelled by mutual consent on 31 January 2012.[69]\n\nLater the same day, Carlisle signed for League Two club Northampton Town, managed by former Watford boss Aidy Boothroyd, on loan for the remainder of the season.[70] He made his first start for Northampton in the 1\u20130 win over AFC Wimbledon at the Sixfields Stadium on 14 February 2012.[66] Carlisle was appointed captain upon his arrival at the club and was a regular first team player, often playing alongside fellow centre-back Kelvin Langmead.[71] He scored his first goal for the team in the 3\u20131 home defeat to Bradford City on 14 April 2012.[66] Carlisle played 18 matches and scored one goal for Northampton during his three months with the club, making his final appearance in the final match of the campaign, a 1\u20131 draw away at Rotherham.[66] He was released by Burnley in May 2012 after the expiry of his contract.[72]\n\nCarlisle signed for newly promoted League Two club York City on 30 August 2012 on a contract lasting until January 2013,[73] having previously turned down a contract offer from Northampton.[74] He made his debut two days later in York's 3\u20131 victory at home to Oxford United.[75] On 19 November 2012, Carlisle re-signed for Northampton on loan until January 2013, when he would sign permanently, having made 14 appearances for York.[76] He made his second debut the following day in Northampton's 3\u20130 home win over Morecambe.[75] After making five appearances on loan, Carlisle completed his permanent move to Northampton on a one-and-a-half year contract on 4 January 2013.[75][77] He played for Northampton in their 3\u20130 defeat to Bradford in the 2013 League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 18 May 2013.[75] Five days later, Carlisle announced his retirement from playing.[78]\n\nWhile playing for Queens Park Rangers, Carlisle was selected to play for the England national under-21 team on three occasions. He was called up to the squad by Howard Wilkinson, and made his debut for his country on 31 August 2000, coming on as a substitute in England's 6\u20131 friendly victory over Georgia at the Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough.[79] His second appearance for England, also from the substitutes' bench, came in a 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying match on 6 October 2000 in the 1\u20131 draw with Germany at Pride Park.[79] He played his third and final match for England four days later, again coming on as a substitute in the 2\u20132 draw with Finland at the Tehtaan kentt\u00e4 stadium in Valkeakoski.[79] Despite playing well in the second half of the match,[80] he was not selected for the under-21 team again.\n\nCarlisle's predominant playing position is as a centre-back and he has been described as a \"defensive lynchpin\".[81] He has stated that as a youngster, he modelled his style of play on defenders such as Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister.[82] However, he says that their style was too \"ruthless\" for modern football, and he now attempts to read the opponents' attacking plays. He is not known for his pace,[81] and this has caused him some disciplinary problems as he has received eight red cards during his career. Former Leeds United teammate Michael Duberry described Carlisle as a \"strong\" defender.[83] Carlisle is recognised as being a highly intelligent footballer, and is often seen as an imposing figure in the centre of the defence thanks to his 6\u00a0ft\u00a03\u00a0in (1.91\u00a0m) stature.[81] He also looks to use his size to cause an attacking threat from set pieces such as free kicks and corner kicks,[84] and scored 39 goals in his career.\n\nCarlisle is an ambassador for the Kick It Out scheme, which campaigns for inclusion and equality in football.[3] He is also currently on the Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA),[85] and it was announced on 17 November 2010 that Carlisle would succeed Chris Powell as the chairman of the PFA.[86] As part of his work with the PFA, he collects the views of his fellow professionals and reports back to the committee.[87] He also visits local schools to give talks to the students.[87] Carlisle was among those who criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his comments in November 2011 that racism was no longer a problem in football.[88] In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation that met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the issues of racism and homophobia in the sport.[89]\n\nIn October 2009, Carlisle made his first appearance on the BBC television football programme Match of the Day 2.[3] He has since appeared as a pundit for Sky Sports and ITV Sport during numerous televised football matches.[89][90] Carlisle has made two appearances on the BBC panel debate show Question Time, becoming the first footballer to appear on the programme.[91][92] In July 2012, he presented a documentary on BBC Three titled Is Football Racist?, in which he interviewed former footballers Stan Collymore, Chris Hughton and John Barnes about their experiences of racism during their careers, as well as investigating the history of racism in English football on the pitch and in the stands.[93] He also presented a second documentary for BBC Three, Football's Suicide Secret, on the issue of mental health in football on 9 July 2013.[94] He published his autobiography, You Don't Know Me, But... A Footballer's Life in 2013.[95]\n\nFrom an early age, Carlisle was encouraged to follow Christianity by his parents. He adopted those beliefs, and became a regular churchgoer during his time at Watford.[3] Carlisle was married to Gemma, whom he met just prior to his admission to the Sporting Chance clinic. The couple married on the island of Antigua, where some of Carlisle's family also resides. The couple lived in Ripponden, West Yorkshire with their son, Marley, who was born in 2007, and daughter Honey, born 2010.[3] Carlisle also has a daughter named Francesca, born in 1999, from a previous relationship.[3] He is close friends with Adebayo Akinfenwa, his former teammate at Northampton.[96]\n\nOn 30 January 2002, Carlisle was awarded the accolade of \"Britain's Brainiest Footballer\" in a television quiz.[97][98] Carlisle appeared as a contestant on the Channel 4 game show Countdown on 24 February 2010, winning his first match against the defending champion to stay on the show for the following programme.[99] Carlisle then won his second contest, achieving a larger score than the previous day to stay on for another match. In his third match on 26 February 2010, he was defeated by three points.[100] He was banned from driving for one year and eight months and fined \u00a32,365 after pleading guilty of drink driving at Bury Magistrates Court on 11 October 2011.[101]\n\nOn the morning of 22 December 2014, Carlisle was hit by a lorry on the A64 near Bishopthorpe, North Yorkshire, and was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary[102] having suffered cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee.[103] He had surgery soon after and his wife reported that he was \"very poorly\" but \"alive and stable\".[104] Burnley and Liverpool supporters performed a minute's applause in support of Carlisle starting in the fifth minute of their match on 26 December 2014, in reference to Carlisle wearing the number five shirt for Burnley.[105] On 30 December 2014, it was announced that Carlisle was charged with a drink-driving offence on 20 December 2014.[106] He appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on 20 January 2015.[106] In February 2015, after leaving hospital, Carlisle said that he had been trying to kill himself when he was hit by the lorry in December 2014.[107]\n\nCarlisle and his wife Gemma separated in early 2015 over his depression and recent suicide attempt.[103] On 14 May 2015, Clarke was banned from driving for three years, ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work and pay \u00a3145 in costs.[108]\n\nOn 15 September 2017, Carlisle was reported missing, having last been seen earlier that day in Manchester city centre.[109] That evening, Preston police reported that he had been found safe in Liverpool.[110] He later explained that he was intent on taking his own life that day and was deciding how to do so. Some nearby people intervened and kept him from hurting himself.[98][111]\n\nQueens Park Rangers\n\nBurnley\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_Carlisle"}, {"id": 132, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/42/825441/original/david-norris-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "David Norris", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/david-norris/825441", "desc": "David Martin Norris (born 22 February 1981) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Lancaster City.

Born in Stamford, he has played in the Football League for Hull City, Plymouth Argyle, Ipswich Town, Portsmouth, Leeds United, Peterborough United, Yeovil Town and Blackpool. Norris has made more than 400 Football League appearances.\n\nHaving started his career at Southern League Midland Division club Stamford, Norris joined Boston United in 1999,[5] who were playing one league higher at the time.[6] He scored ten goals in 26 league appearances in his first season and one more in five cup matches.[5] Boston won promotion to the Football Conference that season as Southern League Premier Division champions.[7] Norris was transferred to First Division club Bolton Wanderers for a fee in excess of \u00a350,000 in January 2000, which was a record transfer fee received by Boston at the time.[5] He returned to Boston on loan in December and scored four goals in five league appearances.[5] In March 2002, Norris joined Football League Third Division club Hull City on loan, where he played in six matches and scored once. In two-and-a-half years with Bolton, he made one appearance in the FA Cup and four in the League Cup.\n\nNorris initially joined Football League Second Division club Plymouth Argyle on loan for a month in October 2002.[8] He scored the decisive goal on his debut in a 1\u20130 win at Crewe Alexandra,[9] and made seven league appearances before joining the club permanently for an undisclosed fee in December.[10][11] Argyle won promotion to the EFL Championship as Second Division champions in 2004 with Norris scoring five goals in 45 league appearances that season.[10] He won the club's Player of the Year award in 2006 and, after more than five years at the club, Norris had made 243 appearances in all competitions, scoring 28 goals.[10]\n\nIn the January 2008 transfer window Ipswich Town had two bids rejected by the Plymouth board despite Norris handing in a transfer request. Ipswich lodged one final, increased bid which was finally accepted after brokering a deal with Bolton that would allow Plymouth to receive more than the 50% Norris' clause initially gave them. Norris finally signed for Ipswich Town on 31 January 2008 for an undisclosed fee, signing a contract until 2011. He scored his first goal for the club in the 1\u20131 draw with Southampton away from home.\n\nIn November 2008, Norris was heavily criticised for a controversial goal celebration against Blackpool, interpreted as a show of support for jailed friend and former Plymouth goalkeeper Luke McCormick.[12] McCormick was returning from Norris' wedding in June 2008 when he fell asleep at the wheel due to the effects of alcohol and caused the deaths of two young boys.[12] He was sentenced to seven years and four months prison time in October of that year.[13]\n\nThe family of the bereaved took offence at Norris' gesture and he was subsequently fined and warned by Ipswich.[14] He was once again caught out when he told the Ipswich website[15] he had not intended the celebration as a show of support to Luke McCormick and the statement was later changed by the club, adding further to the controversy. The statement now reads that the celebration was in fact a message to Luke McCormick. Later that week it was revealed that Norris was fined \u00a325,000 by Ipswich and would make a face-to-face apology to Phil and Amanda Peak (the parents of the two boys).[16]\n\nEventually, In August 2010, Norris became the Ipswich Town captain.[17] Norris was handed the captain's armband by Manager Roy Keane after the departure of the then captain Jonathan Walters to Stoke City.[18] In the summer of 2011 Norris turned down a new contract extension at Ipswich Town, with the club only prepared to offer him a two-year extension, a year short of the midfielders demands, with rival Championship club Leeds United heavily linked with signing him on a free transfer.[19]\n\nOn 15 June 2011, Norris signed for Portsmouth on a free transfer after turning down a new two-year deal with Ipswich.[20] On 6 August, in his debut league appearance for Portsmouth, he scored against Middlesbrough in a game which ended 2\u20132.[21] He scored his second goal for Portsmouth in a match away at West Ham United, which ended 4\u20133 to the home team. At first it was believed that Benjani Mwaruwari had scored the goal, but replays later showed that Norris had already put the ball over the line when Benjani headed in the rebound.[22]\n\nHis first goal at Fratton Park came in a 2\u20130 home victory against Barnsley. With the match goalless, Karim Rekik headed the ball down to Norris, who controlled and then volleyed it into the net from the edge of the penalty area.[23] On 7 April 2012, Norris scored a spectacular equalising goal against arch-rivals Southampton in the 93rd minute to secure Portsmouth a point.\n\nIn July 2012, Norris agreed the deal to join Leeds United from Portsmouth, to join his former teammates Jason Pearce, Luke Varney and Jamie Ashdown.[24] Norris was allocated the number 19 shirt for the 2012\u201313 season on 3 August.[25]\n\nNorris made his competitive d\u00e9but for Leeds in the first game of the season against Shrewsbury Town in the League Cup on 11 August. Norris was also named the Leeds United captain for the match and also scored his first goal in the same game.[26] Norris made his league d\u00e9but for Leeds in their 1\u20130 victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers.[27] On 7 September, Norris was ruled out for a month after picking up a thigh injury,[28] as a result of the injury, Leeds signed Michael Tonge on loan to help cover his absence.[29] Norris made his first start since returning from injury against Charlton Athletic on 23 October, in the same game Norris scored his second goal of the season which was his first league goal for Leeds.[30] Norris scored his third goal of the season for Leeds against Huddersfield Town to help earn Leeds a 4\u20132 victory on 1 December.[31]\n\nNorris missed the final three games of the season under new manager Brian McDermott due to a knee injury that required surgery,[32] and on 15 August 2013, with Leeds needing to raise finances to help fund signings, he was made available for transfer alongside teammates El Hadji Diouf and Adam Drury.[33]\n\nNorris was out of favour throughout the 2013\u20132014 season under McDermott, making only one appearance in the League Cup.[34] He featured in the development squad,[35] but was also hampered by another knee injury that kept him out over the winter period.[36][37][38]\n\nNorris made his first appearance for Leeds in over a year in the last game of Head Coach Dave Hockaday against Bradford City in the League Cup, providing an assist for striker Matt Smith who opened the scoring in a 2\u20131 defeat on 27 August 2014.[39]\n\nHe was finally released by Leeds United on 2 February 2015, when his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.[40]\n\nNorris joined League One side Peterborough United on a short-term contract on 13 February 2015, until the end of the 2014\u201315 season. He was allocated the number 23 shirt for the club.\n\nOn 21 August 2015, Norris signed for League Two side Yeovil Town on non-contract terms, linking up with his former Plymouth manager Paul Sturrock.[41] He made his only appearance in the 2\u20130 defeat against Oxford United, on 29 August 2015, and left the club on 1 September 2015.[42]\n\nNorris joined Blackpool on 3 September 2015, on a contract until the end of the season.[43] He scored his first and only goal for Blackpool in a 5\u20130 win over Scunthorpe United on 16 January 2016.[44]\n\nIn September 2016 he signed for non-league Leatherhead.[45]\n\nIn February 2017 he signed for non-league Salford City.[46]\n\nIn August 2017, Norris joined Shaw Lane.[47]\n\nIn September 2018, 18 years after initially leaving the club, Norris returned to Boston United.[48]\n\nIn December 2018 Norris signed for Northern Premier League club Lancaster City. His first appearance was on 1 December at North Ferriby United, but North Ferriby left the league, with their record expunged in March 2019, so Norris's debut in real terms was the following week, when he appeared as a substitute in a home game against Gainsborough Trinity.\n\nNorris qualifies to play for the Republic of Ireland, through his mother, who has family in Kildare. Though he has never been selected to play for them, he was contacted by Steve Staunton (Ireland's former manager) about playing.[49]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Norris_(footballer)"}, {"id": 133, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/98/1950679/original/r-rik-g-slason-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "R\u00farik G\u00edslason", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/r\u00farik-g\u00edslason/1950679", "desc": "R\u00farik G\u00edslason (born 25 February 1988) is an Icelandic footballer who plays as a midfielder for SV Sandhausen.", "full_desc": "\n\nR\u00farik G\u00edslason (born 25 February 1988) is an Icelandic former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.\n\nR\u00farik started his career with HK K\u00f3pavogur in his youth.

He also played in Australia for Sydney United, Central Coast Mariners and Sydney Olympic, as well as representing Australia 17 times during his career, scoring one goal for his nation. He was a co-host of Bill & Boz on Fox Sports News.\n\nManchester United brought Bosnich to England in 1989, but a lack of first-team opportunities and a failed attempt to secure a work visa, saw him return to Australia. A year later, Aston Villa brought him back to England and he established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League during the 1990s. Manchester United re-signed him in 1999 as a replacement for the departing Peter Schmeichel, but injuries and a lack of first-team opportunities led to a decline in form. He left Manchester United for Chelsea in 2001, where he again struggled to find a regular place in the starting line-up and continued to battle with injuries. In September 2002, he was released by Chelsea and banned from football for nine months after testing positive for cocaine.\n\nBosnich subsequently developed an addiction to the drug and spent the next six years of his life in exile, before training for a comeback in 2007 and eventually making a return to the professional game in his native Australia the following year, before retiring in 2009.\n\nBosnich was born and raised in Liverpool, New South Wales. His Croatian father was born in Blato, Kor\u010dula, Croatia and migrated to Sydney in 1959. He attended Casula Primary School and later Liverpool Boys High School.[citation needed] Bosnich played for Sydney Croatia youth team before moving to England. In 1989, at the age of 17, he joined Manchester United on a non-contract basis and made his debut for them in a First Division fixture against Wimbledon on 30 April 1990.\n\nHe only played two more games for Manchester United before his registration with the club was cancelled on 30 June 1991. Bosnich had been in England using a student visa and when this expired in July 1991, he then returned to Sydney Croatia briefly in the 1991\u201392 season.[3] He returned to England signing for Aston Villa on a free transfer on 28 February 1992.\n\nBosnich did not claim a regular place in the Aston Villa first team until the 1993\u201394 season. In the League Cup semi-final against Tranmere Rovers that season, he dramatically stopped three shots in a penalty shoot-out.[citation needed] Villa won the final, against his former club, Manchester United. In March 1994 Bosnich saved two penalties against Tottenham Hotspur, one from Darren Anderton and one from Nick Barmby, to help secure a 1\u20131 draw. These were his fourth and fifth penalty saves from open play that season.[4] 1994\u201395 was Bosnich's first full season as Villa's first-choice goalkeeper, but it was a disappointing season for the club as they narrowly avoided relegation.\n\nBosnich was one of the few players to be retained by new manager Brian Little following Atkinson's dismissal in November 1994, as the bulk of Atkinson's team was sold off to make way for a new side. 1995\u201396 was perhaps the best season of Bosnich's career. He was now widely acclaimed as one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League, as he helped Villa finish fourth in the league and win the Football League Cup final at Wembley with a 3\u20130 triumph over Leeds United.\n\nIn 1996, Bosnich was fined \u00a31,000 and censured by the FA after he was found guilty of misconduct by upsetting fans of Tottenham Hotspur (a club with a large Jewish following) with a Nazi salute.[5] Bosnich spent three more seasons at Villa Park before his contract expired and he joined Manchester United on a free transfer. He had played 207 times in seven-and-a-half years with Villa.\n\nBosnich was signed for Manchester United in the 1999 close season as successor to Peter Schmeichel, signing on a free transfer after his contract at Villa Park expired. During the season, he picked up a Premier League title medal as United were crowned champions by an 18-point margin. That season Bosnich started 23 league games, Raimond van der Gouw started 11 and Massimo Taibi started 4. Highlights of this season were saving two penalties in January 2000; one from Necaxa's \u00c1lex Aguinaga in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship to secure a 1\u20131 draw, and the other from Middlesbrough's Juninho to help secure a 1\u20130 win.[6][7] He also played a key role in Manchester United becoming the first English team to win the Intercontinental Cup in keeping a clean sheet against Palmeiras of Brazil, in Tokyo.[8]\n\nHe had one season as United's regular goalkeeper, but then they signed the French World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez in June 2000. Soon after, Bosnich found himself as third-choice goalkeeper. Newly appointed Celtic manager Martin O'Neill made an offer to loan Bosnich for the 2000\u201301 season, but he decided against the move and decided that he would try to regain his place in the Manchester United first team. He had also fallen out of favour with the national side, losing his spot to Mark Schwarzer. With hopes of a first-team return fading, Bosnich was linked with Chelsea.[9]\n\nIn Alex Ferguson's autobiography released in 2013, he called Bosnich a \"terrible professional\". Bosnich responded to Ferguson, saying, \"The fact remains that I was the only player he signed twice at Manchester United. I'm honoured to be mentioned. He's entitled to his view and I'm entitled to mine.\"[10]\n\nBosnich never played a first-team game for United after the arrival of Fabien Barthez, and on 18 January 2001 he signed for Chelsea on a free transfer.[11] Problems with his fitness and injury meant his debut did not happen until the following season in a UEFA Cup tie against Hapoel Tel Aviv.[12] Bosnich was earning A$130,000-a-week (approximately \u00a345,500-a-week) at Chelsea.[13] He was injured in a league game against Everton in November 2001 and this proved to be his final appearance for the club.[14] His career reached rock-bottom in September 2002 when he failed a drugs test and was subsequently sacked by Chelsea and banned from football for nine months.[15]\n\nThe suspension scuppered a move to Bolton Wanderers in the newly introduced winter transfer window. Bosnich was keen on the idea of moving to the Reebok Stadium and the player's agent admitted that dialogue had taken place but Sam Allardyce remained coy about his interest. In the autumn of 2004, Bosnich spurned an opportunity to return to football with League One side, Walsall, who were then managed by Paul Merson, who had played alongside Bosnich in his final season at Aston Villa.[citation needed]\n\nBosnich developed a $5,000-a-week cocaine addiction and became a recluse.[16][17] Bosnich took up to 10\u00a0g (0.35\u00a0oz) of cocaine a day. At one stage, he almost shot his father with an air rifle, thinking it was an intruder in his home. His father convinced him to quit the drug.[16][18] In early 2007, former Chelsea teammate and QPR goalkeeping coach Ed de Goey gave him inspiration to come out of retirement. By July 2007, Bosnich started training at Queens Park Rangers' training ground in an attempt to initially get fit, with the view to play professionally again.[19] During the summer he lost 15\u00a0kg (33\u00a0lb) and claimed to have regained most of his reflexes. In September he kept a clean sheet in goal during a friendly behind closed doors against Barnet, which QPR won 2\u20130.[20]\n\nBosnich returned to Australia in 2008 after many years living in London.[21] Bosnich was confirmed to be the starting goalkeeper for the Central Coast Mariners for their pre-season cup game against Sydney FC on 27 July 2008.[22] Bosnich kept a clean sheet including saving a penalty by Sydney FC's Steve Corica before being substituted in the 80th minute to a standing ovation by both sets of supporters. On 19 August 2008, Bosnich signed a seven-week guest player deal with the Mariners.[23]\n\nBosnich made his A-League debut with the Central Coast Mariners on 31 August 2008 in a 4\u20132 away win against the Queensland Roar at the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. Once Mariners first-choice goalkeeper Danny Vukovic had served his suspension, Bosnich did not play again for the Mariners. On 31 May 2009, it was announced that Bosnich had signed to play for Sydney Olympic for the remainder of the NSW Premier League season.[24][25]\n\nBosnich suffered a hamstring injury and he ended his playing career to focus on his television commitments.[26] On 22 October 2010, it was confirmed Bosnich would temporarily join the North Queensland Fury as an interim coach for the fixture against Newcastle Jets, in the absence of Franz Straka and Stuart McLaren, who had been banned from the touchline for two games.[27] However, Bosnich was not allowed by the FFA because he did not have a coaching license.\n\nHis first appearance with the Australia national team came in 1990 against touring USSR club side Torpedo, followed by a number of further appearances in 'unofficial' Socceroos matches in the next few years. His first full international appearance came in 1993 against New Zealand in a qualifying match for the 1994 World Cup. Bosnich also appeared for the Socceroos at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\nAlthough his international appearances with the Socceroos were rare, they were memorable occasions. Keeping for Australia in the away leg of its home-and-away qualifier with Iran in a failed attempt to qualify for the 1998 World Cup, Australia losing on away goals in what Bosnich described as \"the lowest moment in Australian football\". Bosnich also scored a late penalty for his national team in a 13\u20130 win over the Solomon Islands. In November 2007 he admitted that he was hopeful of selection for Australia to make up for the times he shunned it in favour of his club commitments. \"If I ever get the chance to play for Australia again, I will never make the mistake of saying 'no'.\"[28]\n\nBosnich married for the first time in 1992, to an English woman named Lisa Hall. The wedding took place in Sydney, New South Wales, in February. It was rumoured that he married Hall to be able to return to Britain, after problems with his working visa. After two years of marriage, Home Office officials were satisfied it was not a wedding of convenience and Bosnich was allowed to remain indefinitely in Britain. However, the marriage ended just three months later. According to him, \"We were in love but our marriage just didn't work out.\"[29] His second marriage was to Sarah Jarrett, in 1999. He almost failed to reach the altar, having only been released on bail hours before the wedding following an incident at a strip club during his stag night celebrations.[30]\n\nThe marriage lasted only 14 months. Jarrett was pregnant at the time of the divorce, but she lost the baby soon afterwards, in the third month of pregnancy.[31] Bosnich said that much of his cocaine problem was due to his relationship with British model Sophie Anderton, claiming that for every line of cocaine she had, he had to have one too. He does not regret his actions however, crediting them with being able to help someone in need.[32] His addiction worsened and he later said, \"There was a stage where I got up to 10 grams a day when I was really down in the dumps.\" On 16 July 2008, he was made bankrupt at the High Court in London on the petition of a creditor.[33]\n\nBosnich provided special comments for the Socceroos' friendly with Nigeria on 17 November alongside Simon Hill on Australia's Fox Sports and subsequently on SBS's coverage of the 2008 FA Cup final. Bosnich is now a football analyst and commentator for Fox Sports football programmes. As part of this role, he co-hosted Bill & Boz which has since been cancelled. In 2021, Bosnich joined Stan Sport to cover the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League competitions.[citation needed] He also works as a player agent. Bosnich trains at Kostya Tszyu's Boxing Academy in Rockdale.[34] Bosnich lived with his parents in Fairfield when he returned to Australia and now lives in Woolloomooloo with his partner Sarah Jones.[35][36]\n\nAston Villa\n\nManchester United\n\nAustralia\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bosnich"}, {"id": 135, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/99/1965466/original/salvador-caba_as-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Salvador Caba\u00f1as", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/salvador-caba\u00f1as/1965466", "desc": "Salvador Caba\u00f1as Ortega (born 5 August 1980) is a Paraguayan former football striker.\nCaba\u00f1as played for Club 12 de Octubre, Guaran\u00ed, Audax Italiano, Chiapas, Club Am\u00e9rica, General Caballero, Tanabi Esporte Clube and Independiente F.B.C..

He gave his first interview on 12 March 2010 in appreciation to all the people who prayed for him.

He was the captain of the Nigerian national team until his international football retirement in June 2014, and was Nigeria's record appearance holder. In February 2020, he was appointed assistant coach of the Super Eagles by the Nigeria Football Federation.[5]\n\nYobo's birthplace and origin is Kono, an Ogoni community in Khana Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria.[6]\n\nYobo left Nigeria to join Standard Li\u00e8ge in 1998. He made his first team debut in 2000, and went on to appear 46 times. In 2001, he was bought by Marseille.[7]\n\nSoon after making his debut, Yobo was loaned to Tenerife. After around nine months, Yobo returned to Marseille, before joining Everton, again on loan, in July 2002. A \u00a31 million fee was required to register the player, and he became the first signing of David Moyes.[8] An option to make the move permanent was taken up and completed in 2003 after a dispute between Yobo and Marseille was settled,[9] with Everton agreeing a fixed additional fee of \u00a34 million.[3][10]\n\nYobo became one of the most consistent players in the Everton squad, and was one of only seven players in the entire league to play every minute of every game throughout the 2006\u201307 season; his teammate Joleon Lescott also being an ever-present throughout the season.\n\nThe delay, in 2006, in signing a new contract with Everton lead to rumours of a move to Arsenal,[11] but on 22 July, Yobo committed himself to Goodison Park until 2010. On 15 April 2007, Yobo became the record appearance holder for an overseas player at Everton, a record he held until early 2012.[12] For the UEFA Cup match against Larissa of Greece on 25 October 2007, Yobo was named as captain in the absence of Phil Neville and thus became the first African to captain the club. On 6 May 2009, Yobo scored his first goal of the season against West Ham United to seal a 3\u20131 win.\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Yobo had to adjust to his new defensive partner, Sylvain Distin, after Joleon Lescott left and Phil Jagielka became injured. On 29 November 2009, he scored an own goal in Everton's 2\u20130 defeat to Liverpool in the Merseyside derby. Distin, Jagielka and John Heitinga were increasingly selected over Yobo, confining him to the bench.\n\nOn 31 August 2010, Yobo signed a one-year loan contract with Fenerbah\u00e7e. Yobo played in 30 official matches and scored a goal, helping his team win the league title. On 6 September 2011, Fenerbah\u00e7e and Everton agreed on another loan deal for \u20ac700,000 and Yobo signed a one-year contract worth \u20ac2.35 million.[13] On 4 August 2012, he re-signed for Fenerbah\u00e7e once again, but this time on a permanent basis on a 3-year contract, after having played for Everton for 10 years. On 17 August Fenerbah\u00e7e played against Torku Konyaspor and Yobo scored a goal in this match.[14] Before the 2014\u20132015 season his contract with Fenerbah\u00e7e was terminated with mutual agreement.[15] On 31 August 2014 was awarded with the plaque of appreciation and have been released from Fenerbah\u00e7e.[16]\n\nOn 30 January 2014, Yobo returned to England on loan at Norwich City for the remainder of the season with a view to a permanent move in the summer.[17]\n\nHe marked his debut for the club with a clean sheet against top-scoring club Manchester City on 8 February.[18]\n\nYobo is a former Nigeria international, who has been capped 101 times and represented the Super Eagles at three FIFA World Cups and six Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.[19]\n\nAfter participating in Nigeria's run to the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship quarter-finals, Yobo made his senior international debut against Zambia in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 24 March 2001.[19] He played in all six of the team's matches in the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations[20] and was included in the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he was again ever-present,[20] assisting Julius Aghahowa's goal in a 2\u20131 loss to Sweden.[21]\n\nYobo made his second World Cup appearance at the 2010 tournament in South Africa, after which he assumed the captaincy on the international retirement of Nwankwo Kanu.[19] The veteran defender was no longer a first choice player at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, but lifted the trophy after appearing as an 89th-minute substitute in Nigeria's 1\u20130 final defeat of Burkina Faso.[22]\n\nIn June 2014, Yobo was included in Stephen Keshi's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[23] He was named in the starting line-up for both the second and third group matches, helping the Super Eagles to clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[24] On 30 June, he made his 100th international appearance, captaining Nigeria against France in the round of 16. After scoring an own goal in the 2\u20130 defeat, Yobo announced his international retirement, saying: \"This is it. I can look back on my career with great pride. I wanted to leave on a high for my country. Defeat by France was not the right way to go but I'm happy with all I've done for the national team. It's time to give a chance to other people to come through.\"[25]\n\nOn 12 February 2020, Yobo was appointed assistant coach of the Super Eagles by the Nigeria Football Federation after a brief meeting held in Abuja.[26] He was appointed assistant coach to replace Imama Amapakabo.[27][28][29]\n\nYobo said \"I am bringing back that motivation. As a former captain, I'm bringing inspiration. I've been there and I've done it all. I was a fan of the team before I became an assistant coach, so I've seen from a fanatical point of view how people feel when they are watching the team. We as players, while playing, don't notice these things but after my retirement, I've been a pundit, I've given my opinion about what should be done in the team.\" He also said \"I'm bringing back my experience. Having over 15 years of consistency in my career, I think this is a lot. The good thing is that the spirit is going to improve. Having been a pundit and looking at the team, I think we can go a lot higher with the quality we have\".[30]\n\nIn 2010, following a brief courtship, Yobo married former MBGN Adaeze Igwe in a midnight ceremony held in Jos. The couple wedded in a very low key ceremony barely three months after they met in December 2009.[31] However, it is known that they are said to be trying to hide their marital troubles from the press and general public.[32] The couple welcomed a baby boy named Joey Yobo April 2010.\n\nHe is the younger brother of former Nigeria international Albert Yobo. In July 2008, his younger brother Norum[33] was kidnapped in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria and held for ransom. He was eventually released after 12 days on 17 July 2008.[34]\n\nIt was widely reported in the Nigerian media that Yobo went to T.B. Joshua for prayers after suffering a hamstring injury in the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations.[35] Yobo and his wife, Adaeze Igwe were conferred with chieftaincy titles of Mene Aborlo 1 and Waamene Aborlo 1 respectively of Ogoniland by King GNK Gininwa of Ogoni Kingdom on Saturday, 28 May 2016. This was a day after his testimonial match marking his exit from active football was organised by the Rivers State Government on Friday, 27 May 2016\n\nIn 2007, Yobo set up the Joseph Yobo Charity Foundation,[36] to help under-privileged children in Nigeria. As of 18 July 2007, he has handed out over 300 scholarship awards ranging from primary to university level. Yobo has started a football academy in the Ogoni region of Nigeria. He also runs football camps in Lagos.\n\nFenerbahce\n\nNigeria\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Yobo"}, {"id": 138, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/567/11323093/original/keirrison-de-souza-carneiro-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Keirrison", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/keirrison-de-souza-carneiro/11323093", "desc": "Keirrison de Souza Carneiro (born 3 December 1988), nicknamed \"K9\", is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a striker, most recently for Londrina.", "full_desc": "\n\nKeirrison de Souza Carneiro (born 3 December 1988),[1] nicknamed \"K9\", is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a striker, most recently for Londrina.\n\nKeirrison became a regular in Coritiba's main squad in 2007,[3] helping the club win the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B and being promoted to the following year's Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A.[4] He was the club's top goalscorer in that competition with 12 goals.[5] He was also the top goalscorer of the Campeonato Paranaense in 2008 with 18 goals.[4] He played his first S\u00e9rie A match on 11 May 2008, when his club beat Palmeiras 2\u20130, although he suffered an injury in the match.[6] He scored his first goal for the club on 9 July 2008 in a 4\u20130 win over Portuguesa. His first goal came less than a month later in a 0\u20130 win over Santos on 3 August 2008. Keirrison finished as the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A 2008's top goalscorer with 23 goals, tied with Washington of Fluminense and Kl\u00e9ber Pereira of Santos, being the youngest top scorer in the history of Brazil.[7]\n\nKeirrison joined Palmeiras in January 2009.[8][9] He made his club debut on 24 January 2009 against Mogi Mirim, scoring twice in the 3\u20130 win.[10] then twice in the preliminary round of the Copa Libertadores as Palmeiras beat Real Potos\u00ed 1\u20131 on 29 January 2010.[11] On 26 June, it said on Palmeiras' official website that Barcelona had made an offer for the striker.\n\nOn 23 July 2009, Barcelona announced on its website it had agreed to terms with Palmeiras to bring Keirrison to the Camp Nou. The transfer was worth \u20ac14\u00a0million plus a bonus up to \u20ac2\u00a0million contingent on the number of matches Keirrison played with the first team. Keirrison signed on a five-year contract.[12] On arrival at the Spanish club, Keirrison expressed his adulation he had for his new club and was quoted as saying in Barcelona's official website, \"I hope to break into [Barcelona head coach] Pep Guardiola's side, and join many other famous Brazilians who have played here.\" He added, \"I always followed Barcelona and the Brazilian players who played here. Now at 20 years old, I am very happy to be here, fulfilling my dream of playing at the best club in the world.\"[13] However, soon after, Guardiola stated \"in principle he'll go out on loan\". Many teams throughout Europe were linked with Keirrison after hearing of Barcelona's plan to loan-out the Brazilian in order to acclimatize him to European football, including Roma,[13] Monaco and Ajax.[14]\n\nIn articles published several years following his arrival at Barcelona, Keirrison was chosen as one of the worst signings in the history of the club.[15][16][17]\n\nOn 28 July 2009, it was announced Portuguese Primeira Liga club Benfica agreed on terms to take the Brazilian on loan for the 2009\u201310 season.[18] Keirrison scored his first goal for Benfica in a friendly against Celtic. However, with the abundance of strikers in form at Benfica, Keirrison found it hard to break into the first team; to some, Keirrison was behind \u00d3scar Cardozo, Nuno Gomes and Javier Saviola in the pecking order at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz.[19] While in Portugal, Keirrison started one match for Benfica and played a total of just 199 minutes. In January 2010, then Benfica manager Jorge Jesus even went as far as to say that he did not plan to play Keirrison for the remainder of the season.[20] Nonetheless, Keirisson became a Portuguese champion thanks to the five league matches he featured in for Primeira Liga winners Benfica.\n\nOn 31 January 2010, Fiorentina announced on its website it had come to terms with Barcelona to take Keirrison on loan until the end of the 2011\u201312 season.[21][22][23] Barcelona also granted La Viola an option to purchase Keirrison outright, after his loan, for \u20ac14\u00a0million.[24] On 7 February 2010, just one week after being signed, Keirrison made his official debut for La Viola after coming on as a substitute for Manuel Pasqual in the 84th minute in a 1\u20130 loss against Roma.[25] On 21 February, Keirrison came on as a substitute for Marco Marchionni in the 76th minute in a match against Livorno; Fiorentina went on to win that match 2\u20131.[26] On 28 February, he replaced Adem Ljaji\u0107 in the 46th minute against Lazio and he later went on to score the equalizer in the 92nd minute, his first goal for Fiorentina.[27]\n\nOn 10 July 2010, Keirrison's loan with Fiorentina was terminated prematurely,[28] and on 12 July, he was loaned by Barcelona to Brazilian side Santos.[29]\n\nWith Santos, Keirrison won the 2011 Copa Libertadores, but as a reserve. In August 2011, he was loaned to Cruzeiro until the end of the 2011 Brazilian season.[30]\n\nIn March 2012, Keirrison was loaned to his original club, Coritiba, until the end of the 2013\u201314 season.[31]\n\nOn 7 March 2014, Keirrison agreed a free transfer with Coritiba which was validated on 1 July, after his contract with Barcelona terminated.[32]\n\nIn September 2015, Keirrison went to court against Coritiba requesting unpaid wages and medical expenses from a surgery to recover from an injury.[33] In November, after the club claimed to have paid the debt, Keirrison said he would not play in the next match against Figueirense, claiming he \"would not be ready\".[34] One director told the reason might be that \"he [Keirrison] checked his bank account and the money was not there yet\", thus deciding not to play.[35] He was released after the 2015 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, Keirrison flew to Thailand to sign for Buriram United,[36] however both sides could not agree on a deal and the transfer deal fell through.[37]\n\nKeirrison scored eight goals in 24 starts for Londrina in 2016 before returning to Coritiba, via Arouca in Portugal, only to sign for  Londrina on a 2-year contract in January 2018 to compete in the Campeonato Paranaense, S\u00e9rie B and Copa do Brasil.[38]\n\nOn 3 February 2018 he got his first goal since returning with the equaliser in the Alviceleste's match with Cianorte in the Caf\u00e9 Stadium that finished 1-1.[39]\n\nKeirrison was born in Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, the son of Oper\u00e1rio (MS) footballer Adir Carneiro and Alzira Rosa de Souza. His name was chosen by his father as a tribute to rock musicians Jim Morrison from The Doors and Keith Richards from The Rolling Stones, and also an admiration for the letter K.[3] Keirrison and his father bought a football club from Campo Grande, the capital of Mato Grosso do Sul in April 2008, and renamed it to Centro de Futebol Keirrison, shortened as CFK9.[40]\n\nKeirrison is married to Hevelin Buss, sister of former teammate and Brazilian international Henrique.[41] In November 2015, their two-year-old son died after a respiratory failure.[42]\n\nStatistics correct as of 26 January 2017[43]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirrison"}, {"id": 139, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/41/807145/original/damir-kahriman-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Damir Kahriman", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/damir-kahriman/807145", "desc": "Damir Kahriman (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0414\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041a\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d; born 19 November 1984) is a Serbian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Iraklis in the Greek Football League.\nHe was a member of the Serbia national under-21 football team, especially during the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands in which Serbia reached the final and the keeper was selected for the tournament's starting eleven.", "full_desc": "Damir Kahriman (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0414\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041a\u0430\u0445\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d; born 19 November 1984) is a Serbian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper.\n\nHe was a member of the Serbia national under-21 football team, especially during the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands in which Serbia reached the final and the keeper was selected for the tournament's starting eleven.\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damir_Kahriman"}, {"id": 140, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/51/1015807/original/francis-lee-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Francis Lee", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/francis-lee/1015807", "desc": "Francis Henry Lee  (born 29 April 1944 in Westhoughton, Lancashire, England), also known as Franny Lee, is a former professional footballer.\nLee played for Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Derby County and England.

He has worked for both Sky Sports in England and TV3 and Today FM in Ireland. He was a winning participant in the fourth season of the Celebrity Bainisteoir reality television series.\n\nCascarino was born in St Paul's Cray in South-East London on 1 September 1962 to an Italian father and an English mother. Prior to his professional football career he worked as a hairdresser and labourer.[2]\n\nCascarino joined Gillingham in 1982 from Crockenhill, and according to Cascarino Gillingham donated tracksuits and training equipment to Crockenhill in lieu of a transfer fee.[4] He made his professional debut on 2 February 1982 in a 1\u20130 away league defeat to Burnley. His first goal for the Kent side came in his home debut on 13 February 1982 against Wimbledon, scoring the last goal in a 6\u20131 win having replaced an injured Dean White as substitute. Cascarino would later reveal that having not expected to be named in the matchday squad, he had consumed a \"double Wimpey and chips and a Knickerbocker Glory\" just before kick-off.[5]\n\nWhile with the Kent side he scored 110 goals in all competitions,[2] and was named in the PFA Third Division Team of the Year for three successive seasons.[6]\n\nHe went on to play for Millwall - the club he supported as a boy. Millwall had missed an opportunity to sign Cascarino as a youngster and subsequently paid the Gills \u00a3225,000 to secure his services.[7]\n\nCascarino signed for Aston Villa for \u00a31.1m in March 1990, then a record transfer fee for the club.[8] His time with the Birmingham club was an unhappy one, and in July 1991 he signed for Celtic for a \u00a31.1m fee, which was also a club record. In joining Celtic he was managed by his former agent and Ireland team mate Liam Brady.[9]\n\nAfter failing to establish himself with the Glasgow side Cascarino returned to England in February 1992 to sign for Chelsea in a swap deal involving Tom Boyd. Cascarino scored on his debut three days later, a 1\u20131 league draw at home to Crystal Palace. However, his time with the side was beset by injuries, with him registering only 8 goals over 40 league appearances in two years.[10]\n\nCascarino signed for Marseille as a free agent in 1994. He ended as top scorer in the 1994\u201395 Ligue 2 season with 31 goals as the club won the league title but were prevented from promotion to Ligue 1 due to an ongoing investigation into financial irregularities and match-fixing scandals involving then-president Bernard Tapie. Cascarino, nicknamed \"Tony Goal\" by the Marseille Ultras,[11] repeated the feat the following season, scoring 30 goals as the club were promoted back to Ligue 1. \n\nIn December 1996 he signed for fellow Ligue 1 side Nancy, scoring a hat-trick in his second appearance, a 1\u20133 away win at Le Havre.[12] The side were relegated to Ligue 2, but Cascarino would win the title and promotion in his first full season with the club the next year. Cascarino holds the Ligue 1 record for oldest player to score a hat-trick, which he did while playing for Nancy in a 3\u20130 win over Stade Rennais at age 37 years and 31 days.[13][14] In May 2000 he was awarded the Medaille d'Or by the city of Nancy in recognition of his contribution to the side.[15]\n\nCascarino ended his career with Red Star 93 in the third tier of French football, but terminated his contract with the club in August 2000 after just two appearances. He was offered a contract to return to Nancy but refused.[16]\n\nCascarino, who was born in England, represented the Republic of Ireland\u2014qualifying through his adoptive Irish grandfather, Michael O'Malley, who was from Westport, County Mayo. He was also eligible to play for both Scotland and Italy because of his Scottish and Italian descent.[17][18][19]\n\nHe made his international debut against Switzerland in September 1985, during Ireland's ill-fated qualification campaign for the 1986 World Cup.[20] Cascarino would go on to feature for Ireland in three major tournaments: Euro 1988, the 1990 World Cup and the 1994 World Cup.[21]\n\nHis last international game came against Turkey in late 1999, as Ireland failed to reach UEFA Euro 2000. He got into a brawl with a Turkish defender and left the pitch showing the scars of battle. This marked the end of an international career which had spanned 14 years at the highest level.[22]\n\nIn October 2000, Cascarino was the subject of national newspaper headlines when extracts from his upcoming autobiography were published in the Sunday Mirror.[23] \nIn it, he revealed that his mother told him in 1996 that she was adopted and therefore wasn't a blood relative to his Irish grandfather. Cascarino said in his autobiography: \"I didn't qualify for Ireland. I was a fraud. A fake Irishman\". The FAI's Chief Executive Bernard O'Byrne stated that he was shocked by the announcement and Cascarino's former international manager Jack Charlton questioned why he came forward with the information. Cascarino revealed that Republic of Ireland teammate Andy Townsend had advised him to keep quiet about the situation.[23]\n\nFour days after the newspaper exclusive, in November 2000, the Football Association of Ireland issued a short statement: \"The FAI are satisfied that Tony Cascarino was always eligible to become a citizen of the Republic of Ireland and was, therefore, always eligible to play for Ireland.\"[24] The Irish Independent reported that Cascarino was given a 'passport of restricted validity' in 1985 and that his mother's name, Theresa O'Malley, was in fact entered in the Foreign Births Register in the Department of Foreign Affairs prior to Cascarino's international debut for the Republic of Ireland.[25][26]\n\nSince retiring from football, Cascarino has become a semi-professional poker player, having appeared in the television series Celebrity Poker Club and commentating on the PartyPoker Poker Den. He has become something of a cult figure and was referenced in the song \"All Your Kayfabe Friends\" by Welsh band Los Campesinos! where the singer tells that \"You asked if I'd be anyone from history / Fact or fiction, dead or alive / I said I'd be Tony Cascarino, circa 1995.\"[27]\n\nCascarino joined talkSPORT as a pundit in 2002 and presented the afternoon Drive Time show with Patrick Kinghorn between 2003-2005. He was involved in an on-air bust-up with Kinghorn after the latter remarked that the married Cascarino had been \"chasing that 21-year-old around the office\", which prompted Cascarino to lunge at Kinghorn and punch him. The pair had to be pulled apart by production staff.[28] Cascarino left the station in 2005 but soon returned as a pundit and has co-presented the Weekend Sports Breakfast since 2016.[29]\n\nIn 2011, he was a winning participant in the Celebrity Bainisteoir reality series. Managing Killeshin GAA Club of County Laois, Cascarino's club won the season 4 competition,[30] beating Paul Gogarty's Oughterard team after extra-time in the final.[31][32]\n\nCascarino entered into a relationship with his third wife, Jo, in 2009 and their son, Rocco, was born in 2015; they married in Mauritius in November 2019.[33]\n\nThe twin France women's national football team players Delphine and Estelle Cascarino are not related to Tony Cascarino, although they are often asked if they are:[34] \"I am often asked if I am from his family, that is not the case... I know that he notably played for Nancy and that he is Irish. Me, I'm not Irish at all! (laughs)\"[35]\n\nOn 9th September 2022, it was reported that Tony Cascarino had thrown a Chinese takeaway into a rubbish bin, as a mark of respect, upon hearing the news of the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The news went viral, before being debunked by various media outlets as a joke originating on Twitter.[36][37]\n\nCascarino produced an autobiography in 2000, Full Time: The Secret Life of Tony Cascarino,[38] which received great critical acclaim.[39]\n\nThe book detailed his love of gambling, particularly playing all forms of poker, and revealed that his career had been blighted by crippling self-doubt, which he summarised as the \"little voice\".[40] The book also candidly refers to his shame over his infidelities[41] and of leaving his wife, Sarah and two sons, Michael and Teddy (who was named after Cascarino's former Millwall teammate Teddy Sheringham) and muses: \"...maybe, just maybe, I was so wrapped up in my newfound celebrity that I'd become immune to the suffering I was causing\".\n\nHe also revealed that during his time at Marseille, he and many other of the club's players were injected by club president Bernard Tapie's personal physician with an unknown substance. The physiotherapist at the time insisted the substance was legal and would provide an \"adrenaline boost\". Cascarino claimed that most players accepted the injections[42] and that \"it definitely made a difference: I felt sharper, more energetic, hungrier for the ball\".

As a player he played for the Port Adelaide Football Club and Hawthorn Football Club in the Australian Football League.[1] Dew was acknowledged as being a long penetrating left foot kick of the football.[2]\n\nDew made his debut with the Port Adelaide in 1997, their inaugural year in the AFL. But it was not until the 1998 season that he received regular selection. Dew became an important player for the Power as evidenced during the 2004 season when he kicked 31 goals and was a part of the club's premiership win. The 2005 season saw Dew play a running half-back role and played in all 24 games. On 6 November 2006, Dew announced his retirement from the AFL.[3]\n\nDespite not playing football at any level during 2007, Dew announced his intentions to come out of retirement to play a final year with Central Districts. However, Alastair Clarkson, his former assistant coach at Port Adelaide and now head coach at Hawthorn encouraged him to nominate for the 2007 AFL National Draft,[4] where he was selected by Hawthorn with its third round selection (No. 45 overall). He debuted for Hawthorn against Melbourne in round 1, 2008, and injured his hamstring in his second match against Fremantle. He missed some games later in the year by injuring his hamstring again but was fit and playing well by the time of the finals. Stuart repaid the faith shown in him with a brilliant burst in the Grand Final when the result was still in the balance in the third quarter, kicking two goals and setting up two others. A series of soft tissues injuries restricted Dew to 11 games in 2009 and he announced his retirement from AFL at the end of the 2009 season.[5]\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Dew, accepted a position with the Sydney Swans as an assistant coach in 2010. He remained with Sydney until 4 October 2017.[6]\n\nDew was announced as the senior coach of Gold Coast Suns on 4 October 2017.[1] Dew replaced Gold Coast Suns caretaker senior coach Dean Solomon, who replaced Rodney Eade during the 2017 season with three games left to go after Eade stepped down, when told he would not receive a contract renewal as senior coach.[7][8]\n\nIn Dew\u2019s first season as senior coach In the 2018 season, the Suns did not see improved results with on-field performance with a 17th finish on the ladder with four wins and 18 losses.[9] In the 2019 season, the club's ladder position further deteriorated to finish in last place for the wooden spoon with three wins and 19 losses.[10] In the 2020 season, the Suns improved to finish in 14th place on the ladder with five wins, one draw and 11 losses.[11] The 2021 season saw the Suns finish 16th on the ladder.[12]\n\nTeam\n\nIndividual\n\nDew is married to former Seven News presenter Sarah Cumming and they have two children.[15][16]\n\n* denotes rookie listed players\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Dew"}, {"id": 145, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/29/568343/original/ben-foden-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Ben Foden", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/ben-foden/568343", "desc": "Benjamin James Foden (born 22 July 1985) is a rugby union player who plays for Rugby United New York (RUNY).

A fullback or scrum-half, he won 34 caps for England between 2009 and 2013. He also plays as a Wing.\n\nBorn in Chester, Foden was educated at Bishop Heber High School in Malpas, Cheshire before moving to the sixth form at Bromsgrove School.[citation needed] His Bromsgrove School teacher Paul Mullan was a big influence on his career, as was his father, Rob, who coached Ben and brother Tom's youth team.[citation needed]\n\nFoden's career has been divided between playing at scrum-half and fullback, though he can also operate on the wing. In an interview in March 2009, Foden accepted that his future lay at playing fullback.[4]\n\nFoden played for Cheshire and North of England U16s, and England U16s. He then went on to play for England U19s, and England Counties.\n\nHe joined Sale Sharks in 2004. Foden's desire to play scrum half saw him sign for Northampton Saints on the basis of a promise to play him at his preferred position; a promise that Sale Sharks could not give him,[5] considering his strong performances at full-back, and the club presence of England international scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth and the arrival of Welsh international Dwayne Peel for the next season. In the 2005\u20132006 season, Foden played as a replacement in the final as Sale won their first ever Premiership title.[6]\n\nHe gained his nickname of \"Pop Idol\" or \"Pops\" by missing the first day of pre-season with the Sharks for an audition on the programme.[7]\n\nHe began his Northampton Saints career competing with Lee Dickson for the scrum half position; Dickson won the battle for the scrum half shirt, and Northampton frequently used Foden at full back. In the 2008\u201309 season, he helped the Saints win the European Challenge Cup.[8]\n\nIn March 2011, following a Saints win over Wasps, Foden was arrested following an altercation with a taxi driver in London, but both Northampton and the RFU were happy to let the issue lie after he accepted a police caution.\n\nIn May 2014, Foden won the Aviva Premiership title with Northampton, playing 80 minutes plus extra time in the final against Saracens at full back and scoring a try.[9]\n\nFoden played on the wing for most of the 2016-17 season, scoring five tries.[10] The most recent of those tries came as Saints secured their place in the European Rugby Champions Cup for the following campaign as they fought off Stade Francais in the European Champions Cup play-off final.[11]\n\nAfter a decade with the club Northampton confirmed that Foden would be leaving at the end of the 2017/18 season. In July 2018, Rugby United New York announced that they had signed Foden for the 2019 Major League Rugby Season.[12]\n\nFoden was included in the England U21s team for the 2005 Six Nations and World Championships, and the 2006 Six Nations and World Championship. Foden was a member of the 2006 Grand Slam winning England U21 squad, playing in all five matches and notching up three tries. He went on to play at the 2006 Under 21 Rugby World Championship later that year, sharing the number 9 jersey with Danny Care. He played for the England Sevens in 2006/7 and 2007/8, and the England Saxons at the 2008 Churchill Cup against USA before being included in the England Elite Playing Squad.\n\nFoden was named in the England squad for the Six Nations on 14 January 2009, and earned his first cap for the England v Italy match on 7 February 2009 when he came on as a replacement at scrum-half for Harry Ellis, with England winning 36\u201311.[13]\n\nFoden was included in the England squad for the 2009 summer tour against the Barbarians and Argentina and made his first start for England in the uncapped game against the Barbarians on 30 May 2009, a game which saw him playing on the wing and scoring a try in the 32nd minute.[14]\n\nDespite fullback Delon Armitage being injured for the 2009 Investec Autumn Internationals, Foden was not included in the squad \u2013 manager Martin Johnson instead preferring to play wings Ugo Monye and Mark Cueto out of position.[15] By the 2010 Six Nations, Armitage was fit again, though a series of below par performances saw Foden seize the 15 shirt, with substitute performances against Ireland and Scotland, before gaining his first Test start against France. An improved performance by the England side saw Foden score his first try in a Test match, though the team lost 12\u201310.[16]\n\nFoden retained his starting place for the summer tour to Australia, playing with club colleague Chris Ashton. Although England lost the first Test,[17] they won the second 20\u201321. He also featured as a replacement in an uncapped game for England against the New Zealand Maori side.[18]\n\nFoden was named in the elite player squad for the 2010\u201311 season.[19]\nLater that year he cemented his place as England's first-choice fullback, his early flirtation with scrum-half shelved after some strong form. Foden was a key member of the side that beat Australia twice in 2010 and also started all of England's Six Nations games as they came up short of a Grand Slam in 2011. He gained more metres (100.6) in the 2011 6 Nations than any other player in the Championship. Foden was selected for England's 2011 World Cup squad, holding off the challenge of Delon Armitage to retain the fullback shirt during England's disappointing campaign.\n\nIn October 2019, Foden was a contestant in The X Factor: Celebrity as a member of the group, Try Star, alongside Levi Davis and Thom Evans. They were eliminated in the semi-final, finishing in fifth place.\n\nIn October 2021, it was announced that Foden would be participating in the fourteenth series of Dancing on Ice.\n\n\u2020 Full international cap not awarded for Barbarians Test match [14]\n\nFoden married Una Healy of girl group The Saturdays on 30 June 2012 in her native Ireland.[20] They have two children, daughter Aoife (b.2012) and son Tadhg (b.2015).[21] In July 2018, it was announced that Foden and Healy had separated.[22] Foden married Jackie Belanoff-Smith in 2019.[23] On 20 May 2020, Jackie gave birth to their daughter Farrah.[24]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Foden"}, {"id": 146, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Ben Thatcher", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/ben-thatcher/569100", "desc": "Benjamin David Thatcher (born 30 November 1975 in Swindon, Wiltshire) is a former footballer.

He also played for Millwall, Charlton Athletic and Ipswich Town He represented England's under-21 national team on four occasions, but chose to represent the Wales national team in his senior years, for whom he earned seven caps.\n\nThatcher was born in Swindon, Wiltshire. As a youth, he played Sunday League football for various amateur teams in London, before attending the Football Association (FA)'s School of Excellence at Lilleshall.[2]\n\nUpon graduation, he signed his first professional contract with Millwall, making his debut in the 1993\u201394 season at the age of 18. The following season, he established himself in the Millwall first team, and scored his first goal as a professional. He made more than 100 appearances for Millwall, and won their Player of the Year award for the 1995\u201396 season.[3]\n\nIn the 1996 close season, he was transferred to Wimbledon F.C. for a fee of more than \u00a31.8million - making him Wimbledon's first million-pound signing and doubling the club's previous record fee which had been paid for Efan Ekoku three years earlier.[4]\n\nIn his first season at Wimbledon, Thatcher made only nine appearances, but played more regularly in subsequent seasons. He was banned for two matches in January 2000 for elbowing Nicky Summerbee of Sunderland to the head in the build-up to a goal;[5] the incident was missed by the referee but action was taken by the governing body following a video review.[6] After Wimbledon's relegation from the Premiership at the end of the 1999\u20132000 season, Thatcher moved to Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThatcher cost Tottenham Hotspur a fee of around \u00a35 million in the Summer of 2000. A few months after the transfer, Spurs manager George Graham was sacked, and Thatcher featured less frequently under successor Glenn Hoddle, though he was a member of the Spurs team for the 2002 League Cup final.\n\nThatcher subsequently moved to Leicester City in a \u00a3300,000 transfer deal in the summer 2003,[7] immediately proceeding to attack Glenn Hoddle's style of management.[8]\n\nAfter a single season at Leicester, Thatcher once again found himself in the arms of a relegated club, and moved to Manchester City. He scored once in the league for Leicester, in a 4\u20134 draw with his former club Spurs.[9]\n\nHis move to Manchester City cost around \u00a3100,000. His Manchester City debut came on the opening day of the 2004\u201305 season against Fulham. He was initially the first choice left-back at Manchester City, but a combination of injuries and the emergence of Stephen Jordan limited him to 21 appearances in his first season for the club. In January 2005 Thatcher nearly joined Fulham for a fee of \u00a3500,000 after a series of burglaries unsettled his family, but the move fell through.[7][10] His second Manchester City season followed a similar pattern to the first, with most of his 19 starts coming in the first half of the season.\n\nThatcher gained notoriety on 23 August 2006, in a game between Manchester City and Portsmouth. Whilst challenging with Pedro Mendes for a loose ball Thatcher viciously and intentionally led with his elbow, knocking Mendes into the advertising hoardings rendering him unconscious. Mendes required oxygen at pitchside and suffered a seizure while being transferred to hospital, where he spent the night. Mendes was discharged from hospital the next day, but remained under medical supervision.[11] Thatcher was not sent off by referee Dermot Gallagher but given just a yellow card, but he was investigated by the FA as a result of the challenge. He was disciplined and his barrister, Rupert Bowers, read a written apology following the hearing.[12] Greater Manchester Police noted receipt of many \"statements of complaint\" and also chose to investigate the matter.[13] On 30 August, Manchester City announced that Thatcher would be banned for six matches, two of which would be suspended, and fined six weeks' wages for the challenge.[14] This punishment is separate from the sanctions made by the FA, who suspended Thatcher for eight matches, with a further fifteen game suspended ban for two years.[15] Mendes shook hands with Thatcher pre-match when they next faced one another in January 2007,[16][17] despite claiming beforehand that he would not do so.[18]\n\nThatcher also faced possible action from Lancashire Police over a clash with ex-Blackburn Rovers player Ralph Welch during a reserve game at Ewood Park in February 2006.[19]\n\nHe signed for Charlton Athletic on 11 January 2007 for a reported fee of \u00a3500,000, which could rise to \u00a3750,000 depending on appearances.[20] He played his first match for Charlton Athletic on 23 January 2007 against Middlesbrough;\n[21] the team were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season.\n\nThatcher joined Ipswich Town on 14 August 2008 on a one-year contract with an option to extend it for a further year.[22] His contract was terminated by Roy Keane on 26 February 2010,[23] due to his refusal to move closer to the club.\n\nDuring his time at Wimbledon, Thatcher played for the England under-21 team four times.[24] However, in 2004 he opted to play for Wales, for whom he qualifies due to his Welsh grandmother.[25] His debut international performance came against Hungary, in a 2\u20131 victory in March 2004, and by October 2004 he had earned seven caps for Wales.\n\nIn October 2004, John Toshack was appointed new Welsh national team coach, but Thatcher did not play any games under Toshack, due to suspensions and injuries. Thatcher did not play Wales' 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches against England and Poland in early September 2005 on grounds of injury, while playing full-time three days later when Manchester City met cross-city rivals Manchester United. This angered Toshack, and Thatcher was categorically left out of the Welsh national team in September 2005.[26]\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Thatcher"}, {"id": 147, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/84/1675769/original/nicky-weaver-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Nicky Weaver", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/nicky-weaver/1675769", "desc": "Nicholas James Weaver (born 2 March 1979) is an English former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper most notably for Manchester City.

He joined Manchester City in 1997 and would go on to be a part of the club that earned promotion from the Second Division in 1999 in which he saved the decisive penalty in the play-off final shootout with Gillingham at Wembley Stadium. He would go on to earn promotion to the Premier League the following season and in total was promoted three times with City in a ten-year spell. By the time he left the club in 2007 he had been the club's second choice keeper for a number of years and had acted as understudy to the likes of Peter Schmeichel, David Seaman and David James. He went on to appear for Charlton Athletic, Dundee United, Burnley, Sheffield Wednesday and Aberdeen. He is a former England under-21 international.\n\nHe has worked for Sheffield Wednesday since retiring and has held a number of different of different roles including academy goalkeeping coach and first team coach.\n\nWeaver was bought by Manchester City from Mansfield Town on the recommendation of goalkeeping coach Alex Stepney. He made his competitive Manchester City debut in the first match of the 1998\u201399 season against Blackpool, keeping a clean sheet.[2] Over the course of the season Weaver kept a total of 26 clean sheets, breaking the club record for clean sheets in a season. Weaver was the hero for Manchester City in the 1999 Second Division Play-off final versus Gillingham after his penalty save clinched promotion, prompting him to go on a 'crazy run' around the Wembley pitch. Around this time, Weaver was tipped to receive full international honours for England by Jon McGinty after becoming an England under 21 international.[3][4]\n\nWeaver remained first choice goalkeeper in 1999\u20132000, as City secured a second consecutive promotion by finishing in second place in the First Division.[5] He then tasted Premier League football for the first time in the 2000\u201301 season,[6] as the club was relegated in its first top flight campaign since 1996.[7] Weaver missed almost half of City's league matches in 2001\u201302 through injury, as the club was again promoted back to the Premier League.[7] Weaver's growing injury problems lead to Keegan signing veteran Peter Schmeichel for the 2002\u201303 season, with Weaver dropping to second choice.\n\nWeaver did not start any games in the 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304 and 2004\u201305 seasons.[8][9][10] However, he did play the last fifteen minutes of the 2004\u201305 season, when Stuart Pearce surprisingly substituted Claudio Reyna for Weaver so the regular City goalkeeper David James could play in attack against Middlesbrough.[11]\n\nWeaver's return to fitness resulted in injury once again during the close season of 2005, ruling him out of the start of the season. In Autumn 2005 Weaver went on loan to Sheffield Wednesday, the team he had supported since childhood and for whom he had played as a schoolboy,[12][13] in an attempt to return to full fitness.\n\nWhile at Wednesday, Weaver made 14 appearances, beginning with a 2\u20131 victory at home to Derby County and ending with a 3\u20130 defeat away at Leeds United.[14] He also played in the Steel City derby away at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United, where Wednesday were beaten 1\u20130.[14] He was the only Sheffield born player in the entire fixture.[15]\n\nBefore the 2006\u201307 season, Manchester City sold James to Portsmouth, bought Andreas Isaksson as a replacement and gave Isaksson the number 1 shirt. However, an injury to Isaksson meant Weaver played the first game of the season on 20 August 2006, his first senior start for the club in nearly three years and Weaver's improved form led to him starting all but one of the Manchester City games in the rest of 2006.[16]\n\nOn 4 July 2007, out-of-contract Weaver signed for Charlton Athletic on a free transfer.[17] On 5 April 2008, Weaver was sent off after three minutes for handball in a match against Plymouth Argyle.[18] The incident marked the quickest ever dismissal of a Charlton player, a record that would remain until 2018.[19][20] Following his release from Charlton, Weaver signed for Dundee United on 5 August 2009 on a short-term contract.[21] The United fans took to him instantly and \u2013 although he was pelted by snowballs by Aberdeen fans in his final home match at Tannadice as the ground staff thought it was a good idea not to clear all the snow[22] \u2013  he played in every league match before his contract expired in January 2010.\n\nOn 27 January 2010, Weaver signed an initial six-month contract with Burnley on a free transfer subject to international clearance. However, he was released on 11 May 2010 without making a single appearance.[23]\n\nWith Lee Grant's departure from Sheffield Wednesday to Burnley in the close season,[24] Weaver the ex-Owl loanee and Wednesday fan signed as a replacement after the club's transfer embargo was lifted.[25] On 4 October 2010, Weaver was awarded the Handley Brown player of the month for September after a number of impressive performances in an underachieving Wednesday team.[26] Weaver was awarded man of the match against Chesterfield in a Football League Trophy second round match after scoring the decisive penalty and saving three spot kicks, two of which were vital sudden death saves to keep Wednesday in the competition.\n\nWeaver received his second successive Player of The Month award off the club for his performances in October. His consistent performances led to him signing a new two-and-a-half-year deal on 14 February 2011, which due to an oversight by the press office was not announced until 4 April. Weaver fell out of favour at Sheffield Wednesday following the signing of Chris Kirkland, with Kirkland inheriting Weaver's no.1 shirt. After failing to appear in any matchday squad since Kirkland's arrival, he was released at the end of the season.\n\nOn 15 July 2013, Weaver signed for Aberdeen on a six-month contract.[27][28] This was extended for a further six months in January 2014.[29]\n\nIn September 2014, Weaver returned to Sheffield Wednesday as academy goalkeeping coach. He replaced Andy Rhodes as first team goalkeeping coach in July 2018.[13]\nOn 14 August 2020, it was confirmed as part of a coaching staff restructure, Weaver would switch roles and become Head of Academy Goalkeeping, the position he originally had when joining the club as staff.[30]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Weaver"}, {"id": 148, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/94/1879149/original/ray-parlour-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Ray Parlour", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/ray-parlour/1879149", "desc": "Raymond Parlour (born 7 March 1973) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder from 1992 to 2007.\nHe spent his career playing for Arsenal, Middlesbrough, Hull City.

His increasing success in his Gunners shirt did not, however, secure him a place in England's 1998 World Cup squad, coach Glenn Hoddle preferring Spurs' Darren Anderton instead.\n\nIn March 2000, he hit a hat-trick in a 4\u20132 away win at Werder Bremen (6\u20132 aggregate) in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals.[4] He was the only Arsenal player successful from the penalty spot in the team's shoot-out defeat by Galatasaray in the final.[5] Seven months later, he contributed another hat-trick to a 5\u20130 win over Newcastle United at Highbury. In April 2001, at the same ground, he struck a 30-yard winner as Arsenal beat Valencia 2\u20131 in the first leg tie of a UEFA Champions League quarter-final.[6] In 2002, another year in which Arsenal won the Double, he opened the scoring in the Gunners' 2\u20130 FA Cup Final victory over Chelsea, putting his club ahead with a 30-yard strike that Soccer AM's commentator Tim Lovejoy famously failed to anticipate: \"Oh, it's all right, it's only Ray Parlour\".[7] In November 2003, he was the stand-in captain who led his team to a 5\u20131 victory over Internazionale at the San Siro.[8]\n\nIn total, Parlour played 466 games for the Gunners, scoring 32 goals in all competitions. His curriculum vitae with the club includes three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup and one European Cup Winners' Cup. As of April 2020, his record of 333 Premier League appearances for Arsenal has not been surpassed by any other player in the club's history. Even at the peak of his success, though, he was less acclaimed by football journalists than several of his Arsenal contemporaries, spending much of his time at the club in the shadow of Patrick Vieira in particular. Many Arsenal fans believe him to have been one of the most underrated players of his generation.[9]\n\nIn July 2004, Parlour joined fellow Premier League club Middlesbrough on a free transfer, signing a three-year contract at the Riverside Stadium.[10]  He played 60 games for Boro in two and a half years, and was an unused substitute in their 4\u20130 defeat by Sevilla in the 2006 UEFA Cup Final.[11] In October 2005, he was ruled out for two months for knee cartilage surgery. He was released from his contract on 25 January 2007, and returned to train at Arsenal.[12]\n\nOn 9 February 2007, Hull City signed Parlour until the end of the 2006\u201307 season in the hope that his experience would help them to avoid relegation.[13] With their place in the Championship secured, it was confirmed on 1 June that the club would not be retaining Parlour's services for the following season's campaign.[14]\n\nIn June 2012, Parlour was one of several retired footballers enlisted by the semi-professional Wembley to assist them in the forthcoming season's FA Cup. His fellow former internationals Claudio Caniggia, Graeme Le Saux, Martin Keown and Brian McBride joined him as players, David Seaman was recruited as a goalkeeping coach and Terry Venables, formerly the manager of England, served as the club's technical advisor. A television documentary recorded the team's improbable quest for Wembley Stadium glory. In the event, although Wembley knocked out Langford, the club proved unable to progress beyond a replay against Uxbridge.[15]\n\nParlour made his debut for the England under-21 team on 12 May 1992; he played the whole game as England drew 2\u20132 with Hungary in a friendly.[16] He was a part of the squads that participated in the Toulon Tournament in 1992 and 1994, England would ultimately win the tournament in 1994 with Parlour playing in the final against Portugal.[16][17][18] Parlour won the Prix Sp\u00e9cial award for his performances in the tournament.[18],\nOverall, he appeared for the U21s on twelve occasions without scoring any goals.[16] On 10 February 1998, he played for the B-team in a 1\u20130 loss to Chile at The Hawthorns.[19]\n\nHe made his senior team debut as a substitute in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Poland on 27 March 1999; he won ten caps for England altogether, without ever scoring any goals. The closest he came to one was in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Finland on 11 October 2000, when he 'scored' with a 30-yard strike which hit the crossbar and crossed the goal-line but was incorrectly disallowed by a linesman, the match finishing 0\u20130. He did not feature in any tournament finals, a knee injury forcing him to withdraw from England's squad for Euro 2000.[20][21] His final cap came in a friendly against Italy on 15 November 2000. He was called up into the squad several times by new manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson in 2001, but was never sent onto the pitch.[19]\n\nParlour began his career as a pundit with Setanta Sports in 2007.[22] He has since appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, Parlour featured in both seasons of ITV show Harry's Heroes, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.[23]\n\nParlour and his wife Karen were a couple from their early youth, although they did not get married until 1998. They have three children: Charlotte, Frankie and Georgina. Their separation in 2001 led to a very high-profile divorce. In July 2004, they agreed how to divide their existing wealth\u00a0\u2013 Parlour giving Karen two mortgage-free houses and \u00a3250,000\u00a0\u2013 but they were unable to negotiate a mutually satisfactory arrangement over their income. Parlour thought that \u00a3120,000 a year would be enough to meet Karen's and their children's needs: Karen wanted more. The ensuing court case concluded in an award that increased Parlour's annual payment to \u00a3212,500, but neither party was satisfied with this outcome, and both appealed against the finding. The couple's second round of litigation resulted in Karen's being awarded an income of \u00a3440,000 a year to be paid for five years, an amount that the Court of Appeal thought sufficient to allow her to put aside \u00a3250,000 a year to add to her capital. The case led media commentators to suggest that the finding heralded a new era in the divorces of wealthy couples, with non-earning spouses being awarded a larger share of their former partner's income than hitherto, and some pundits forecast an increasing use of prenuptial agreements in consequence.[24]\n\nSource:[25]\n\nArsenal\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nEngland U21\n\nIndividual\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Parlour"}, {"id": 149, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/357/7121039/original/-kos-tak-cs-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "\u00c1kos Tak\u00e1cs", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/\u00e1kos-tak\u00e1cs/7121039", "desc": "\u00c1kos Tak\u00e1cs (born 14 February 1982) is a Hungarian professional football player, who currently Plays for Gy\u0151ri ETO FC.

Docherty played for several clubs, most notably Preston North End, and represented Scotland 25 times between 1951 and 1959. He then managed a total of 13 clubs between 1961 and 1988, as well as the Scottish national team. Docherty was manager of Manchester United between 1972 and 1977, during which time they were relegated to the Second Division, but promoted back to the First Division as champions at the first attempt.\n\nBorn in Shettleston Road in Glasgow's east end, Docherty began his playing career when he joined junior football club Shettleston. The turning point in his playing career came in 1946 when he was called up for national service in the Highland Light Infantry.[4] While completing his national service, Docherty represented the British Army at football. On demobilisation, he was offered a contract with Celtic in 1947. Docherty would later say that Jimmy Hogan, the club's coach, was his greatest influence.[5]\n\nIn November 1949, after spending over two years with Celtic, he moved to England and joined Preston North End. With them he won the 1951 Second Division title and got to the 1954 FA Cup Final. Altogether Docherty made close to 300 appearances for the club.[6] He left Deepdale in August 1958 to join Arsenal for \u00a328,000 (\u00a3696,000 today). With them he made 83 appearances, scoring once. He then went to play for Chelsea where he brought an end to his playing career in 1962.[7]\n\nAt Preston, Docherty received the first of his 25 full Scotland international caps. His solitary goal came in a 7\u20132 defeat by England in 1955.[8] He was part of the Scotland squads that played at the 1954 and 1958 FIFA World Cup finals which were held in Switzerland and Sweden, respectively.[8]\n\nIn February 1961, Docherty was offered the post of player-coach of Chelsea. Less than twelve months later, upon Ted Drake's departure and with the club facing relegation from the top flight, Docherty took over as manager. He was unable to keep the club in the First Division, however, and the team was relegated at the end of the 1961\u201362 season.[9]\n\nDuring his first year in charge he sold many of the club's older players and brought in new ones such as Terry Venables, Bobby Tambling, Peter Bonetti and Barry Bridges.[10] He also changed the club's home colours, switching from white shorts to blue shorts, the combination that remains as of 2022. The team, nicknamed \"Docherty's Diamonds\", achieved promotion back to Division One in their first attempt and finished fifth the following year. In 1964\u201365, Chelsea won the League Cup in April with an aggregate win over Leicester City, but in the FA Cup were beaten 2\u20130 in the semi-final by eventual winners Liverpool.[9]\n\nDocherty led Chelsea to the FA and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals a year later, before reaching the FA Cup Final in 1967, which they lost to Tottenham Hotspur. He resigned in October 1967. The core of the team Docherty had put together, including Peter Osgood, Charlie Cooke, Ron Harris, Bonetti and John Hollins, went on to win the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup under Docherty's successor, Dave Sexton. A decade later Sexton succeeded Docherty as manager of Manchester United.[9]\n\nThe month following his departure from Chelsea, Docherty became manager of Rotherham United. He said of his year there: \"I promised I would take Rotherham out of the Second Division \u2013 and I took them into the Third. The old chairman said 'Doc, you\u2019re a man of your word!'\"[11] He was then appointed manager at Queens Park Rangers, only to leave 29 days later after arguing with the club chairman over transfer policy.[12] He then became Doug Ellis' first manager at Aston Villa in December 1968, for 13 months. On 19 January 1970, with Aston Villa bottom of the Second Division, Docherty was sacked.[13]\n\nFrom there he went to FC Porto, where he stayed for 16 months before resigning in May 1971, having failed to usurp Benfica and Sporting.[14] On 2 July 1971, he was appointed by Hull City as assistant manager to Terry Neill, but on 12 September he left to become the caretaker manager of Scotland, with that position becoming permanent in November 1971.[15] Scotland were on course to qualify for the 1974 World Cup under Docherty,[15] having won both of their matches against Denmark in qualification Group 8. Docherty managed 12 Scotland games, the last of which was a 2\u20130 home win against the Danes in November 1972.[16] He left the job a month later and was succeeded by Willie Ormond, who secured qualification for the World Cup by winning a home match against Czechoslovakia in September 1973.[16]\n\nIn December 1972, Docherty attended a match that Manchester United lost 5-0 to Crystal Palace; in the Selhurst Park boardroom afterwards he was offered the Manchester United job by Matt Busby. [15] His first game in charge of United was against Leeds United at Old Trafford. The game finished 1\u20131, with Ted MacDougall scoring one of his few goals for United. Although United were in serious trouble when he took them over, because of an ageing squad, he managed to keep them in the First Division in 1972\u201373. The 1973\u201374 season saw United continue to struggle and they were eventually relegated to the Second Division.[6][15][17]\n\nIn the following season, United returned to the top flight as Second Division champions. In 1975\u201376 they finished in third place in the First Division and also reached the 1976 FA Cup Final, but lost 1\u20130 to Southampton who were then in the Second Division. Docherty led United to the FA Cup final again in 1977, this time as underdogs, and beat league champions Liverpool 2\u20131.[6][15][17]\n\nShortly afterwards, news that Docherty was having an extramarital affair with the wife of a United physiotherapist, Mary Brown, became public. He was sacked in a blaze of publicity in July 1977, and was replaced at Old Trafford by Dave Sexton, the same man who had replaced him at Chelsea. The affair also resulted in the end of his marriage to Agnes, who had been his wife since December 1949. In 1988 Docherty married Mary,[18] and the couple remained together until his death in 2020. After his sacking, Docherty had a frosty relationship with the club.[6][17][15]\n\nDocherty became manager at Derby County in September 1977, where he made 30 signings in 20 months making quite a bit of money on the side . he stayed for two seasons before resigning when he got caught taking back handers in May 1979.[19] His next appointment was at Queens Park Rangers in May 1979.[13] When he took over at Loftus Road, Rangers had been relegated to the Second Division (three years after almost winning the league title) and he had to lift the team's spirits to start the new season.[20] QPR finished the season four points short of promotion to the First Division. In May 1980, Docherty was sacked by chairman Jim Gregory, then reinstated after just nine days away. In October 1980, he was sacked for the second time in five months.[21]\n\nThis was followed by a short spell in Australia coaching Sydney Olympic in 1981.[22] He returned to England in July that year to manage Preston North End,[13] where he had spent nine years as a player. He left after a few months, returning to Australia to manage South Melbourne until the following year. He also managed Sydney Olympic again in 1983.[22]\n\nDocherty returned to England once more with Wolverhampton Wanderers just after their relegation from the First Division in 1984. He was sacked just over a year later, however, when Wolves had suffered a second successive relegation, eventually going on to suffer a third relegation in a row the season after Docherty's departure. \n\nDocherty's time at Wolves was to be a tough task. The club had once been three times champions of England in the 1950's and had also hosted Honved under the floodlights at their stadium \"The Molineux\" in 1954, pioneering the way for European Club Football.[23]\n\nThey had since gone on to be finalists in the 1972 European Cup and winners of the 1980 League Cup where Andy Gray scored the winning goal after setting a British Transfer Record signing when he signed for the club.[24][25]\n\nThe club Docherty was taking over as Manager was far away from the historic club Wolves had once been with the chairman in 1978 bankrupting the club with the rebuilding of the Molineux Street stand. A rescue package had to be brought in place during 1982, with the club just hours away from going out of business it was purchased by the Bhatti Brothers, two Saudi Arabian businessmen with help from club legend Derek Dougan.[26][27]\n\nThe brothers were property developers and wanted to develop the land around the stadium but when the council did not grant them permissions they sought, relationship with the club soured and the club was receiving no investment and involvement from the brothers.[28]\n\nFollowing relegation from the top flight the previous season, several key players left the club, including goalscorers Mel Eaves and Wayne Clarke, as well as Tony Towner and 2nd highest club appearances holder Kenny Hibbitt.[29][30]\n\n\"Tommy Docherty came in as manager and he knew I didn't want to be around to see the club in such dire straits\" cited Hibbitt when interviewed on his thoughts on leaving Wolves.[31]\n\nDocherty would also have problems leading into the season with first choice goalkeeper John Burridge, who was making demands of the club but instead of meeting these, Docherty promoted 17 year academy player Tim Flowers into goal where he remained for the season with Burridge also leaving the club.[32][33]\n\nThe 1984-85 season began at home to Sheffield United in front 14,908 fans. After a good start to the season, later progress started to slowly disintegrated and the club found themselves bouncing around position 13th - 15th position in the table by November.[34]\n\nWolves were misfiring but despite this, Docherty allowed central defender Geoff Palmer, having been capped 394 times for the club, to move to Burnley. Palmer was a very experienced defender and with him leaving, this left a far less experienced team to that which had finished the previous season. Palmer left the club believing he had fallen out if favour with Docherty and cited that \"the club just wasn\u2019t a nice place to be at the time, it wasn\u2019t being run properly, and was on its knees.\"[35]\n\nShortly afterwards, Wolves endured a 21-match winless run in all competitions (19 of those in the Second Division). Pressure was mounting in January 1985 and former fan favourite and now Chairman Derek Dougan eventually resigned from his position on the board.[36]\n\nThe season performances would also see the club be beaten 5-1 on three occasions. Two of them televised live on ITV and the other, away at Brighton & Hove Albion the day the club were officially relegated. Docherty's final game at home was against Huddersfield Town where Wolves secured just their 8th victory of the season, in front of just 4,422 fans. Wolves finished the season bottom of the table and Docherty's torrid season had finally come to an end. He left the club in July 1985.[37][38]\n\nWhen asked about his time at Wolves Docherty said, \"I could hardly say \u2018no\u2019 when a club as famous as that came in for me..... But it was a hopeless task really. There was no money. I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to work with Derek Dougan but I accepted the challenge anyway. As for the Bhattis, I only met them twice \u2013 once when they hired me and once when they fired me.\"[39]\n\nDocherty took up his final managerial position at Altrincham. He retired from management at the end of the 1987\u201388 season.[40]\n\nDocherty married his first wife, Agnes, in December 1949, after he left his native Scotland to sign for Preston North End.[41] They were married for 27 years until Docherty announced his affair with Mary Brown in 1977.[17] Docherty and Agnes had four children together: Mick (himself a former professional footballer and manager), Thomas Jr., Catherine and Peter. After marrying Mary Brown, he had two more children \u2013 daughters Grace and Lucy \u2013 who were born during the 1980s.[41] Agnes died in September 2002 at the age of 73.[42] In 2008, Tommy Docherty Jr. released a book, Married to a Man of Two Halves, which was based on memoirs and newspaper cuttings which he had discovered when clearing out his mother's house after her death.[43]\n\nDocherty died on 31 December 2020, aged 92, following a long illness.[14]\n\nPreston North End[7]\n\nChelsea[44]\n\nManchester United[44]\n\nScotland[45]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Docherty"}, {"id": 151, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Adil Khan", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/adil-khan/67360756", "desc": "Adil Ahmed Khan is an Indian footballer who currently plays for Bharat FC in the I-League as a Defensive Midfielder or as a Right Back.", "full_desc": "\n\nAdil Ahmad Khan (born 7 July 1988), is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a defender or defensive midfielder for Indian Super League club Hyderabad and the India national team.\n\nA product of the Sesa Football Academy, Adil Khan started his football career in SESA in 2003 where he played for 5 years before moving to Sporting Goa in 2008.

Nicknamed Le Roi (The King) for his ability and leadership, he was a prolific goalscorer; he won the Serie A capocannoniere award three consecutive times between 1983 and 1985, and was the top scorer of Juventus's victorious 1984\u201385 European Cup campaign.[8] Platini was a key player of the France national team that won the 1984 European Championship, a tournament in which he was the top scorer and best player, and reached the semi-finals of the 1982 and 1986 World Cups. Together with midfielders Alain Giresse, Luis Fern\u00e1ndez and Jean Tigana, he formed the carr\u00e9 magique (magic square) of the French team in the 1980s. Platini was his country's record goalscorer until 2007, and held the record for most goals (9) scored in the European Championship until being surpassed by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021, despite only appearing in the victorious 1984 edition.[8]\n\nFollowing his retirement as a player, Platini was the France national team coach for four years, and was the co-organizer of the 1998 World Cup in France. In 2007, he became the first former player to be elected as the president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). He also held the positions of chairman of FIFA's Technical and Development Committee and vice-president of the French Football Federation.\n\nBorn in J\u0153uf, in the Lorraine region, Platini is the son of Aldo and Anna (n\u00e9e Piccinelli), both of Italian ancestry. Anna's family has its roots in the province of Belluno, while Aldo's father, Francesco Platini, was an immigrant from Agrate Conturbia, in the province of Novara, and settled in France shortly after the end of the First World War.[9] Aldo was a professional footballer and a long-time director for AS Nancy, the club where Michel started his professional career.\n\nAfter performing poorly in the final of a 1969 young footballers' competition, Michel Platini attracted attention at 16 years of age in a Coupe Gambardella tournament match with an impressive display for J\u0153uf juniors against a Metz junior side. Platini was called up for a trial with Metz, but missed out on the opportunity due to injury, and was not immediately invited back after the Metz coach moved to another club. He returned to regional league football with J\u0153uf. Another trial at Metz went horribly wrong when a breathing test on a spirometer caused Platini to faint. The doctor's verdict on Platini's breathing difficulties and weak heart ended any hopes Platini had of playing for his boyhood favorites. He then joined the reserve side of his father's club Nancy in September 1972, and became friends with team goalkeeper Jean-Michel Moutier.\n\nPlatini was quick to make a big impression at his new club, scoring a hat-trick in a reserve team match against Wittelsheim. Further outstanding displays put him in contention for a place in the Nancy first team. His introduction to the first-team squad was inauspicious. On the substitutes' bench for a match against Valenciennes, Platini was spat on and hit by various objects thrown from the crowd when a fight broke out in the stands. Playing for the reserves a few days later, a hefty challenge from an opponent left Platini with a bad ankle injury. His season would finish on a more positive note, and he would go on to make his league debut against N\u00eemes on 3 May 1973.\n\nIn March 1974, he suffered a setback when he sustained a double fracture of his left arm in a match at OGC Nice. Platini missed the remainder of the season as a result, unable to assist Nancy in an unsuccessful bid to avoid relegation from Ligue 1. The following season saw Nancy win promotion back to the French first division with ease. Platini became the team's most important player, scoring 17 goals, a number of which were scored from free-kicks, as was becoming Platini's specialty. Saint-\u00c9tienne, the then reigning French league champions, were knocked out of the French Cup with two goals from Platini free-kicks. Platini practised his free-kicks with the help of his friend, goalkeeper Moutier, and using a row of dummies to form a defensive wall of sorts.\n\nWith Nancy back in Ligue 1, Platini's military service reduced his availability for matches, but he continued to make himself available to play when possible. In a match away to Laval, Platini, angered by the taunts of the home supporters, scored a hat-trick, but unluckily sustained another injury. Press reports claimed that Platini's season was over and that he would require a knee operation, but neither claim proved to be correct. Instead, Platini returned to first-team football two weeks later for Nancy's French Cup semi-final against Marseille at the Parc des Princes. Platini headed the only Nancy goal in their 4\u20131 loss and was forced to leave the field injured. Following his participation in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Platini signed a two-year contract with Nancy, his first professional contract.\n\nBefore travelling to Argentina for the World Cup, Platini won the first major trophy of his playing career, captaining Nancy to victory in the 1978 French Cup final against Nice and scoring the only goal of the game. President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing presented him with the trophy. However, with the World Cup scheduled to start two weeks after the cup final, there was little time left for preparation.\n\nAlthough Platini was not disgraced by his performances at his first World Cup, fans held him responsible for the French team's failure to progress in the tournament, and in the season that followed he was a target of jeering crowds. The situation came to a head in a match away to Saint-\u00c9tienne. Spurred on by booing fans, Platini competed for every ball, and he picked up a bad ankle injury in a tackle. As a result, he was ruled out of Nancy's Cup Winners' Cup campaign. His contract with the club expired in June 1979, and Internazionale, Paris Saint-Germain, and Saint-\u00c9tienne emerged as the clubs most likely to sign him, although the Nancy club president had been unwilling to let Platini leave the club. Having set his mind on a transfer to Saint-\u00c9tienne, he signed a three-year contract with les Verts.\n\nIn spite of his injuries and the boos that would greet him, Platini maintained his pranksterish sense of humour. On away trips, he would set off firecrackers in public places and then pretend to be dead, inevitably drawing a crowd. While in Argentina for the World Cup, he would squeeze tubes of toothpaste into his teammates' beds.\n\nPlatini's three years at Saint-\u00c9tienne were a mixed success. The club had signed him with a view to success in the European Cup, but despite some excellent results (including a 6\u20130 win over PSV in the 1979\u201380 UEFA Cup and a 5\u20130 win at Hamburger SV in the UEFA Cup the following season), the club were unable to surpass the feats of the Saint-\u00c9tienne side that had reached the final of the 1976 European Cup.\n\nPlatini won the French league title in 1981 with Les Verts, but was on a losing Saint-\u00c9tienne side in two French Cup finals, against Bastia in 1981 and against Paris Saint-Germain in 1982, in what was his last match for the club before joining Juventus. He left for a nominal transfer fee (under UEFA regulations) despite being out of contract and no fee being necessary under French regulations at the time.[10]\n\nAt Juventus, Platini inherited the number 10 shirt from the recently departed Liam Brady.[11][12] In a team featuring numerous members of Italy's victorious World Cup squad, Platini had a difficult introduction to Italian football. He was a target in the demanding Italian sports media, and even came close to leaving Italy in the winter of his first season. Platini and teammate Zbigniew Boniek successfully called for a change in tactics, and in the second half of the season Juventus saw an upturn in their fortunes. They reached the European Cup final, losing to Hamburger SV, but won the Italian Cup, the first of many club honours to follow for Platini in the coming seasons.\n\n\"We bought him for a morsel of bread and he put foie gras on top of it!\"\n\n\u2014Gianni Agnelli, Juventus president.[13]\n\nHe won the Serie A title with Juventus in 1984 and 1986, the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1984 (setting up Vignola's opening goal in the Turin club's 2\u20131 victory over Porto in the final of the competition),[14][15] the 1984 European Super Cup, the European Cup in 1985 and the 1985 Intercontinental Cup. He finished top scorer in Serie A for three consecutive seasons (1982\u201383, 1983\u201384, and 1984\u201385), and won a hat-trick of European Footballer of the Year awards (1983 through 1985). He was also voted Player of the Year by World Soccer magazine in 1984 and 1985.\n\n\"I played for Nancy because it was my hometown club and the best in Lorraine, for Saint-\u00c9tienne because it was the best team in France, and for Juventus because it is the best team in the world!\"[16]\n\n\u2014Platini after his final match in Serie A against Brescia, in 1987.\n\nThe 1985 European Cup final against Liverpool at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels should have been the crowning moment of Platini's Juventus career, but was instead overshadowed by the Heysel Stadium disaster in which 39 people died, and 600 more were injured. It was decided to proceed with the match in order to avoid inciting any further trouble, and after both captains had appealed for calm, the match began just under an hour and a half beyond schedule, with riot police still engaged in a pitched battle with Juventus fans. Platini scored the only goal of the match from a penalty kick, which had been controversially awarded for a foul just outside the area on Zbigniew Boniek, after the Frenchman had met his run behind the defence towards goal with a long ball.[17] In the days following the final, Platini was criticised in some quarters for his lack of restraint in celebrating Juventus' win. In his own defence, Platini maintained that he had not been made fully aware of the scale of the disaster. In the 1985 Intercontinental Cup final against Argentinos Juniors, Platini scored from a penalty during regulation time, also having another goal disallowed, and later assisted Michael Laudrup's equaliser; he subsequently netted the match-winning penalty in the resulting shoot-out, and was named Man of the Match.[18][19][20] Following the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Platini spent another season at Juventus before retiring from football in June 1987.\n\nHaving first attracted the attention of national team selectors in the Coupe Gambardella tournament, Platini was selected for the French junior team, but injuries prevented him from playing. He made his first appearance for a French national selection playing for the French amateur side on 26 September 1973.\n\nPlatini began his military service in summer 1975. He was assigned to the Joinville battalion, as were all talented French sportspeople fulfilling their military obligations. His colleagues in the battalion included his Nancy teammates Olivier Rouyer and Jean-Michel Moutier, as well as Maxime Bossis, soon to become a regular in the French national team along with Platini. Platini would turn out for the French military team, in addition to representing the French under-23s and the French Olympic team. He impressed in the Olympic team's 4\u20130 win over Romania in Brest, a result made even more impressive by the fact that Romania had fielded a full international side for the Olympic qualifier. Platini's performance made him a star in France. The away leg of the qualifying tie was a mere formality, France coming away with a 1\u20131 draw. Three days after the draw in Bucharest, Platini received his first call-up to the national team for what was coach Michel Hidalgo's first game in charge, a friendly against Czechoslovakia in Paris (27 March 1976, 2\u20132), and scored his first goal with a trademark free kick.\n\nPlatini was a member of the French football team at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Their tournament began on 19 July with a 4\u20130 win over Mexico. They registered another 4\u20130 win in their next match against Guatemala, with two goals from Platini. The French team completed the group stage with a draw against Israel, Platini scoring from a penalty. France progressed to the quarter-final stage, where they would face a full-strength East German team. France lost 4\u20130 and finished the match with nine men.\n\nWith a 3\u20131 win over Bulgaria at the Parc des Princes on 16 November 1977, a match in which Platini excelled in the role of playmaker and scored with a strike from 30 yards, France secured qualification for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina for their first appearance in the World Cup finals since 1966. In the month following the decisive qualifying match, Platini finished third in the voting for the 1977 European Footballer of the Year.\n\nAmong the international friendlies France played in preparation for the World Cup, their match against Italy in Naples on 8 February 1978 (2\u20132) was particularly significant for Platini. With a number of scouts from Italian clubs in attendance, he was in excellent form. He beat Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff from two direct free-kicks, the first being ruled out because the referee had not blown his whistle. The re-taken free-kick was blocked by the defensive wall, but minutes later Platini had the ball in the Italian net from another free-kick. Zoff attempted to anticipate the flight of the ball by positioning himself on the left side of the goal, only for Platini to find the unguarded area of the net with his free-kick, leaving Zoff rooted to the spot. Platini's duels with Zoff and his performance in a match that was broadcast on Italian television made him well known in Italy. A number of clubs both in France (Paris Saint-Germain and Saint-\u00c9tienne) and across Europe (including Juventus, Internazionale, Napoli, Barcelona, Valencia, and Arsenal) began the clamour for Platini's services.[citation needed]\n\nIn retrospect, this match may have been a Pyrrhic victory because Platini's brilliance drew the attention of Italy coach Enzo Bearzot, who devised a successful plan to contain him in a match-up that really mattered\u2014the first round of the 1978 World Cup four months later.  Platini was kept in check by Marco Tardelli's implacable marking and Italy won 2\u20131. Drawn in a difficult group with Italy as well as hosts (and eventual winners) Argentina, France's loss to the hosts in Buenos Aires effectively ensured their elimination; France did not survive the first round.\n\nPlatini was nonetheless made captain of the French national side after the World Cup and made the number 10 jersey his own. One of his trademark free-kicks helped France defeat the Netherlands 2\u20130 in Paris (18 November 1981) in a crucial qualifying match for the 1982 World Cup in Spain.\n\nFrance unexpectedly reached the semifinals of the 1982 World Cup where they met West Germany in Seville for what proved to be one of the greatest matches in World Cup history. German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher had collided with Patrick Battiston, leaving the Frenchman knocked-out cold, and the referee did not call a penalty, much to the anger of the French. With both sides level at 3\u20133 after extra time had been played (Platini having scored France's first goal of the game from a penalty) the match went to a penalty shoot-out which West Germany won 5\u20134.[citation needed]\n\n\"He didn't run a lot like Cruyff and didn't depend on his physique, but I liked how he was the brain organising things on the pitch. He was a player who used his head in the broader sense. The way he shone with France and Juventus, and his capacity for taking free-kicks, made him the European footballer of the 1980s.\"\n\n\u2014Pel\u00e9.[21]\n\nIn 1984, Platini captained France to success in the European Championship on home soil. His individual impact on the tournament was huge with nine of France's 14 goals in just five games (the top goal scorer in Euro '84).\n\nHe scored the winner in France's opening match against Denmark, and scored one \"perfect\" hat-trick against Belgium  as France topped their first-round group with three wins out of three. In the dramatic semi-final in Marseille against Portugal, Platini scored the final goal of the match for a memorable 3\u20132 win in the last minute of extra time.\n\nIn the final against Spain at the Princes Stadium in Paris, he opened the scoring with a free kick-goal, helped by a monumental blunder from Spain goalkeeper Luis Arconada. A second goal from Bruno Bellone in injury time at the end of the match secured France's first major title in international football.\n\nSuffering from groin pain and playing under injection, Platini was not in peak physical condition for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Nonetheless, he contributed two important goals. The first contributed to their 2\u20130 defeat of defending champions Italy at the Olimpico Stadium in Mexico City. The second came during the quarter-final match against Brazil in Guadalajara. After Careca scored for Brazil, Platini scored the equalizer, his 41st on his 31st birthday, which sent the game into a penalty shoot-out. France won 4\u20133, with Platini infamously sending his over the bar. This goal was to be the last of his international career. After losing a second World Cup semi-final in a row to West Germany in Guadalajara, France had to settle for third place. Platini did not take part in the 1982 or 1986 World Cup third-place matches.\n\n\"When I was a kid and played with my friends, I always chose to be Platini. I let my friends share the names of my other idols between themselves.\"\n\n\u2014Zinedine Zidane[21]\n\nPlatini made his last appearance for France on 29 April 1987, in a European Championship qualifier at home to Iceland, a few weeks before announcing his retirement from all football. In 72 appearances for France from 1976 to 1987, including 49 appearances as captain, Platini scored 41 times, a record for the French national team, which has since only been surpassed by two men: Thierry Henry, after scoring his 42nd and 43rd national team goals against Lithuania in a Euro 2008 qualifying match on 17 October 2007, and Olivier Giroud, who scored his 41st and 42nd goals for France in a 7\u20131 friendly victory over Ukraine on 7 October 2020.\n\nPlatini's last match came on 27 November 1988, when he came out of retirement for one day to play in an international friendly match representing Kuwait against the Soviet Union, at the request of the Kuwaiti Emir. Platini played a total of 21 minutes in the 2\u20130 loss to the Soviets. In doing so, Platini completed the rare feat of appearing for more than one country at full international level.[4]\n\n\"Michel was one of those great players who saw fitness work as being a bit superficial. He used to say, 'We're not going to compete in the 5,000 metres at the Olympics, we have to play with our feet.\"\n\n\u2014Giovanni Trapattoni, Juventus coach.[21]\n\nPlatini is considered to be one of the greatest players of all time, and is regarded as one of the finest passers in football history, as well as one of the best ever penalty kick and free kick specialists to have played the game.[8][12][21][22][23][24] A quick, versatile, elegant, and intelligent offensive midfield playmaker, with a unique ability to read the game and bend the ball from set pieces, he was renowned in particular for his ball control, technical ability, dribbling skills, creativity, range of passing, and vision, despite his lack of notable physical or athletic attributes.[8][21][25][26][27][28][29]\n\nAlthough he primarily served as a creative midfielder, who operated in a more withdrawn playing role behind the strikers, and who mainly orchestrated attacking plays, provided assists, or created chances for teammates, Platini was also a prolific goalscorer. Due to his footballing intelligence, movement, and composure in front of goal, as well as his accurate finishing ability with either foot, as well as his head, despite being naturally right-footed, he was known for his ability to create attacking opportunities for himself by playing exchanges with his teammates until he was in a position from which he could receive the ball and score; indeed, he won several top-scoring awards throughout his career, both at club and international level, and is considered by pundits to be one of the best finishers of all time.[8][12][20][30][31]\n\nWhen taking free kicks, Platini usually preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick which had not been touched by a teammate first; his unique free kick technique, which often involved him hitting the ball over the wall, influenced many other specialists, such as Alessandro Del Piero,[23][32] and Andrea Pirlo.[33] Despite his talent, skill, and outstanding playing ability, Platini also drew criticism from his managers at times, due to his lack of stamina and poor defensive work-rate.[21] Due to his leadership, dominance, and his technical, offensive, and creative attributes, as well as his ability to be a decisive player for his teams, he was given the nickname \"Le Roi\" (\"The King\", in French).[25][28][34] Moreover, Platini was known for his discipline on the pitch; indeed, in his extensive career, he was never sent off.[35]\n\nMichel Platini's life and work are presented through an impressively extensive collection of sporting exhibits, honoured with two Guinness World Records, at the Michel Platini Museum located in the village of Mosfiloti, Cyprus.[36]\n\nPlatini was named coach of the French national side on 1 November 1988, replacing Henri Michel, who had been forced out after France infamously drew with Cyprus (1\u20131) in a 1990 World Cup qualifier. France's qualifying campaign was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nThe focus of the team shifted to qualifying for the 1992 European Championship in Sweden. France excelled in the qualifying stages, winning all eight of their group matches, including notable victories away to Spain and Czechoslovakia. After a record 19-match unbeaten run, they were among the favourites to win the competition and Platini was named Manager of the Year by the World Soccer Awards. But a string of uninspiring performances in warm-up matches, followed by France's first-round elimination from the tournament, led Platini to step down as coach.\n\n\"He [Platini] was a great player who left a mark on his era, and it's always good when players take up positions in the higher echelons of the game. He knows everything there is to know about football.\"\n\n\u2014Lilian Thuram, France '98 World Cup winning  defender.[21]\n\nPlatini was, along with Fernand Sastre, head of the organizing committee for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, held in France. He served on the UEFA Technical Development Committee from 1988 to 1990. He has been a member of the UEFA Executive Committee and European member of the FIFA Executive Committee since 2002. He continued to climb the ranks of UEFA and FIFA football administration and in 2006, became a chairman of the FIFA Technical and Development Committee, while also being vice-president of the French Football Federation.\n\nPlatini confirmed that he would run for the UEFA presidency in July 2006.[37] In the election in D\u00fcsseldorf on 26 January 2007, he defeated Lennart Johansson, who held the post for the previous 16 years, by 27 votes to 23.[38] Platini based his speech on virtues of solidarity and universality.\n\nPlatini has recently[when?] backed the 6+5 idea, six home-grown players and five foreign players to be introduced in top-flight teams in Europe. Platini has also backed caps on wages, transfer spending \u2013 both absolute and as a fraction of club turnover \u2013 and foreign ownership of clubs. He has stated that he wants to reduce the number of Italian, Spanish, and English teams that participate in the UEFA Champions League to a maximum of three instead of four.[39] This hasn't happened yet, but instead for the 2009\u201310 season, different routes were created for champions of smaller countries and non-champions of bigger countries. He has also talked about banning clubs from the competition based on the debts of the clubs.[40] Among his more contentious claims is that international transfer of players under 18 is in fact a form of illegal \"child trafficking\" and should be prohibited by the EU. \"Paying a child to kick a ball is not that different from paying a child to work [...] in a factory,\" said Platini to members of the European Parliament on 18 February 2009.[41]\n\nFollowing Sepp Blatter's announcement in June 2015 that he would resign from the post of FIFA president amid the ongoing corruption scandal,[42][43] Platini announced in July that he would run for FIFA president in the 2016 special election.[44] However, on 7 January 2016, Platini announced that he would not be standing in the Fifa presidential election, saying: \"The timing is not good for me. I don't have the means to fight on equal terms with the other candidates. [\u2026] Bye bye Fifa, bye bye Fifa presidency.\"[45]\n\nFollowing the ongoing corruption case, and after his announcement that in July he would run for FIFA president, Platini was also involved himself in the case. Swiss prosecutors accused FIFA president Sepp Blatter of making a \"disloyal payment\" of $2m (\u00a31.6m) to Platini. Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber\u00a0[de], stated: \"We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person.\"[46][47] Both Platini and Blatter were placed under formal investigation by FIFA's independent ethics committee in late September 2015.[48]\n\nOn 8 October 2015, Platini was provisionally suspended until 6 January 2016 from any football-related activity.[49] On 21 December, Platini and Blatter were both found guilty of ethics violations and barred from the sport until 2023.[7] The committee said Platini \"did not show commitment to an ethical attitude\" and lacked respect for laws and regulations of the organization.[50][51] Platini boycotted the hearing, and said he planned to appeal the decision, declaring himself \"at peace with my conscience.\"[52][53][54][55] He appealed to Swiss courts, and to the European Court of Human Rights, but the courts rejected his appeals.[56]\n\nPlatini was also involved in the Greek public polemica[vague] regarding the 2015 Greek football scandal.[57][58][59]\n\nIn April 2016, Platini has been named in the Panama Papers.[60]\n\nOn 18 May 2018, Platini said that the 1998 FIFA World Cup draw was fixed to ensure France and Brazil could not face each other until the final if both teams won their groups.[61]\n\nIn June 2019, Platini was questioned over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.[62]\n\nOn 9 July 2010, the day before the third place play-off of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Platini collapsed at a restaurant in the Michaelangelo Hotel in Sandton, Johannesburg. He was rushed to the Morningside Medi-Clinic with a suspected heart attack after having received first aid care by a Brazilian radio director who was sitting at a table next to him. He was attended to and discharged by cardiologist and former President of the South African Heart Association \u2013 Dr Leonard Steingo.[63] The official statement released by FIFA confirmed that Platini was discharged, stating that the UEFA President was \"fine, and merely suffering from a bout of flu.\"[64]\nPlatini was confirmed in attendance two days later at the final between Spain and Netherlands on the evening of 11 July.\n\nNancy\n\nSaint-\u00c9tienne\n\nJuventus\n\nFrance\n\nIndividual\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Platini"}, {"id": 154, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Ibrahima Tour\u00e9", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/ibrahima-tour\u00e9/9470903", "desc": "Ibrahima Tour\u00e9 (born 17 December 1985) is a Senegalese footballer who plays as a striker for Gaz\u00e9lec Ajaccio in the Domino's Ligue 2.\nHe also played for Al Nasr , Chengdu Wuniu, Wydad Casablanca, Paykan, Persepolis, Sepahan, Ajman and Monaco.

He was a prolific, record-breaking striker best known for his time with English club Liverpool in the late 1980s. His tally of 330 Football League goals is the sixth-highest in the history of English football.[1]\n\nDuring his early career, he worked his way up through the lower leagues, playing in every league from the old Fourth Division to the old First Division. Initially signed as a replacement for Ian Rush, Aldridge spent over two successful seasons at Liverpool, winning the league and FA Cup once, and narrowly missing out on a second league title. Aldridge spent two seasons at Real Sociedad, becoming the first non-Basque player to sign for the club in several decades as they abandoned their selective recruitment policy. In 1991, he returned to England to play for Tranmere Rovers, becoming their player-manager in 1996. He retired from playing and resigned as manager in 1998 and has not managed since.\n\nA Liverpudlian by birth, he was recruited to play for the Republic of Ireland as part of Jack Charlton's \"Granny Rule\" policy: his great-grandmother was from Athlone, and travelled to Liverpool to settle in the 19th century.[2][3] His career with Ireland coincided with their most successful period in international football, and he played at two World Cups.[4][5]\n\nAldridge took a long time to reach the top level of the English game. He began his career in the mid-1970s at non-league South Liverpool, before getting his break in the professional game when, aged 20, he signed for Newport County in the Fourth Division on 2 May 1979 for \u00a33,500.\n\nWhile at Somerton Park, Aldo, as he came to be known, played 198 times scoring 87 goals, a goal every 2+1\u20444 games, including seven goals in twelve FA Cup matches. He partnered Tommy Tynan and Dave Gwyther for four years at Somerton Park, helping Newport to promotion from the Fourth Division and Welsh Cup glory in his first season, and to reach the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup in his second.\n\nHis first season with County, 1979\u201380, saw him score fourteen goals from 38 games as his side won the Welsh Cup and gained promotion to the Third Division. A year later, he featured in the side that achieved a notable European run. In the league, he scored seven goals in 27 league games. He scored eleven goals in 36 games in the 1981\u201382 season, but in 1982\u201383 he did better still with seventeen goals from 41 games as County narrowly missed out on promotion to the second tier.[6]\n\nIn 1983\u201384, with Tynan having departed, Aldridge had scored 26 times by the end of February, and County were still in the Third Division.[7]\n\nAlridge was sold to[8] Oxford United on 21 March 1984, when the club was preparing for their Third Division promotion run-in under the management of Jim Smith. He made his debut on 7 April 1984, coming on as a substitute in a 1\u20130 win over Walsall at Fellows Park. His first goal was in the 5\u20130 home win against Bolton Wanderers on 20 April 1984.\n\nHe was used sparingly in the run-in to the Third Division title but the following season forged a partnership with Billy Hamilton and became the first Second Division player for nineteen years to score 30 goals. His 34 goals (30 in the league) in 1984\u201385 broke the club's goalscoring record for a single season, [9] as Oxford gained promotion to the old First Division for the first time. Aldridge also picked up a Second Division title medal.\n\nIn his 27th year, Aldridge finally had the chance to play in the First Division. He was the third-highest scorer in the division (only surpassed by Gary Lineker and Frank McAvennie) and netted six goals in United's League Cup-winning run in 1986 which culminated in a 3\u20130 victory over Queens Park Rangers in the final at Wembley. This is Oxford's only major trophy to date. His 23 goals from 39 games also assisted in Oxford avoiding relegation.\n\nAldridge ended up playing 141 times for Oxford, scoring 90 goals[8]\u00a0\u2013 a goal every 1.5 games\u00a0\u2013 including fourteen League Cup goals in 17 ties. He scored four goals against Gillingham in the League Cup on 24 September 1986 and three hat-tricks, the first in the 5\u20132 victory over Leeds United on 24 November 1984. He also scored one of the two Oxford goals that defeated Manchester United in Alex Ferguson's first game as manager, on 8 November 1986, maintaining his fine form into the 1986\u201387 season.[10]\n\nIn early 1987, Liverpool were losing striker Ian Rush to Juventus at the end of the 1986\u201387 season and needed a proven and experienced replacement. He signed for Kenny Dalglish's side on 27 January 1987 for \u00a3750,000 and was initially used as a partner for Rush (filling a position previously occupied by player-manager Dalglish and fellow striker Paul Walsh) and as an occasional substitute. Dalglish had been interested in signing a number of other strikers, including Chelsea's David Speedie and Arsenal's Charlie Nicholas, for a number of months before settling on Aldridge.[11]\n\nLiverpool ended the season trophyless, including a Wembley defeat to Arsenal in the League Cup final, for which Aldridge was ineligible. By the time of his transfer to Liverpool in that 1986\u201387 league campaign, Aldridge had already scored fifteen goals for Oxford in the space of 25 games.[6]\n\nAldridge made his debut for the Reds on 21 February 1987, when he came on as a 46th-minute substitute for Craig Johnston in a 2\u20132 league draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park.[12] His first goal for his new club came a week later on 28 February, in the 60th minute, the only goal of the game as Liverpool beat Southampton in a league match at Anfield.[13]\n\nAldridge scored 26 goals in what turned out to be a successful season for Liverpool, including a strike in each of the first nine games, forming a 10-match scoring run as he had scored in his final league appearance of the previous season.[14]\n\nHe linked up with new signings Peter Beardsley and John Barnes as Liverpool lost only twice in the League championship season and went unbeaten for the first 29 matches. Liverpool won the 1988 league title with two defeats all season and a nine-point lead over their nearest rivals Manchester United, although the gap between Liverpool and their nearest contenders was considerably wider for much of the season.\n\nAldridge scored both goals in the club's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.[15] With Wimbledon 1\u20130 up in the FA Cup final at Wembley, midway through the second half Liverpool were awarded a spot-kick when Aldridge himself was fouled, and he took the resulting penalty. Aldridge had scored all eleven of his penalty kicks that season, but goalkeeper Dave Beasant noticed that he always placed the ball to the keeper's left. Aldridge did, as predicted, place the penalty to Beasant's left, and the keeper sprang across to save it.[16] He became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in a Wembley FA Cup final. Aldridge's failure was his first penalty miss for Liverpool. He was substituted shortly afterwards as Liverpool lost 1\u20130.\n\nThe following season was tough and eventful for Aldridge. Rush failed to settle in Italy and Liverpool paid \u00a32.8 million to bring him back to Anfield just before the season kicked off. Kenny Dalglish played Aldridge and Rush together. It was Aldridge who enjoyed the better form during the season, with Rush being hindered by injuries. In the Charity Shield match against Wimbledon at Wembley, Aldridge started the match and scoring both Liverpool goals in a 2\u20131 win. Aldridge maintained his scoring streak, often playing alongside both Rush and Beardsley in attack, while Rush missed a number of games or started games on the bench due to injuries. In the first league game of the season a week later, Aldridge scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win at Charlton Athletic.[17] He scored another league hat-trick on 14 March, in the 5\u20130 home win over Luton Town, which took his league tally for the season to fifteen goals. He reached the twenty-goal mark on 13 May in a 2\u20131 win at Wimbledon, and finished the season as the club's top scorer with 22 goals in the league, eight in the FA Cup, two in the League Cup, and two in the Charity Shield, amounting to 34 in all competitions.[17]\n\nIn the 1989 FA Cup final at Wembley, against Merseyside rivals Everton, Aldridge made up for his penalty failure a year earlier by scoring after four minutes with his first touch of the ball. Substitute Ian Rish, who replaced Aldridge, scored twice in extra time to earn Liverpool a 3\u20132 victory. Aldridge scored 21 league goals that season, and 31 in all competitions, putting him among the highest scorers in the first division that season. The League and FA Cup \"double\", achieved by Liverpool in 1986 but denied to them by Wimbledon in 1988, was again possible, with a decider against Arsenal to come at Anfield. Aldridge played in a game which would guarantee Liverpool the title as long as Arsenal failed to win by two clear goals. 1\u20130 down in injury time, Liverpool conceded another goal to Michael Thomas with virtually the last kick of the season, thus losing the League title.\n\nAldridge played 104 times for Liverpool, scoring 63 goals, 50 of them in the league.[18]\n\nThe following 1989\u201390 season, Kenny Dalglish reverted to a 4\u20134\u20132 formation with Rush and Beardsley as first-choice strikers; however, the club accepted an offer of \u00a31 million from La Liga side Real Sociedad in early September 1989, with Aldridge having played twice in the league for Liverpool that season.\n\nThis transfer made Aldridge the first non-Basque player to sign for Sociedad in several decades as they abandoned a selective recruitment policy.[8][19][20] Before he left Liverpool, he was given a special run-out as a substitute during the club's record-shattering 9\u20130 win over Crystal Palace in order to score a penalty in front of the Kop. He threw his shirt and boots into the crowd at the end and signed for Real Sociedad the next day on 13 September 1989.[citation needed]\n\nAldridge scored 40 goals in 75 appearances for Sociedad over two seasons,[19] with the club encouraged to make more signings from English football in 1990, namely Dalian Atkinson and Kevin Richardson. Despite his success, some Sociedad fans initially did not accept him because he was a foreigner. Insulting graffiti was written on the stadium, a fan spat on the ground when Aldridge passed in the street, and his family found it hard to adapt to the different lifestyle in the Basque country.[21] Aldridge handed in a transfer request in 1991 to the newly appointed manager John Toshack \u2013 another former Liverpool striker.[22]\n\nAldridge returned to Merseyside on 11 July 1991 with Tranmere Rovers, in a \u00a3250,000 deal. While there he scored a club-record 40 goals in his first season at Prenton Park \u2013 scoring his 40th goal against former club Oxford United. Tranmere, who were playing in the Second Division for the first time in more than fifty years, achieved a mid-table finish in the league.\n\nHe made his debut for Rovers, aged 32, on 17 August 1991, scoring both the goals in a 2\u20130 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion at the Goldstone Ground. In seven years as a Tranmere player, he amassed a total of 294 appearances, scoring 174 goals, an average of one goal every 1.7 games, including 22 goals from 25 League Cup ties. Aldridge retired at the end of the 1997\u201398 season, scoring a brace in his final game as a professional against Wolverhampton Wanderers.[23]\n\nAldridge's goals helped Tranmere reach their highest position ever in the league \u2013 top-six finishes in the second tier in 1993, 1994 and 1995 \u2013 which delivered playoff places each time, but all of them ended in semi-final defeats. He also came close to winning another major trophy as Rovers took Aston Villa to a penalty shoot-out in the 1993\u201394 League Cup semi-finals before bowing out to the eventual competition winners.\n\nDuring his career in England alone, Aldridge played 739 games, scoring 411 times \u2013 an average of one goal every 1.8 games.\n\nOn 12 March 1996, with the resignation of John King after nine years as manager, Aldridge became player-manager of Tranmere, before finally giving up playing and concentrating on the management side two years later. In his first season in charge, Rovers finished the 1995\u201396 season in thirteenth place in Division One.[24]\n\nUnder Aldridge, Tranmere reached the 2000 Football League Cup Final (which they lost to Leicester City) and consecutive FA Cup quarter-finals in 2000 and 2001. During the 2000 League Cup Final, Aldridge slapped the face of Leicester's Theo Zagorakis after he applauded the referee's decision to send off Clint Hill.[25] The slap was seen by FA officials and he was charged with misconduct.[26] Aldridge said of incident: \"I felt he [Zagorakis] had disrespected Clint on one of the biggest occasions of his career so I slapped him\".[25] Tranmere were relegated into English football's third tier in 2001. Aldridge resigned in March 2001, just before Rovers' fate was sealed.[27]\n\nAldridge had already been recruited to play for the Republic of Ireland by the time he was approached by Liverpool at the start of 1987, qualifying through his grandmother, who was from Athlone.[28] (When the Football Association of Ireland came looking for him they found out that Ray Houghton, who also played for Oxford at the time, was also eligible.) He made his debut on 26 March 1986 against Wales at Lansdowne Road in a 1\u20130 defeat.[29] The match was the first under new manager Jack Charlton.\n\nThat summer, Aldridge played for the Irish side which had qualified, under Jack Charlton, for Euro 88 in West Germany, their first-ever major finals. They duly beat England 1\u20130, and drew 1\u20131 with the USSR, but went out of the competition after a defeat by eventual champions the Netherlands.[30]\t\nAldridge was struggling at international level at this time \u2013 he was playing well as a team performer, and Charlton was never unhappy, but it took him 20 matches to score his first international goal, which came against Tunisia at Lansdowne Road on 19 October 1988.[31]\n\nAldridge withdrew himself from Ireland's World Cup qualifying tie with Spain at Lansdowne Road on 26 April 1989, as he felt unable to participate in the game due to his grief over the Hillsborough disaster.[32] The game ended in a 1\u20130 win for Ireland.[33] Aldridge finally scored his first goals at competitive level when he scored twice in a 2\u20130 win away over Malta, which sealed Ireland's qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAldridge played a crucial role in Ireland's path to the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. Though he had finally opened his goal account for his country, he failed to score at the World Cup (although he had a goal disallowed in a 1\u20131 draw with the Netherlands) and Ireland lost to the host nation in the last eight. Aldridge played every game but was substituted in all of his five appearances.\n\nIreland failed to qualify for Euro 92, despite going through their group unbeaten. Aldridge scored three times in qualification, all 3 goals coming in Ireland's opening 5\u20130 win over Turkey at Lansdowne Road. Despite this setback, Aldridge helped Ireland to qualify for the 1994 World Cup: he scored 6 times in qualifying including a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win over Latvia.\n\nAldridge's international career with Ireland is also remembered for an off-pitch incident at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Trailing 2\u20130 to Mexico in a group game in Orlando, Florida, manager Charlton tried to send Aldridge on as a substitute but was delayed by a perceived sluggishness from the officials. Manager and player both launched expletive-laden tirades which were clearly heard by television viewers, with Aldridge having to be restrained from attacking the 4th official and a FIFA representative. Both were punished after the game, but when Aldridge finally was allowed on, after 6 full minutes of trying, he scored a goal to give Ireland a chance to get back into the game. Despite losing the game 2\u20131, Aldridge's goal was crucial in securing qualification for the second round.[34]\nAll four teams in the group had finished with the same number of points and the same goal difference, Ireland's qualification was at the expense of Norway who had scored just one goal fewer.\n\nAldridge continued to play for Ireland in the qualifying stages of Euro 96. Despite a strong start to the group, Ireland failed to qualify. Aldridge scored twice in a 3\u20130 win away to Latvia in Ireland's opening game and was also on the scoresheet in a 4\u20130 away win against Northern Ireland. In Ireland's final home game of the group Aldridge scored twice against Latvia in a 2\u20131 win but Ireland failed to qualify after finishing second and losing a subsequent playoff to the Netherlands at Anfield in December 1995. Aldridge at this time was one goal short of the 20-goal record held by Frank Stapleton but, despite playing in the early stages of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, he failed to score again to match the record and retired in 1996 to concentrate on managing Tranmere Rovers. His final game was a 3\u20130 against Macedonia on 9 October 1996 when he came on as a substitute.\n\nOverall, Aldridge scored 19 goals in 69 matches spanning over a decade; 8 of his 19 goals came against Latvia.\n\nAldridge is now a pundit with various media organisations \u2013 most notably with Radio City 96.7 where he summarises on the station's Liverpool commentaries home and away. He also continues to play in the Liverpool veterans' team. In 1998, he asked Hyder Jawad to ghost-write his autobiography. John Aldridge: My Story was published by Hodder & Stoughton the year after.\n\nIn 2006, he gained media celebrity in Ireland by appearing in RT\u00c9's Charity You're A Star competition. Despite not having a natural singing voice, Aldridge won the competition and in the process raised money for his nominated charity Temple Street Children's Hospital.[35]\n\nAldridge was a crowd favourite everywhere he went, especially on Merseyside where being a local lad helped his cause. This was confirmed when a poll conducted by the official Liverpool Football Club website during the summer of 2006 placed him in 26th position. 110,000 Liverpool supporters worldwide took part in the poll named '100 Players Who Shook The Kop', where they were asked to name their favourite Reds of all time.\n\nIn March 2008, Aldridge took part in the autobiography audio CD series 60 minutes with John Aldridge. He spoke in depth about his career with 60 minutes presenter David Knight and later took part in a major signing session, signing 2000 copies of the CD in support of the Everyman appeal charity.[36]\n\nJohn Aldridge was allegedly involved in the News of the World hacking scandal in the mid-2000s. \"They tell me I was hacked five or six years ago. I have no idea why they should go after me. I'm not exactly high profile.\"[37]\n\nAldridge opened a Twitter account in March 2011. However, he was soon involved in angry exchanges with Manchester United supporters after referring to them as \"scum\",[38] and eventually closed his account. A year later he revealed that he had returned to the site.[39]\n\nHe is a regular contributor to match analysis and phone-in shows on LFC TV and also writes a column for the Sunday World and the Liverpool Echo.[citation needed]\n\nWhen 96 Liverpool away fans were crushed to death in the Hillsborough disaster of 15 April 1989, during an FA Cup tie held in Sheffield against Nottingham Forest, Aldridge, as a native Liverpudlian and boyhood supporter of the club, was deeply affected by the tragedy. He attended the funerals of many of the victims, gave support to the injured and the bereaved, and publicly contemplated giving up the game.[citation needed]\n\nNewport County\n\nOxford United\n\nLiverpool\n\nTranmere Rovers\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aldridge"}, {"id": 156, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/70/1388910/original/konstantinos-chalkias-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Kostas Chalkias", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/konstantinos-chalkias/1388910", "desc": "Konstantinos \"Kostas\" Chalkias (Greek: \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \"\u039a\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2\" \u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2; born 30 May 1974) is a retired Greek footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

He also was selected at the next two European Championships and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nChalkias started his career in the Panathinaikos youth academy in the 1994\u201395 double winning team. He was transferred to feeder club Apollon Athens in 1996 as a replacement for retired Antonis Minou, signing a five-year professional contract.[2] His solid performances helped Apollon avoid relegation from Alpha Ethniki[3] and made him return to Panathinaikos two years later, in 1998.[4] However, he did not get any playing time at Panathinaikos by his head coach Vasilis Daniil and in January 1999 he was re-sent to Apollon on loan for six months.[3][5] After his return, he was forced to play third keeper to the legendary Jozef Wandzik and Greek legend Antonis Nikopolidis. He made a total of 25 starts over the next three years between 1998 and 2001 for Panathinaikos and was transferred for two seasons to Iraklis before good performances led to a return to Panathinaikos in the 2003\u201304 season. After playing second fiddle again to Nikopolidis during most of the 2003\u201304 season, he was allowed back into the first team after a dispute Nikopolidis had with management.\n\nAt the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Nikopolidis was let out on a free transfer to bitter rivals, Olympiakos, and a new keeper was bought, Mario Galinovic. After a fight for first team football, eventually Galinovic won out and due to overseas interest, Chalkias was shipped out to English side Portsmouth F.C. in January 2005, making his debut in the FA Cup fourth round tie away at fierce rivals Southampton.[6] Over the next few matches Chalkias's wild tactics and inconsistency led to some poorly conceded goals, and he was soon dropped and replaced by Jamie Ashdown. With the signing of Sander Westerveld in July 2005, Chalkias fell even further down the pecking order, and in January 2006 he left Portsmouth by mutual consent, having made only five league appearances for the club.[7] Shortly after his release from Portsmouth he joined Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side Real Murcia.[8]\n\nChalkias was bought in the summer transfer window of 2006 by Aris Thessaloniki, who were then newly promoted to the Greek Superleague.[9] After his transfer to Aris, Chalkias regained some of the form that he showed during his bright run in the first team for Panathinaikos and after an exceptional season, he was recalled \u03c4\u03bf the national team and gained a starting spot over Antonis Nikopolidis after the latter's poor performance earlier in a Euro 2008 qualifying match against Turkey.[10]\n\nChalkias left Aris in late May 2008 after his contract was due to run out[11] and on 28 May 2008 he agreed to sign a two-year contract for rivals PAOK,[12] thus becoming the third player to have played for the all three major clubs of Thessaloniki (Iraklis, Aris, PAOK) following Apostolos Tsourelas and Stefanos Borbokis.[11]\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season he reached the second position with PAOK and the semifinal of the Greek cup. In January 2010 he renewed his contract with PAOK for two more years. Chalkias has contributed to the qualification of PAOK the 2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round, after winning the preliminaries against AEK Athens, Olympiakos and Aris Thessaloniki F.C.\n\nOn 22 September 2012, Chalkias announced his retirement from football.[13]\n\nAfter four years of inactivity, he returned to the football for the Greek team Panachaiki.[14]\n\nChalkias made his debut on 10 November 2001, in a friendly 4\u20132 home win against Estonia, as he replaced Antonis Nikopolidis at half time.[15] In the summer 2004 he was part of the squad which won Euro 2004, although he was only the reserve 'keeper.[7] Otto Rehhagel called him also for the qualification of Euro 2008. Chalkias played as the first goalkeeper for the Greece national team during most of the qualification for the World Cup 2010, after the retirement of the legendary goalkeeper Antonis Nikopolidis and he is the only goalkeeper from the Euro 2004.[16]\n\nIn Euro 2012 Chalkias was the oldest player at the tournament at 38 years of age and one of just three players remaining from the victorious 2004 Greek squad.[17] On 12 June 2012, he started the second group stage match against Czech Republic \u2013 at the 21st minute of the match, and having conceded two goals in 6 minutes, he was substituted with Michalis Sifakis due to injury.[18] After Greece's lost quarterfinal to Germany on 22 June, a game which Chalkias watched from the bench, he announced his withdrawal from the national team alongside Nikos Liberopoulos.[19]\n\nNotes\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostas_Chalkias"}, {"id": 157, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/64/1271359/original/jason-akermanis-athletes-photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Jason Akermanis", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/jason-akermanis/1271359", "desc": "Jason Dean Akermanis (born 24 February 1977) is a former Australian rules football player. He is a Brownlow Medallist and triple premiership player who played for the Brisbane Bears, Brisbane Lions and Western Bulldogs.", "full_desc": "\n\nJason Dean Akermanis (born 24 February 1977) is a former professional Australian rules football player who played in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is a Brownlow Medallist and triple premiership player who played for the Brisbane Bears, Brisbane Lions and Western Bulldogs.[2]\n\nAkermanis was born in Mildura, Victoria to a Canadian father John Akermanis, and an Australian mother Shona Carswell,[3] but moved to Brisbane at 9 years of age.[4] Upon arriving in Queensland in 1986, Akermanis signed up to play for the Mayne under-10s side.[5]\n\nWhen he was 13, Akermanis discovered that he was not the son of his mother's former partner, John Akermanis. His biological father was Denis Dezdjek, a mechanic from Mildura who his mother had an affair with.[6] He was educated at Wavell State High School then at St. Joseph's Nudgee College and played football with the Mayne Football Club in the QAFL where he was spotted by Brisbane Bears talent scouts. He completed year 12 at high school in 1995, during his first year with the Brisbane Bears.\n\nAkermanis was a solid contributor to the Brisbane Bears midfield (wing), with his pace and skills evident even early in his career.[citation needed]\n\nAkermanis made his debut in Round 4 of the 1995 AFL season, he had a solid debut, accumulating 19 disposals and kicking 1 goal in the Bears loss to Carlton. He played a total of 17 games in this debut season and kicking 12 goals.\n\nThe 1996 AFL season saw Akermanis play 21 games and kick 32 goals for the season, he doubled his disposal count from the previous season to finish with 328 total disposals for the season. His season was highlighted with a 19 disposal & 6 goal effort against the West Coast Eagles in Round 17.[7]\n\nIt was after the Brisbane Lions formed that he began to shine, bulking up significantly, and a move to the forward line enabled him to make the most of his opportunities and develop a reputation as a goal sneak.\nAkermanis played 34 games across the 1997-98 seasons and tallied 532 disposals and 32 goals.\n\n1999 AFL season saw Akermanis have a breakout year, winning the Merrett\u2013Murray Medal as Brisbane's Best & Fairest player for the season. Jason gathered 469 disposals and booted 16 goals for the season.\n\nAkermanis became one of the Brisbane Lions' most talented players. His flamboyant talents and bleached-blond hair and contrasting black beard make him easy to identify on the field. At the Lions he made his name as a speedy midfielder or on-baller with blistering acceleration and an uncanny ability to kick exceptionally well with either foot, talents which helped him win the AFL's Brownlow Medal in 2001 in which he polled 23 votes to beat Adelaide's Andrew McLeod. The 2001 season saw Jason tally 510 disposals and kick 28 goals for the season, ultimately capping off a magnificent week/season, finishing as a premiership player.\n\nThe 2002 AFL season saw Akermanis impact the scoreboard by kicking 49 goals for the season, and becoming a premiership player again, as the Brisbane Lions defeated Collingwood in the decider. Akermanis played with a torn right adductor, in which he suffered early in the first quarter, this effected his ability to kick with his dominant right foot, resulting in Jason kicking on his left foot for the majority of the game, he eventually kicked a left foot snap over his shoulder late in the last quarter in which would be the sealer, guiding the Lions to victory.\n\nAkermanis is also known for his goal-scoring abilities. He was a winner of the AFL Goal of the Year 2002 award and had an ability to kick goals from acute angles. In a match in 2005, he kicked two goals within minutes of each other from almost exactly the same spot: deep in the right forward pocket on the run. Early in the 2006 season, Akermanis was dropped from the Brisbane Lions side for Round 7, playing a game with the Suncoast Lions. This coincided with inflammatory comments that he made about the coach, Leigh Matthews, during the week, and there was speculation that his time at the club was up only a few months after he had won the 2005 club best and fairest award. However, Akermanis was soon recalled to the side and responded with 22 disposals across half-back in the game against Port Adelaide, and a post-match interview with Channel Nine showed him smiling and visibly happy with his performance. On 27 July 2006 it was reported that the coaching panel and senior playing group had voted unanimously (12\u20130) to not allow him back into the club.[citation needed]\n\nOn 6 September, it was reported that the Western Bulldogs were leading in the race to sign Akermanis for the 2007 season. On 15 September, Akermanis confirmed that he wanted to join the Bulldogs. It was then down to the Lions agreeing on the trade price, which they did on 9 October, when Brisbane Lions football manager Graeme Allan announced that the team had agreed to trade Akermanis to the Bulldogs.\n\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Akermanis made a statement that he would retire at the end of 2009 when his three-year contract expired, however he displayed excellent form at the start of the 2009 season, and later retracted his earlier comment about retirement. Western Bulldogs coach Rodney Eade said he had not ruled out the possibility of extending Akermanis's contract depending on his performance for the rest of the season.[8] He then signed with the Bulldogs for another year, hoping to play in a fourth premiership side. It is assumed his contract would be for substantially less pay than his previous deal, which is estimated at between $350,000 and $400,000 a year.[9]\n\nIn July 2010 it was announced that the Western Bulldogs had terminated Akermanis' contract due to the club's judgement that the two were on different paths.[10] At the time of his sacking, he was one of only two former Brisbane Bears players left in the AFL, with the other being Daniel Bradshaw. He and Bradshaw were also the last remaining members of the Brisbane Lions inaugural 1997 list.\n\nAkermanis began playing with the Glenorchy Football Club in the Tasmanian State League in 2011[11] as well as playing a number of one-off games at various country clubs. In 2013, he became captain-coach of the North Albury Football Club in the Ovens & Murray Football League.[12]\n\nAkermanis threatened to switch codes to rugby union in 2002 if Brisbane signed former Kangaroos Football Club star Wayne Carey,[13] and leaked to the media that teammate Nigel Lappin had broken his ribs during the 2003 preliminary final against Sydney.[14]\n\nIn 2007, Akermanis wrote a column about performance-enhancing drugs and his views on their presence in sport, which included comments that he believed a specific opposing player, whom he did not name, had been using the drugs based on how strong a runner the player was for his size. The Seven Network and Fairfax Media inferred and named the player as the West Coast Eagles' Michael Braun, damaging Braun's reputation and subjecting him to an investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, which cleared him of wrongdoing.[15] Braun was ultimately awarded defamation damages against Seven and Fairfax, and received an apology from Akermanis, who conceded that he had been referring to Braun, and admitted that he had been wrong.[16]\n\nIn a May 2010 column, he wrote about homosexuality in sports, and expressed an opinion that he believed homosexual players should stay in the closet, as he did not believe football culture was at that time ready to fully accept them.[17] Numerous people spoke out against his column,[18] and the Western Bulldogs, who were worried about the negative publicity, suspended him for two matches for not having the column approved by the club before having it published.[19] Akermanis would later be dismissed by the Western Bulldogs two months later, partly related to leaking confidential team information to the media as part of a media career which the Bulldogs believed was taking an undue amount of his focus.[10]\n\nIn a radio interview shortly after the death of former Melbourne Football Club player and president Jim Stynes in 2012, Akermanis commented that Stynes was \"a nasty man in his day\", was treated as a \"demi-god\", and questioned his deservedness to receive a state funeral just two days after Stynes' death.[20]\n\nIn October 2014, Akermanis was suspended for four matches as head coach of the North Albury Football Club after being found guilty of breaching the AFL Victoria cyber-bullying policy in regards to several umpires' decisions during the 2014 Ovens & Murray Football League season.[21]\n\nBy 2019, Akermanis had reportedly been banned by three golf clubs for alleged cheating incidents. Akermanis denied the clubs\u2019 claims.[22]\n\nAkermanis is married to Megan Legge, a speech pathologist. They have three daughters. Akermanis learned Auslan to communicate with his wife's hearing-impaired parents.[23] He also speaks Spanish.[24]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Akermanis"}, {"id": 158, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/72/1433655/original/leonel-lvarez-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Leonel \u00c1lvarez", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/leonel-\u00e1lvarez/1433655", "desc": "Leonel \u00c1lvarez may refer to:\n\nLeonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1965), Colombian footballer\nLeonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1995), Argentine footballer\nLeonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1996), Argentine footballer", "full_desc": "Leonel \u00c1lvarez may refer to:\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonel_%C3%81lvarez"}, {"id": 159, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Kriszti\u00e1n Tim\u00e1r", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/kriszti\u00e1n-tim\u00e1r/7231443", "desc": "Kriszti\u00e1n T\u00edm\u00e1r (born 4 October 1979) is a retired Hungarian footballer who played as a Centre back.

In early January 2007 his form for them attracted interest from Plymouth Argyle and he signed on loan for the Pilgrims for the remainder of the 2006\u201307 season, with compatriot P\u00e9ter Halmosi.[4] He made a great start to his loan period with a debut goal in the 2\u20132 draw with Wolves at Molineux.[5]\n\nThe duo impressed and they both joined the club permanently in May 2007.[6] During his time with the club Tim\u00e1r has built up a cult following, with his no-nonsense approach and 100% commitment endearing him greatly to the Argyle supporters who nicknamed him \"The Beast\" or \"The Timarnator\". Tim\u00e1r was voted as the club's Player of the Year for the 2007\u201308 season in April 2008 before he suffered an horrific head injury in the final game of the season at Wolves.[7] He signed a new three-year contract, with the option of a fourth, in July 2008.[8]\n\nUpon his return he endured a frustrating 2008\u201309 season, losing his place in the team to Craig Cathcart. He made just 22 appearances, with 8 of them coming as a substitute, which prompted then manager Paul Sturrock to challenge him to put the season behind him and rediscover his form of 2007\u201308.[9] He began the 2009\u201310 season strongly with a goal against Crystal Palace but soon found himself out of the team again, and upon the opening of the January transfer window he was sent out on-loan to Oldham Athletic for a month by Paul Mariner in order to gain first-team football.[10]\n\nIn December 2011, Tim\u00e1r signed with Vietnamese V-League club SHB \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng and V-league 2012 Champion .[11]\n\nTim\u00e1r represented his country at youth level and was called up to the Hungarian senior team for the first time in March 2008 for the match against Slovenia.[12] He made his long-awaited full international debut in that game as part of the starting eleven.

However, he was mostly back-up for Spanish international Andoni Zubizarreta during his first years; he did manage to feature in the 1990\u201391 European Cup Winners' Cup final in a 1\u20132 loss against Manchester United, with two goals from Mark Hughes.[6]\n\nBusquets totalled 69 league matches in two seasons after Zubizarreta left for Valencia CF,[7] and was also on goal in the 4\u20130 thrashing of Manchester United in the group stage of 1994\u201395's UEFA Champions League,[8] but during this period Bar\u00e7a failed to win any silverware. The following campaigns he was again second choice, first to Portugal's V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda then Dutchman Ruud Hesp, and also clashed with new manager Louis van Gaal.[9]\n\nUntil his retirement in October 2002, Busquets played a further four seasons with neighbouring UE Lleida, spending two apiece in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B.[10] He joined Barcelona's coaching staff afterwards, and worked with the goalkeepers.[11][12]\n\nOriginally a forward at the start of his career until he had to replace an injured goalkeeper, Busquets notably excelled in footplay. Branded by French newspaper L'\u00c9quipe as the goalkeeper with no hands,[13] he has been considered a forefather of this type of play.[14] His style was dismissed by some as less suitable for football than for handball.[15]\n\nBusquets' reputation of being nearly unbeatable in these situations tended to be overshadowed by his occasional baffling blunders.[13][16] However, he was able to keep the number of goals he conceded below the number of games he played in 1995\u201396, his final season as Barcelona's first choice, and retrospectively Johan Cruyff considered him one of the club's most secure goalkeepers in the modern era.[17]\n\nBusquets wore tracksuit trousers instead of shorts while playing, even during hot weather. This piqued the attention of the public to the extent that some fans speculated that he was trying to hide a scar, burn or tattoo.[15] He explained that after getting used to wear them in training he decided to use them in matches as well, as he felt safer from knee injuries that way.[18]\n\nBusquets' son, Sergio,[19] also a product of Barcelona's youth system, was promoted to the main squad for 2008\u201309, playing as a defensive midfielder.

Playing as a striker, Larsson began his career with H\u00f6gaborgs BK. In 1992, he moved to Helsingborg IF where in his first season his partnership up front with Mats Magnusson helped the club win promotion to Allsvenskan after 24 seasons in the lower tiers. He moved to Feyenoord in November 1993, staying for four years before leaving in 1997. During his time in the Dutch Eredivisie, he won two KNVB Cups with Feyenoord. He also broke into the Swedish national football team, and helped them finish in third place at the 1994 World Cup.\n\nOften regarded as the greatest foreign import in Scottish football history,[2] Wim Jansen signed Larsson for Scottish club Celtic in July 1997 for a fee of \u00a3650,000. In his first season at the club, he played a crucial role in Celtic winning their first league title in ten years. He suffered a broken leg in a UEFA Cup tie against Lyon in 1999. Larsson came back stronger, scoring 53 goals in a 2000\u201301 season that saw him win the European Golden Shoe. Larsson won four league titles in his seven years at Celtic. He also helped the team reach the 2003 UEFA Cup Final against Porto, scoring both goals in a 3\u20132 defeat in extra time. His 242 goals in 313 matches saw Celtic fans nickname him The King of Kings. Larsson joined Barcelona in 2004, where he won two league titles and the 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League, providing the assists for both goals in the final. Following the expiration of his contract at Barcelona, Larsson returned to Helsingborg, although he also had a brief spell on loan at Manchester United in early 2007. He announced his retirement from football on 20 October 2009.[3]\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest Swedish players of all time, Larsson played for Sweden in three FIFA World Cups and three UEFA European Championships, winning a bronze medal at the 1994 World Cup, and is a former captain of the national team. He ended his international career with 37 goals in 106 matches. He also won the Golden Ball (Guldbollen), the annual Award for best Swedish footballer twice, first in 1998 and again in 2004, while in 2003 he was named the Greatest Swedish Footballer of the Last 50 Years as part of the UEFA Jubilee Awards. He is also the all-time leading goalscorer in the UEFA Europa League/UEFA Cup.[4]\n\nIn 2010, Larsson began his career as a manager at the Superettan club Landskrona BoIS, where he stayed for three seasons. He later managed Falkenberg in Allsvenskan, and he took over at Helsingborg in 2015, where his son, Jordan was one of his players. Helsingborg were relegated to Superettan in 2016 and Larsson left the club. Three years later he made a brief return in the same role at the club.[5] He served Barcelona as assistant to Ronald Koeman from August 2020 until October 2021.\n\nEdward Henrik Larsson[6] was born on 20 September 1971[7] in Helsingborg, Scania.[8] His father, Francisco Da Rocha, is from Cape Verde,[9] and his mother, Eva Larsson, is Swedish.[10] His parents, who never married and split up when he was 12,[10] decided that he should take his mother's surname because they felt it would make it easier for their son to be accepted in Sweden.[11] He credits his father for his love of football.[10] His father gave him a football when he was 16 months old and as a child, he was able to practice with brothers and friends on a large field near his home in Helsingborg.[12] He has said of his school years, \"I experienced some racism, because back then it was unusual to have a dark kid at school, I was one of the few.\"[13] He watched English football on television and his parents gave him a video of Pel\u00e9's life story, both of which inspired him.[13]\n\nLarsson began playing at lower-league H\u00f6gaborg at age six.[13] This smaller club was known to provide a good education for young players, and since Larsson left he has stressed how important this was not only for his football but also for his adult life in general.[14][15][16] He went on to start his professional career playing for their senior team at age 17 while still at school.[17] When he was 18, he had a trial at Benfica, at the time being managed by Larsson's country-mate Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson.[18] On leaving school at 18, Larsson combined a semi-pro football career at H\u00f6gaborg with work as a fruit packer.[17]\n\nIn four years playing at senior level with H\u00f6gaborg, Larsson scored 23 goals in 74 matches. In 1992, second division side Helsingborg (the main club of his home city) signed Larsson.[17]\n\nIn his first year as a full-time professional, Larsson scored 34 goals for Helsingborg and his partnership up front with veteran striker Mats Magnusson helped the side win promotion to the top Swedish division, the Allsvenskan, the club's return to the top tier after 24 seasons in the lower divisions.[17] His star continued to rise the following year, as he netted 16 goals to help Helsingborg to a respectable mid-table finish.[17]\n\nIn November 1993, Dutch side Feyenoord signed Larsson for a fee of \u00a3295,000.[17] He made his league debut on 21 November 1993 as a substitute for Regi Blinker in a 1\u20131 home draw against Vitesse.[19] Larsson took time to adjust to working and living in a foreign country and could only muster a modest 6 goals in 27 appearances in his first season.[17] His goalscoring record improved in subsequent seasons, but he continued to be unsettled and frustrated by a combination of ever-changing coaches, being played in unfamiliar positions and latterly the club's player-rotation policy which saw him being substituted fifty or sixty minutes into a match even when playing well.[17][20]\n\nLarsson won his first major winner's medal on 12 May 1994 when he played in the Feyenoord side that defeated NEC 2\u20131 in the final of the KNVB Cup.[21] The following season, Larsson won his second winner's medal in the same tournament when Feyenoord won 2\u20131 against Volendam.[22] He did record a hat-trick in a 4\u20133 win against Werder Bremen in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1994\u201395.[23]\n\nIn 1997, Larsson told manager Arie Haan that he wished to leave the club.[17] A legal dispute then ensued over a clause in his contract that Larsson claimed would allow him to be sold on if a fee of \u00a3600,000 was offered.[20] Larsson won his case and in July 1997, he signed for Scottish side Celtic.[24]\n\nFollowing the contract dispute with Feyenoord, Larsson was signed by Celtic manager Wim Jansen in July 1997 for a fee of \u00a3650,000.[24] In his first season at Celtic, he played the role of supporting forward alongside Darren Jackson, Simon Donnelly and later Harald Brattbakk.\n\nIn Larsson's Celtic debut, against Hibernian at Easter Road, he came on as a late substitute. He inadvertently passed the ball to Hibernian player Chic Charnley, who scored, resulting in a 2\u20131 defeat for Celtic.[25] He scored an own goal in his first European game,[26] although Celtic did go on to win 6\u20133 against Austrian side Tirol Innsbruck.[27] He went on to score 19 goals in all competitions,[28] and was Celtic's top scorer for the season. In November 1997, Larsson won his first medal for the club after a 3\u20130 win over Dundee United at Ibrox Stadium gave Celtic the Scottish League Cup. Larsson scored Celtic's second goal in the match.[29] On the final day of the league season, he scored the opener with a powerful shot from 20 yards out in a 2\u20130 win against St Johnstone to clinch the championship for Celtic.[29] It was the club's first league championship win since the double winning season 1987\u201388 and stopped Old Firm rivals Rangers from breaking Celtic's record of nine titles in a row.[30]\n\nLarsson's second season with the club saw a change in management with Jozef Venglo\u0161 taking over following Wim Jansen's resignation.[31] Playing in a more advanced striker's role, Larsson scored 38 goals to end the season as both Celtic and Scotland's top goalscorer.[28][32] During the season, Larsson also scored for the first time in an Old Firm match, with two goals in a 5\u20131 victory in November,[33][34] and the equaliser in the 2\u20132 New Year's Day match at Ibrox.[35] Throughout the season, Larsson forged a prolific partnership with diminutive Slovak playmaker \u013dubom\u00edr Morav\u010d\u00edk.[36] He was also awarded the honours of SPFA Players' Player of the Year, SFWA Footballer of the Year,[37] and Swedish Footballer of the Year.[38] The 1998\u201399 season ultimately proved disappointing for Celtic, as they finished runners-up to rivals Rangers in both the newly established Scottish Premier League (SPL),[39] and the Scottish Cup.[40]\n\nThe 1999\u20132000 season saw another change in management for Celtic. Former Liverpool and England international winger John Barnes replaced Venglo\u0161 to become manager at the club.[41] The season started very brightly for Larsson as he scored eight league goals in nine games for the club.[41] During Celtic's 1\u20130 defeat in a UEFA Cup tie against Lyon on 21 October 1999, Larsson suffered a career-threatening injury, breaking his leg in two places in a challenge with Serge Blanc.[42] This resulted in him spending eight months on the sidelines,[43] only returning on the last day of the 1999\u20132000 season. John Barnes cited Larsson's injury as being a significant factor in his sacking by Celtic after only months in the position.[44] It was initially feared that Larsson had suffered a compound leg fracture, an injury which would normally result in an even longer absence \u2013 or possibly even end his career \u2013 but X-rays soon revealed that the injury was not as serious as originally feared.[45] By the time Larsson had completed his rehabilitation, John Barnes had been sacked and replaced by director of football Kenny Dalglish as interim manager.[46] Larsson made his comeback with a substitute appearance against Dundee United at Celtic Park on the final day of the SPL season.[47]\n\nFollowing the arrival of Martin O'Neill in the summer of 2000,[48] Larsson had his most successful season for Celtic. He began a successful partnership with new arrival Chris Sutton,[49] as he scored 35 league goals in 38 league games to become SPL top goalscorer and to win the European Golden Shoe.[50] The season saw Celtic win the domestic treble of the Scottish League Cup, Scottish Cup and the SPL.[51] Larsson scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Kilmarnock at Hampden Park to win the Scottish League Cup,[52] the first non-Scot to do so in a cup final in Scotland.[53] He also scored twice in the Scottish Cup in a 3\u20130 win over Hibernian.[51] Other highlights for Larsson included two goals against Rangers in the 6\u20132 win at Parkhead early in the season,[54][55] scoring his 50th goal of the season against Rangers at Ibrox in a 3\u20130 victory towards the end of the season[56] and finishing the season with a total of 53 goals in all competitions.[28] He was again voted SPFA Players' Player of the Year, as well as SFWA Footballer of the Year and FourFourTwo Scottish Player of the Year.[57][58]\n\nRangers manager Dick Advocaat said \"Larsson is one of the best strikers in Europe, maybe the world. If you watch Batistuta, he is sometimes not seen for 90 minutes but he scores two goals. Larsson has even more, because, besides being a good player and goalscorer, he has a tremendous work rate.\"[59]\n\nLarsson's fifth season at Celtic yielded a second consecutive SPL title for the club.[60] It also marked the club's first foray into the UEFA Champions League group stage. Larsson scored his first Champions League goal with a penalty in Celtic's opening fixture in a 3\u20132 defeat to Juventus in Turin.[61] He scored again for Celtic in their Champions League campaign with the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Porto,[62] and again from the penalty spot against Juventus in a thrilling 4\u20133 victory at Celtic Park.[63] Despite achieving a Scottish record of nine points in the group stage, Celtic failed to qualify for the latter stages and parachuted into the UEFA Cup. The club were drawn against Valencia, with Larsson scoring the second leg goal to take the tie into penalties, which Celtic eventually lost.[64] Larsson once again ended the season as SPL top goalscorer with 29 goals from 33 league appearances.[65][66]\n\nThe 2002\u201303 season saw the club reach the 2003 UEFA Cup final.[67] After losing out on a place in the Champions League following an away goals defeat to Basel,[68] Celtic dropped into the UEFA Cup. In the first round, Celtic were paired with Lithuanian side S\u016bduva, with Larsson scoring a hat-trick in the 8\u20131 first leg victory,[69] as they progressed 10\u20131 on aggregate after adding a 2\u20130 away win.[70] The second round saw former Rangers player-manager Graeme Souness' Blackburn Rovers side visit Celtic Park in a matched dubbed \"The Battle of Britain\".[71] Celtic went into the second leg at Ewood Park 1\u20130 up courtesy of a late Larsson goal.[72] After comments from the Blackburn players in the media, who felt their team deserved to win, claiming that the tie was \"like men against boys\",[73] Larsson scored the opening goal in a 2\u20130 away win.[74] The following rounds saw Celtic beat Celta Vigo 2\u20132 on away goals,[75] and VfB Stuttgart 5\u20134 on aggregate.[76] Larsson missed both ties with Stuttgart, following a broken jaw, after a collision with Gustave Bahoken in an SPL match against Livingston,[77] but he returned from injury in time for Celtic's quarter-final clash with 2001 winners Liverpool.[78] Larsson scored the opener in a 1\u20131 draw at Celtic Park.[79] Celtic followed that up with a 2\u20130 victory at Anfield to win the tie 3\u20131 on aggregate,[80]\n\nCeltic met Portuguese side Boavista in the semi-final.[81] Boavista took the advantage on away goals after a 1\u20131 draw in the first leg, in which Larsson scored the equaliser after missing a penalty.[82] In the second leg, Larsson struck for Celtic after a one-two with John Hartson with ten minutes remaining. The goal sent Celtic through to their first European final since 1970.[83] The final in Seville against Porto saw Larsson equalise twice with two headers, although Celtic eventually lost 3\u20132 after extra time.[67] Larsson also finished runner-up to Porto's Derlei in the competition's goalscoring charts. Larsson described the pain of the defeat as being the worst moment of his career, including his broken leg in 1999.[84] More disappointment followed, as Celtic finished runners-up to Rangers on the last day of the SPL season, by only a single goal on goal difference.[85] 2003 also saw Larsson voted as the Greatest Swedish Footballer of the Last 50 Years as part of the UEFA Jubilee Awards.[86] He also finished the season again the top SPL goalscorer with 28 goals from 35 games.[65][66] Larsson ranked 14th (in 2001) and 12th (in 2003) in the final standings for the Ballon d'Or.[87]\n\nLarsson's seventh and final season for Celtic saw the club win the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup titles.[88]\n\nLarsson scored his only Champions League goal of the season against Anderlecht in a 3\u20131 win at Celtic Park.[89] He added to his European goal tally with a double in a 3\u20130 UEFA Cup third round victory over Teplice,[90] and the equaliser in a first leg quarter-final tie at Celtic Park against Villarreal, after earlier having a goal disallowed for handball; the match ended 1\u20131.[91] It was Larsson's final European goal for Celtic.[92] After parachuting from the Champions League, Celtic reached the UEFA Cup quarter-finals, eliminating Barcelona en route,[93] before losing 3\u20131 on aggregate to Villarreal.[94]\n\nCeltic defeated Rangers in all five Old Firm fixtures that season.[95] Larsson's final goal against Rangers came in a 1\u20130 Scottish Cup win at Parkhead.[96] His final competitive game at home for Celtic came in a league match against Dundee United on 16 May 2004, and he scored both goals as Celtic won 2\u20131.[97] In his last competitive appearance for Celtic, he scored two goals to defeat Dunfermline Athletic on 22 May 2004 at Hampden and win the 2004 Scottish Cup final.[88]\n\nLarsson was also voted Swedish Footballer of the Year for the second time for his performances throughout the 2003\u201304 season.[38] He was also again a nominee for the Ballon d'Or but received no votes.[98]\n\nAfter leaving Celtic, Larsson returned to play in testimonial matches three times. In May 2005, he played in Jackie McNamara's testimonial against the Republic of Ireland,[99] In May 2008, Larsson left Sweden's national training camp early to take part in a match played in memory of Larsson's former teammate Phil O'Donnell, who had died in December 2007 while playing in a match for Motherwell. Larsson played as part of Celtic's 1998 championship-winning side against the Motherwell 1991 Scottish Cup-winning side.[100] On 9 August 2011, Larsson played for the Celtic Legends against the Manchester United Legends for John Kennedy's testimonial[101]\n\nIn his seven years at Celtic, Larsson won four SPL titles, two Scottish League Cups and two Scottish Cups. He was the top goalscorer in the Scottish Premier League for five of the six seasons that he competed in, the only exception being the 1999\u20132000 season, most of which Larsson missed due to a broken leg. He was the SPL (1998\u20132013) record goalscorer with 158 goals (Kris Boyd broke his record in 2009).[102]\n\nLarsson was also a consistent goalscorer in European competition. With 35 goals, Larsson is the record goalscorer for Celtic in UEFA competitions.[103] Celtic fans selected Larsson (the only player from outside Scotland) in the greatest ever Celtic team, when a vote was held in 2002.[104]\n\nLarsson played a testimonial match on 25 May 2004 against Sevilla in front of a capacity crowd at Celtic Park.[105] In all, he scored 242 goals for Celtic in 313 matches, and his performances earned him the nickname The King of Kings from fans.[106]\n\nAt the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Larsson left Celtic on a free transfer and signed a one-year contract with Barcelona with an option for a second year.[107] Larsson's contribution in Bar\u00e7a's La Liga win in his first season there was disrupted by serious injury. He scored 3 goals in 12 Liga games and one goal (against his former club Celtic)[108] in four Champions League matches. After the match against Celtic, he said: \"It was very difficult for me to celebrate my goal because I had so many great times here.\"[109] On 20 November 2004, during the 3\u20130 victory in El Cl\u00e1sico against Real Madrid, Larsson tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus in his left knee.[110] Despite his injury-hit 2004\u201305 season, playing only 16 games, Barcelona took the option to extend his contract.[111]\n\n\nIn December 2005, Larsson announced that at the end of his contract, which ended in July, he would leave Barcelona and return to Sweden to end his career. He revealed that he had refused an offer by club president Joan Laporta to extend his contract to the end of the next season.[112] On the announcement of his departure, Ronaldinho said:[113]\nWith Henrik leaving us at the end of the season this club is losing a great scorer, no question. But I am also losing a great friend. Henrik was my idol and now that I am playing next to him it is fantastic.\nIn Larsson's final match for Barcelona, his substitute introduction was pivotal to win the 2006 Champions League final. Larsson assisted both of Barcelona's goals in a 2\u20131 win over Arsenal. Thierry Henry paid tribute to Larsson's contribution to Barcelona's win after the match, saying, \"People always talk about Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Ludovic Giuly and everything, but I didn't see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; you need to talk about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight.\"[114] Indeed, his ability to give Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by the international press.[115][116] In 2005\u201306, Larsson scored ten goals as Barcelona won La Liga for a second consecutive year.\n\nAfter Sweden's elimination from the 2006 FIFA World Cup on 24 June 2006, Larsson joined up with his former club, Helsingborg.[117] He made his second debut for his home town club against Hammarby in the Swedish Cup on 6 July 2006. Helsingborg went on to win the competition, defeating Gefle 2\u20130 in the final on 11 November 2006, earning Larsson another medal.[118] Larsson's eight league goals in 15 appearances[119] also helped his team to a fourth-place finish in the Allsvenskan.[120] This successful season earned Helsingborg a slot in the following season's UEFA Cup.\n\nShortly after rejoining Helsingborg, Larsson was signed on loan by Manchester United from 1 January until 12 March 2007, coinciding with the Allsvenskan's off-season.[121] He scored on his debut against Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round on 7 January 2007 at Old Trafford, facing his former Celtic manager Martin O'Neill.[122] Larsson scored his first ever FA Premier League goal on 31 January in a 4\u20130 win over Watford.[123]\n\nWhile United were eager to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated that he had made a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March. This was confirmed on 20 February, when Larsson announced that he would not be extending his loan period.[124] Despite this, Alex Ferguson praised the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay,[125] saying, \"He's been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he's done has been excellent.\"[126] \"We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that \u2013 but I would have done anything to keep him.\"[125] Larsson scored Manchester United's only goal in their win against Lille at Old Trafford in the Champions League.[127] He made his final appearance for United on 10 March in an FA Cup sixth round tie away to Middlesbrough, ending in a 2\u20132 draw.[128]\n\nManchester United won the Premier League two months after Larsson had left the club, and although he had not played the required quota of ten league games to qualify for a Premier League winners medal, he,[129] alongside Alan Smith, was granted special dispensation by the Premier League after the club requested extra medals for the two.[130][131] Larsson has since confirmed that he didn't receive a medal.[132]\n\nLarsson's next appearance at Old Trafford in fact came against United, the day after his loan with the club expired, as captain for the Europe XI team in the UEFA Celebration Match.[133][134] Larsson received a standing ovation from the home fans upon being substituted for Liverpool player Robbie Fowler.[135]\n\nAfter leaving Manchester United in March 2007, Larsson resumed his career with Helsingborg. Larsson helped the club through the preliminary stages of the UEFA Cup, where Larsson scored twice against Estonian side Narva Trans and once against League of Ireland side Drogheda United.[136] The first round proper of the UEFA Cup that season saw a high-scoring tie between Helsingborg and Heerenveen, Larsson's side lost 5\u20133 in the Netherlands on 20 September 2007, with Larsson scoring twice. The return leg in Sweden on 4 October 2007 saw Helsingborg win 5\u20131, Larsson again scoring, to win the tie 8\u20136 on aggregate and qualify for the group stage.[137] Helsingborg progressed from the group stage, with Larsson scoring against Panionios, Austria Wien and Bordeaux, and they qualified for the round of 32, where they lost 1\u20134 on aggregate to PSV in February 2008.[137] Helsingborg could not match their league performances of the previous year, and finished in eight place in Allsvenskan in 2007.[138] Helsingborg also failed to retain the Swedish Cup, losing 1\u20132 to BoIS in the fourth round in June 2007.[139]\n\nThe 2008 Allsvenskan saw Larsson produce his best league goal-scoring tally since returning to Sweden, with his 14 goals[140] helping Helsingborg to fourth place[141] and qualification in 2009\u201310 for the rebranded UEFA Europa League, formerly the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn July 2009, Larsson scored three goals in the Europa League qualifying ties against Eastern European minnows Mika and Zestaponi.[142] He broke his knee-cap during the first leg of the next qualifying round against Sarajevo on 30 July 2009,[142] and was out for an estimated eight weeks. Some reports at the time suggested that this in fact was the end of his playing career, with this injury also coming on top of the recent death of his younger brother, Robert. He returned to the first team on 16 September 2009, appearing as a substitute in a 1\u20133 defeat against IFK G\u00f6teborg in the Swedish Cup,[143] and then on 24 September 2009 in his first start since returning from injury, he scored two goals (including the winner) against league rivals AIK.[143] He is Helsingborg's record goalscorer in UEFA competitions with 12 goals.[144]\n\nOn 20 October 2009, Larsson announced his retirement from playing at the end of the 2009 Allsvenskan.[3] The announcement followed a previous statement from the player declaring his intention to retire from international duty. Larsson had also stated his desire to move into coaching and expressed his intent to study for coaching qualifications in Scotland under the Scottish Football Association system.[145] Larsson also discussed the possibility of taking up floorball on a full-time basis.[146]\n\nLarsson took to the pitch for the final time in Helsingborg's 2\u20130 Allsvenskan loss to Djurg\u00e5rden on 28 October 2009, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd.[147][148][149]\n\nLarsson participated in the Soccer Aid football match at Old Trafford on 6 June 2010 for the Rest of the World team in aid of UNICEF.[150] Larsson made a promise that at the end of his football career, he would play one season at his first club, H\u00f6gaborg. When he retired at the end of the 2009 season, that promise was not fulfilled. In August 2010, however, Larsson played with H\u00f6gaborg's veterans team and scored 16 goals in 5 matches.[151]\n\nIn August 2012, Larsson came out of retirement for a brief spell at Swedish fifth division (Division 3) side R\u00e5\u00e5.[152] He made one appearance, coming on as a substitute in a league match on 22 September 2012, a 1\u20131 draw against H\u00f6gan\u00e4s.[153] Larsson then registered as a player with H\u00f6gaborg's senior-recreational side and played games with them. Due to the many injuries, Larsson was included in the first-team squad that beat Tenhult with 4\u20132 on 19 June 2013. He came off the bench in the 85th minute, and played alongside his son, Jordan.[154][155] At age 42, Larsson took part in a further league match for H\u00f6gaborg on 26 October 2013, when he played the first 66 minutes in a 2\u20130 win over IF Haga.[156][157] At age 44, Larsson took part in a 7\u20131 friendly win for Helsingborg over IFK Malm\u00f6, in which he scored in the 89th minute.[158]\n\nLarsson scored 37 goals in 106 matches for the Sweden national team. He scored his first international goal in his debut on 13 October 1993, during the World Cup qualifications stage, in a 3\u20132 win against Finland.[17][159]\n\nSweden manager Tommy Svensson selected Larsson for his 22-man squad for the 1994 World Cup squad,[17] alongside established forwards such as Tomas Brolin, Kennet Andersson and Martin Dahlin. Larsson began Sweden's first game of the tournament, against Cameroon, on the bench, but came on as a substitute with Sweden trailing 1\u20132. Larsson struck a fierce, long-range shot against the crossbar, with Dahlin reacting quickly to score the rebound to give their country a 2\u20132 draw.[17] He again came on as a late substitute in the following game against Russia, and then played from the start in the final game of the group against Brazil.[17] He was not used in the last 16 game against Saudi Arabia, but came on a substitute in the quarter-final tie against Romania. The match finished 2\u20132 after extra time, with Sweden winning on penalties, one of which was scored by Larsson.[17] Larsson did not feature in Sweden's 0\u20131 defeat against Brazil in the semi-final, but did play in the third-place play-off against Bulgaria which Sweden won 4\u20130, including Larsson's first World Cup goal, latching onto a through-ball from Brolin before rounding Bulgarian goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov and wrong-footing defender Trifon Ivanov.[17] That win secured third-place at the 1994 World Cup for Sweden, their best showing in a tournament since finishing runner-up to Brazil in 1958.[160]\n\nLarsson became a regular in the side after that, playing in six of his country's qualifiers for UEFA Euro 1996. He did not score in any of these matches and Sweden failed to qualify for the finals.\n\nHe scored one goal in four qualifying games as Sweden also failed to qualify for the 1998 World Cup.[161]\n\nSweden succeeded in qualifying for Euro 2000, with Larsson scoring three goals during the qualifying matches. Larsson was selected for the Sweden squad despite having only just recovered from a broken leg sustained playing for Celtic.[162][163] Euro 2000 was not a great success for Sweden, who went out at the first group stage, but Larsson scored against Italy in a 1\u20132 defeat.[164]\n\nSweden reappeared on the global stage two years later at the 2002 World Cup. Larsson helped guide Sweden out of the group of death and into the knockout round with a 2\u20131 win over Nigeria in which he scored both goals.[165] He then scored in the round of 16 match against Senegal, though Sweden ended up losing 1\u20132 in extra time to a golden goal and were eliminated.[166] Larsson chose to retire from international football after the World Cup.[167]\n\nLarsson's decision to retire from international football was met with dismay in Sweden and there was much clamoring for him to return to the team for their campaign at Euro 2004 in Portugal.[168] Despite initially maintaining his decision to retire, he eventually agreed to return to the national side for Euro 2004.[169] Playing up front alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Larsson scored three goals in four matches and lead Sweden to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated in a penalty shoot-out by the Netherlands. Larsson's diving header against Bulgaria was voted best goal of the tournament.[170]\n\nLarsson also featured at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He scored in the final minute of the match against England for Sweden to draw the match 2\u20132 in their final match in the group stages.[171] The goal sealed Sweden's qualification for the second round of the tournament. In Sweden's last 16 game against hosts Germany, Larsson missed a penalty and Sweden went out with the score at 2\u20130 to Germany.[172]\n\nHe retired from international football for the second time on 17 July 2006.[173] \"It is time to quit now. It feels right. I'm done with the national team\", the 34-year-old Larsson told TV station Canal Plus.\n\nSweden boss Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck managed to lure Larsson out of international retirement once more and on 13 May 2008, the Swedish Football Association officially declared that Larsson had agreed to make a comeback and play for Sweden once again at Euro 2008.[174] Larsson assisted Zlatan Ibrahimovic for a goal against Greece in the first group stage game, but could not help Sweden advance to the quarter-finals.[175]\n\nFollowing former team captain Freddie Ljungberg's decision to quit the national side after the tournament, Larsson was chosen to become the new captain in a friendly match against France on 20 August 2008,[176] He scored his 37th goal for Sweden in that match, although France ended up winning 3\u20132.[177] He played his 100th game for Sweden on 6 September 2008, in a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Albania, which ended in a 0\u20130 draw.[178]\n\nOn 11 October 2009, after it was clear that Sweden had failed to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Larsson once again decided to retire from the national team.\nAt the age of 38 years and 20 days, Larsson became the oldest outfield player in the history of the Sweden national team with his last ever appearance against Denmark on 10 October 2009. Since then, Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 has become Sweden's oldest outfield player.[179]\n\nLarsson made clear his intentions to take up coaching once his playing career came to an end, having also expressed an interest in returning to Celtic in a coaching capacity.[180]\n\nOn 14 December 2009 Larsson was appointed manager at Landskrona BoIS, a Swedish second division football club, on a one-year contract.[181]\n\nThe news that Larsson would take over Landskrona was received with mixed feelings, as his former club Helsingborg traditionally were their main rivals.[182]\n\nThe 2010 Superettan, the first season for Larsson as a manager, started off positively for Landskrona. With an aggressively attacking 4\u20133\u20133 formation Larsson's club lined up victories and fought for the top positions and promotion to Allsvenskan, until the very end of the season. They finished in fifth place. The Landskrona BoIS board was satisfied with the results, and  both Larsson and his assistant manager Hans Eklund renewed their contracts for another year.[183]\n\nOn 23 March 2011, Landskrona BoIS announced the recruitment of the Swedish national team qualified midfielder Marcus Lantz from Helsingborg, a solicitation that was largely thanks to Larsson.[184] With the recruitment of Lantz, Henrik Larsson announced a major effort to make the club win Superettan and be promoted to Allsvenskan, from which they were relegated in 2005.[185]\n\nBefore the 2011 Superettan season, the managers of the other Superettan clubs had tipped Landskrona as the likely champion.[186] But the season was about to become the club's worst in years. Instead of being in the top of the table, Landskrona was stuck at the bottom more than halfway into the season, with relegation looming. Some fans protested against both the board and Henrik Larsson, sarcastically suggesting that the club had used an impostor instead of the real Larsson.[187] The crisis went so deep within the association that the board wanted Larsson himself to make a comeback as a player. Larsson played for 20 minutes with Landskrona's reserve team in a match against Mj\u00e4llby AIF, but felt physically unprepared for playing in Superettan, even if the sporting director of Landskrona, Mats Aronsson, believed the opposite.[188] Landskrona and Larsson avoided relegation and finished tenth largely because of the summer signing of goalkeeper Ivo Vazge\u010d who achieved the best save percentage in the league.[189]\n\nOn 21 November 2011, Larsson signed a new one-year contract, making him manager for Landskrona during the 2012 Superettan as well.[190] Landskrona performed better in 2012, but only managed to finish in sixth place instead of achieving the third-place finish which would have meant qualification for a promotion play-off spot.[191] In November 2012, Larsson confirmed he had left his position and would consider any available posts elsewhere.[192][193]\n\nOn 4 December 2013, Larsson was appointed manager of Falkenberg, signing a one-year rolling contact with the newly promoted club.[194] After securing Falkenberg's position in Allsvenskan, it was announced on 10 November 2014 that he would not manage the club for the 2015 season.[195]\n\nAfter leaving Falkenberg, Larsson was appointed manager of Helsingborg.[196] In November 2016, Helsingborg were relegated to Superettan after losing a two-legged play-off against Halmstad. After the final whistle, a minor group of disappointed home fans attacked both Larsson and his son, Jordan.[197] Following the end of the season, Larsson decided to leave the club.[198]\n\nOn 3 October 2018, Division 1 club \u00c4ngelholms FF announced that Larsson would join the staff as assistant to head coach Alexander Tengryd, whom Larsson had worked together with in Helsingborg.[199] At the time of his appointment, \u00c4ngelholm were on 13 place and five matches in a row without a win with six matches left of the season. First match with Larsson in the staff was three days later against Utsiktens BK away. The match ended in a 1-0 win for \u00c4ngelholm.[200] \u00c4ngelholm would only take two points in their last five matches, including losing 0-4 to Oskarshamns AIK and 0-3 to Tv\u00e5\u00e5kers, and dropped to 15th place which meant immediate relegation. Larsson, along with head coach Alexander Tengryd, left the club at the end of the season.\n\nOn 16 June 2019, Helsingborg announced that Larsson had returned to the club as their new manager.[201]\n\nOn 23 August 2019, Helsingborg announced that Larsson had decided to quit as head coach after being verbally assaulted on social media following the club's loss to third tier club Oskarshamns AIK in the qualification to Svenska Cupen group stage.[202]\n\nIn September 2019 he began talks with English club Southend United about becoming their manager,[203] but these collapsed when proposed assistant Tommy Johnson accepted another offer.[204]\n\nOn 21 August 2020, FC Barcelona announced that Larsson and Alfred Schreuder had joined new head coach Ronald Koeman\u2018s coaching staff until 30 June 2022.[205] On 27 October 2021, the club confirmed Koeman had been relieved of his duties, which resulted in the departure of Larsson from FC Barcelona's coaching staff.\n\nLarsson also played floorball at a competitive level in 1989. On 23 November 2008, he resumed his floorball career when he played his first Swedish Super League game for Helsingborg. In his second game for the club, he made two assists, and was voted man of the match.[206][207]\n\nLarsson stood out for his discipline, professionalism and work-rate throughout his career.[208][209][210]\n\nOn 21 June 1996, Larsson married Magdalena Spjuth,[10] whom he had met in a restaurant when he was 19 years old.[13] She is the daughter of a politician and an education director at the local municipality.[10] They have a son, professional footballer Jordan Larsson (born 1997 and named after basketball player Michael Jordan),[13] who has represented Sweden at international level, and a daughter, Janelle Larsson[10][211] (born 2002), a member of the junior Swedish national show jumping team.\n\nOn 6 June 2009, before Sweden's 1\u20130 loss against Denmark, Larsson's younger brother Robert, who had a troubled personal life, was found dead in his flat in their hometown of Helsingborg.[212] Henrik was not told until after the match had concluded.[213] Henrik Larsson also has an elder half-brother, Kim.[10]\n\nFeyenoord[222]\n\nCeltic[222]\n\nBarcelona[222]\n\nHelsingborg[222]\n\nManchester United\n\nSweden[222]\n\nIndividual[222]\n\nOrders and special awards[222]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Larsson"}, {"id": 162, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/37/733612/original/chuni-goswami-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Chuni Goswami", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/chuni-goswami/733612", "desc": "Subimal Goswami (born 15 January 1938), commonly known by his nickname Chuni Goswami, is a former Indian international footballer and first class cricketer.

As footballer, he played as a striker or winger, captained both the Mohun Bagan[2][3] club and the India national team.[4] He also served as the Sheriff of Kolkata. Goswami scored nine goals in 30 international appearances. He was an Olympian, represented India national team at the 1960 Summer Olympics.[5][6] He also led the team to achieve the gold medal at the 1962 Asian Games,[7] and earn the runners-up position at the 1964 AFC Asian Cup.[8]\n\nPlaying for the India national team under coaching of Syed Abdul Rahim,[9] Goswami was also a first class cricketer, playing Ranji Trophy for Bengal. He captained his team to the final of the tournament in 1971\u201372.[10] On 15 January 2020, India Post issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honour.[11] Goswami's autobiography Khelte Khelte was published in 1982.[12]\n\nBorn in Kishoreganj, Bengal Presidency, Goswami moved to Calcutta and settled there in his childhood. His elder brother Manik Goswami was also a footballer who played for George Telegraph.[13] Goswami was married to Basanti and gave birth to their son, named Sudipto.[14]\n\nChuni Goswami holds the distinction of playing for a single club, Mohun Bagan, throughout his club career despite numerous offers from other clubs including one reported offer from Tottenham Hotspur.[15]\n\nChuni Goswami was the poster boy of Indian football. He was a top-class player with dribbling, passing, his ball control was better than anybody else. His passing and his through passes were excellent. He could assist strikers like Neville D'Souza and make them score with his beautiful passes.\nGoswami joined the Mohun Bagan junior team in 1946 at the age of 8 years. He was a part of the junior squad up to 1954 and then graduated to the Mohun Bagan senior team.[17] Mentored by club legend Balaidas Chatterjee, Goswami went on to represent Mohun Bagan in various foreign tours.[18][19] He made his club debut on 29 May in the same year in Mohun Bagan's 3\u20130 win against Eastern Railway, in which he scored a goal.[12] In the 1959 CFL season, Goswami scored 14 goals for his team.[20] He continued playing for Mohun Bagan until his retirement in 1968. In the 1960s, Goswami and Jarnail Singh became two highest-paid players of the club; both of them captained the team respectively.[21] Goswami captained Mohun Bagan in five seasons from 1960 to 1964.[22][23] During his stay at the club, he won the Calcutta Football League six times, IFA Shield and Durand Cup four times.\n\nChuni Goswami made his international debut for India in 1956 during the team's 1\u20130 victory over the Chinese Olympic team.[23] He went on to play for India in 50 international matches including in Olympics, Asian Games, Asia Cup and Merdeka Cup. He captained India to the Asian Games Gold Medal in 1962 and a Silver in the 1964 AFC Asian Cup in Tel Aviv and in the Merdeka Cup.[24][25][26][27] Goswami, known for having incredible partnership with P. K. Banerjee and Tulsidas Balaram, is one of the \"Indian football's holy trinity\".[28][29][30][31]\n\nChuni Goswami played in 30 FIFA \"A\" international matches having scored 9 times for the National team.[32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42]\n\nMohun Bagan[51]\n\nIndia\n\nBengal[56][57]\n\nIndividual\n\nRecords\n\nChuni Goswami made his first class debut for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy during the 1962\u201363 season.[60] He was a Right Handed Batsman and a Right Arm Medium Pacer. After retiring from football, Goswami fully focussed on playing cricket for West Bengal. He appeared in two Ranji Trophy finals, losing to Mumbai each time. In the 1968\u201369 final, he scored 96 and 84; but Ajit Wadekar's century helped Mumbai win on first innings lead. Later, he led the Bengal cricket team to a 1972 Ranji Trophy final which they lost to Mumbai for whom Gavaskar and Shivalkar starred. Playing for Combined East and Central Zone team against the touring West Indies side in December 1966, Chuni Goswami took 8 wickets in the match as his team surprisingly beat the tourists by an innings.[61] In his cricket career, which spanned up to the 1972\u201373 season, he played 46 first class matches, scoring 1,592 runs with one century and seven fifties, and took 47 wickets.[62]\n\nGoswami later became team official of Mohun Bagan and went with Karuna Bhattacharya managed team to newly independent Bangladesh in May 1972, where they defeated Dhaka Mohammedan in first match, but lost to Shadhin Bangla football team in their last match.[63] He later became director of Tata Football Academy in 1986,[12] and also managed India national football team in 1991\u201392.\n\nGoswami died on 30 April 2020 at the age of 82 in Kolkata after a prolonged illness.[64] For the last few months, Goswami was suffering from underlying ailments with diabetes, prostate infection and neurological problems.

He is currently the head coach of Blackpool.\n\nMcCarthy began his playing career at Barnsley in 1977, and he later had spells at Manchester City, Celtic, Lyon, and finally Millwall, retiring in 1992. Born and raised in England, he represented the Republic of Ireland, for whom he earned 57 caps and played at UEFA Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\n\nMcCarthy managed Millwall and then the Republic of Ireland. He guided the country to the knockout stage of the last 16 of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He later managed Sunderland, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town. McCarthy began a second tenure as manager of the Republic of Ireland national team in November 2018, leaving after having guided the team to a UEFA Euro 2020 playoff place. He then had brief spells at Cypriot club APOEL and Cardiff City. He has also been a television pundit and commentator, including for the BBC and Virgin Media Television.\n\nBorn in Barnsley, Yorkshire,[1] McCarthy made his league debut for then-Fourth Division Barnsley on 20 August 1977 in a 4\u20130 win over Rochdale. He spent two years in the basement league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again went up to the (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his home town club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club Manchester City.\n\nThe Maine Road club won promotion in McCarthy's first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level. His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached mid-table, but relegation struck the following year. McCarthy himself would not face the drop though as he moved to Celtic in May 1987.[3]\n\nHe picked up his first silverware at the Scottish club as they won the league and cup double in his first season. The following season McCarthy again won a Scottish Cup winners medal,[4] although the club had to settle for third place in the league.[5]\n\nMcCarthy again moved onto a new country, as he joined Lyon on a three-year contract in July 1989.[4][6]\n\nHowever, things did not work out for the defender in France and, feeling his international chances were being harmed, he returned to England on loan with top flight Millwall in March 1990.[4] Despite the London side suffering relegation during his loan period, McCarthy impressed enough to earn a move and he was signed permanently in May 1990 for \u00a3200,000. His appearances in the next two seasons were often limited by injuries and he effectively retired from playing when he took over as manager of the club in 1992.[7]\n\nMcCarthy, the son of an Irish-born father, Charlie, is an Irish citizen since birth.[8] He made his Irish international debut in a goalless friendly against Poland on 23 May 1984, McCarthy soon became a first-choice player and featured in all three of Ireland's games at UEFA Euro 1988. He went on to become captain, leading to the nickname \"Captain Fantastic\", as per the title of his autobiography.[9][10]\n\nThe highlight of McCarthy's international career was the second-round penalty shoot-out win over Romania in the 1990 World Cup finals. This led to a crunch tie with hosts Italy in the quarter-final, where Ireland's first ever appearance in the finals came to an end, losing 1\u20130. McCarthy was the player who committed the most fouls in the 1990 tournament.[7]\n\nIn total, McCarthy won 57 caps for the Republic of Ireland; scoring two goals, one against Yugoslavia in April 1988,[11] the other against the United States in May 1992.[12]\n\nMcCarthy became player-manager at Millwall in March 1992, succeeding Bruce Rioch. In his first full season (1992\u201393), he was still registered as a player, but made only one further appearance (in the Anglo-Italian Cup), before he became solely a manager.[citation needed]\n\nHe took the club to the play-offs in 1993\u201394 after a strong third-place finish, but they lost out to Derby County in the semi-finals. During the 1995\u201396 season, McCarthy became the prime candidate for the vacant Republic of Ireland manager's job, after the resignation of Jack Charlton. After a protracted period of speculation, McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996, two days after his resignation at the club. Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure, Millwall would go on to suffer the drop (by virtue of goals scored) after McCarthy's departure.[citation needed]\n\nHis loan signings of the underachieving Russian internationals Sergei Yuran and Vassili Kulkov from Spartak Moscow, who each received a \u00a3150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team, would later be cited[by whom?] as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under Jimmy Nicholl, although it cannot be proven.[13]\n\nIn February 1996, McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of Jack Charlton. His first game in charge was a friendly international against Russia on 27 March which finished in a 0\u20132 defeat.[14]\n\nAfter two narrow failures to qualify for the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, McCarthy took the nation to the 2002 World Cup held in South Korea and Japan after a 2\u20131 play-off aggregate win against Iran.[15] Before the tournament, McCarthy was involved in a very public and bitter spat with star player Roy Keane, who was sent home the day before it began. The conflict occurred after Keane had questioned the quality of the preparations and facilities the team were using.[16]\n\nDespite this furore, McCarthy's team reached the second round but were eliminated by Spain in a penalty shoot-out (after having already missed and scored a penalty in normal time). In spite of this, the Keane issue remained, with the proportion of blame undecided. Many in Ireland sided with Keane \u2013 particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed \u2013 and demanded McCarthy's resignation both during and after the tournament. An independent inquiry into the organisation's handling of the squad's preparation later commissioned by the Football Association of Ireland created a damning report, leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation.[17]\n\nCriticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Ireland's qualifying campaign for Euro 2004. In particular, his persistence with several players and tactics that some perceived to be inadequate did him damage, as did a 4\u20132 away defeat to Russia and a 2\u20131 home defeat to Switzerland. Under mounting pressure, McCarthy resigned from the post on 5 November 2002.[18] During his 68 games in charge, the Republic of Ireland won 29, drew 20 and lost 19.[19]\n\nOn 12 March 2003, McCarthy was appointed manager of struggling Sunderland as an immediate replacement for Howard Wilkinson, who was sacked after six successive Premiership defeats left the club facing near-certain relegation.[20] The following season, after relegation, he took Sunderland to the First Division promotion play-offs, but lost in a penalty shoot-out to Crystal Palace after Palace had scored a stoppage-time equaliser.[21]\n\nMcCarthy completed the turnaround of the club in the 2004\u201305 season. The Black Cats returned to the Premier League as Football League Championship champions, amassing 94 points.[22] After a poor season and with the club 16 points from safety with only 10 games remaining, he was dismissed on 6 March 2006.[23]\n\nOn 21 July 2006, McCarthy was appointed manager at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, replacing Glenn Hoddle who had resigned a fortnight earlier. He signed a 12-month rolling contract[24] The team managed to make the promotion play-offs in his first season, where they lost out to local rivals West Bromwich Albion over two legs, losing 3\u20132 at Molineux and 1\u20130 at The Hawthorns.[25]\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season he took the club to within a single placing of a successive play-off finish, ending seventh, losing the coveted sixth place to Watford by a goal difference of only one.[26] The campaign had also seen him linked with the international positions of South Korea and his previous post as Republic of Ireland manager.[27]\n\nThe 2008\u201309 season started well for McCarthy as he won the August Championship Manager of the Month Award, after seeing his side reach the top of the table,[28] eventually going on to match Wolves' record start to a season (equaling the 1949\u201350 season). Wolves maintained their position at the top of the table over the following months, and McCarthy again won the Manager of the Month Award for November.[29] After maintaining top spot since October, McCarthy's Wolves secured promotion to the Premier League by beating QPR 1\u20130 on 18 April 2009. The following week McCarthy clinched his second Championship as a manager after a 1\u20131 draw at his hometown club Barnsley. He won the Championship Manager of the Season Award at the conclusion of the campaign, his side having led the table for 42 of 46 games.\n\nThe following season, McCarthy kept Wolves in the Premier League, his first success at this level in three attempts. The club assured safety with two games to spare, eventually finishing 15th, their best league finish since 1979\u201380, and their first ever survival in the modern Premier League. However, in the process of keeping the team in the top division, Wolves and McCarthy were fined \u00a325,000 for fielding a weakened team for a fixture at Manchester United and thus breaking the Premier League rule E20. The Premier League also stated that the club had failed to fulfil its obligations to the league and other clubs in the utmost good faith and was therefore in breach of Rule B13.[30]\n\nThe team spent the majority of the 2010\u201311 campaign mired in the relegation zone, yet managed to defeat the likes of Manchester City,[31] Manchester United,[32] Liverpool[33] and Chelsea.[34] A final day loss to Blackburn put them in danger of relegation, but results elsewhere meant they narrowly survived in 17th place, one point ahead of relegated Birmingham and Blackpool.[35] This gave McCarthy the distinction of being the first Wolves manager in thirty years to maintain the club's top flight position for two successive seasons.\n\nThe 2011\u201312 season began well for McCarthy and, after three games, his team topped the Premier League with 7 points.[36] However, results tailed off and by January they had once again entered the relegation zone after nine games without victory. That same season Wolves sold \u00a315\u00a0million worth of players and with the board allowing McCarthy to spend just \u00a312\u00a0million it seemed inevitable when McCarthy was sacked as Wolves manager on 13 February 2012[37] after a run of poor results, culminating in a 5\u20131 home defeat to local rivals West Bromwich Albion.[38]\n\nOn 1 November 2012, McCarthy was appointed manager at Championship side Ipswich Town[39] on a two and a half-year contract.[39] McCarthy's appointment came in the wake of Paul Jewell's departure by mutual consent. McCarthy won his first match in charge as Ipswich manager on 3 November 2012, away at Birmingham, 0\u20131. This broke a 12 match winless run[40] in the league, 13 matches in all competitions. McCarthy guided Ipswich past Burnley on 10 November \u2013 the first home win since March after a late DJ Campbell winner. The match ended 2\u20131.[41] With a win against Nottingham Forest in late November, his sixth game in charge, McCarthy had successfully guided Ipswich out of the relegation zone.[42] McCarthy's Ipswich stopped Millwall's 13-match unbeaten run with a 3\u20130 home win on 8 December. On 2 February 2013, McCarthy's assistant Terry Connor took charge of a 4\u20130 rout of Middlesbrough while McCarthy was ill. McCarthy then guided Ipswich to safety, finally finishing in 14th place. Prior to the 2013\u201314 season, McCarthy had signed 10 new players. McCarthy's first full season in charge of Ipswich ended with the club finishing in 9th place.[citation needed]\n\nOn 30 June 2014, McCarthy and Terry Connor agreed a new three-year deal with Ipswich.[43] The following season he led the club to their first appearance in the Championship playoffs in ten years with a sixth-placed finish, before losing out to rivals Norwich City in the semi-finals.[citation needed] During the 2015\u201316 season McCarthy and assistant Terry Connor renewed their contracts for a further two seasons, with the option to extend until 2020. McCarthy led Ipswich to a 7th-place finish in his third full season at Portman Road.[44] McCarthy's fourth full season in charge ended in a 16th-place finish.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, Ipswich Town announced that McCarthy would be leaving the club at the end of the 2017\u201318 season on the expiry of his contract, along with assistant manager Terry Connor, after talks with owner Marcus Evans.[45] His final season with the club was marred by a fractured relationship between him and the club's supporters, with many supporters voicing their dissatisfaction with McCarthy's defensive style of play and McCarthy branding them as \"numbskulls\".[46] He left the club earlier than expected on 10 April 2018, shortly after a 1\u20130 home win over Barnsley.[47][48]\n\nOn 25 November 2018, McCarthy was appointed manager of Republic of Ireland for the second time in his career, replacing Martin O'Neill.[49][50][51] Robbie Keane, a legend for the national team, was appointed as one of McCarthy's assistant coaches, alongside Terry Connor, who had previously assisted McCarthy at both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town.[51]\n\nIn March 2019, McCarthy won his first two games in charge, by defeating both Gibraltar and Georgia, in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers in Group D, by 1\u20130.[52][53]\nIn June 2019, the national team drew 1\u20131 away to Denmark, before defeating Gibraltar once again, this time by 2\u20130, at the Aviva Stadium; four days later, McCarthy guided them to the top the Group D table, having taken ten points after four games.[54][55]\n\nOn 5 September 2019, McCarthy's side once again came from behind to draw 1\u20131 with Switzerland, which enabled them to remain at the top of their qualifying group, with three matches to play remaining.[56] However, a disappointing 0-0 draw in Georgia, followed by defeat in Switzerland, left Ireland needing a win at home to Denmark to secure a top two spot. A 1-1 draw saw the Irish needing to win the play-offs to qualify. On 4 April 2020, amid the global coronavirus pandemic, McCarthy stood down as manager and was immediately replaced by Stephen Kenny, who had been in charge of the nation's under-21s, for the play-offs.[57]\n\nMcCarthy joined Cypriot First Division club APOEL as manager on 2 November 2020; he signed a contract until 2022.[58] He was sacked by the club on 5 January 2021 following a run of 2 wins, 1 draw and 5 defeats in his 8 games in charge.[59]\n\nOn 22 January 2021, McCarthy was appointed as manager of Cardiff City, following the sacking of Neil Harris. He signed a contract until the end of the season.[60] His reign started with games against two of his former teams from his playing-days; Barnsley and Millwall \u2013 both of which ended as draws. His first win as Cardiff manager came in the following game, a 2\u20130 win against Bristol City.[61] After making an unbeaten start to his reign at the club, a run that included a six-game winning streak, McCarthy signed a new two-year deal with the club on 4 March 2021.[62] Cardiff finished the season in 8th place.\n\nDespite losing one of their opening six matches at the start of the following season, a run of results followed which saw Cardiff drop as low as 21st in the table. On 23 October 2021, after suffering a club-record eighth successive loss of the season at the hands of Middlesbrough, McCarthy left the club by mutual consent.[63]\n\nOn 19 January 2023, McCarthy was appointed head coach of the Championship's second-bottom placed club Blackpool on a short-term contract until the end of the season.[64]\n\nMcCarthy's brother-in-law is Robert Elstone, formerly Chief Executive of Everton F.C..[65]\n\nBarnsley\n\nManchester City\n\nCeltic\n\nIndividual\n\nSunderland\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_McCarthy"}, {"id": 164, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/28/545611/original/barry-ferguson-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Barry Ferguson", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/barry-ferguson/545611", "desc": "Barry Ferguson  (born 2 February 1978) is a Scottish football coach, former player and pundit who is currently the manager of Kelty Hearts. \nFerguson spent most of his playing career at Rangers, in two spells either side of a \u00a37.5 million transfer to English club Blackburn Rovers.

He also helped Rangers to reach the 2008 UEFA Cup final.\n\nFerguson made 45 appearances for the Scotland national team, starting from 1998. In 2009, following behavioural incidents while on national duty, he was stripped of the captaincy of Rangers and told he would no longer be considered for international selection.[7][8]\n\nLater in his career, he returned to England with Birmingham City, Blackpool and Fleetwood Town. Towards the end of his playing spell with Blackpool, he served as caretaker manager of the club.

He became manager of Kelty Hearts in October 2018, and he left them in May 2021 after guiding them to promotion to the SPFL for the first time. Ferguson then became manager of Alloa Athletic soon after, but left the club on 14 February after a run of one win in eleven games.\n\nBorn in Hamilton into a Rangers-supporting family,[2] Ferguson's older brother, Derek, had played for the club in the same position in the 1980s, with the younger sibling often being invited behind the scenes at Ibrox Stadium as a child.[9][10][11]\n\nAround the age of 8 he began playing for Mill United in Hamilton.[12] In his early teens, although highly rated, he suffered rejection by the Scotland Schoolboys, at trials in Largs, due to his 5\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches (1.65\u00a0m)[12] stature.[13] He made it into the last thirty or so candidates, however. \"When I got out of the car, I went up and lay on my bed and thought to myself, 'You know what?

Two or three years later, you're beginning to chap the first-team door, and you're walking past [the people who said you wouldn't make it] and they're saying, 'I knew you were going to do it.'\"[12]\n\nHaving trained with Rangers since 1991, Ferguson signed a professional contract upon finishing his education at Brannock High School in 1994.[5][6][13] Aside from his brother, Ferguson's idol was Ian Durrant, who was still an important player when he joined the club.[13][14]\n\nFerguson was promoted to the first-team squad for the 1996\u201397 season. He made his debut on the last day of that season against Hearts on 10 May 1997.[6] He made a number of sporadic appearances the following season under manager Walter Smith's policy of easing him into the first team.\n\nFerguson became a regular fixture in the first team during the 1998\u201399 season under new manager Dick Advocaat (displacing fellow youth graduate Charlie Miller).[15] The Dutchman soon secured Ferguson on a long-term contract as he became an important member of the squad. He scored his first career goal in a League Cup match against Alloa Athletic on 18 August 1998, and played against his brother on three occasions during that season when Rangers faced Dunfermline Athletic, with a 20-year-old Ferguson scoring his first league goal in the match at East End Park. His brother, then 31 years old, made his last appearance at Ibrox in the reverse fixture.[11][16] Injury prevented him from being involved in the 1998\u201399 season run-in as the club achieved the treble; Ferguson watched the 1999 Scottish Cup final from the stands as Rangers won by a single goal, scored by Rod Wallace three minutes into the second half.\n\nFerguson was so influential the following season that he was given an extended six-year deal at Rangers in October 1999. He was named the Scottish Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for 1999\u20132000, a season in which Rangers retained the Premier League and Scottish Cup, beating Aberdeen in the final.[17]\n\nFerguson received minor facial injuries after engaging in a drunken hotel brawl following a 6\u20132 defeat to Celtic in August 2000. After being sent off in the match, he had made obscene gestures to the crowd and then went drinking in Bothwell in his club tracksuit.[18][19] When the club crashed out of the UEFA Champions League group stage at the hands of AS Monaco, largely because of a mistake by captain Lorenzo Amoruso,[20] the Italian was stripped of the captaincy and it instead went to the 22-year-old Ferguson.[21] An incident in which two bags of ice were thrown at the Celtic dug-out during a 2\u20130 defeat at Ibrox in September 2001 was attributed to Ferguson, who was criticised for his petulance and immaturity.[22][23] Celtic manager Martin O'Neill played down the incident, saying he thought the ice had been thrown by his club's doctor.[24] The young Ferguson went on to successfully guide his team to a League Cup[25] and Scottish Cup later that season under manager Alex McLeish, who had replaced Advocaat in December 2001. In the latter final, another Old Firm clash, Ferguson tied the score at 2\u20132 with a free kick (Peter Lovenkrands scored the winning goal).[26]\n\nDuring their second season together, 2002\u201303, Ferguson captained the side to a domestic treble.[27] After scoring 18 goals from midfield, he also won Scottish Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year and Scottish PFA Players' Player of the Year.\n\nOn 29 August 2003, Ferguson joined Premier League club Blackburn Rovers for a fee of \u00a37.5\u00a0million.[28] With Everton also chasing Ferguson,[29] Rangers had initially denied that he was leaving.[30] He made his Blackburn debut in a Premier League match against Liverpool on 19 September at Ewood Park,[31] and scored his first goal against the same team, also at Ewood Park, during a League Cup match on 29 October.[32]\n\nGraeme Souness made Ferguson captain of Blackburn in July 2004 and he seemed to be adapting well to Premiership football, despite the team still struggling and a managerial change, which saw Mark Hughes replacing Souness. However, after 16 months at the club, including a lengthy period out through injury after fracturing his kneecap in a Premiership match against Newcastle United,[33] during the January 2005 transfer window, Ferguson submitted a written transfer request, admitting that the draw of playing in the Premiership and a Lancashire derby could not compare with an Old Firm match, nor could the team's desire to win be matched.[34][35]\n\nAfter much discussion between the clubs, a fee of \u00a34.5\u00a0million was agreed and Ferguson rejoined Rangers just before the close of the transfer window.[36] Ferguson later said that the fee Rangers paid was actually \u00a3100,000 plus the fees Blackburn owed from the original transfer.[citation needed] Ferguson's second debut for Rangers came in a League Cup semi-final victory over Dundee United. He was a 69th-minute substitute for Alex Rae during the 7\u20131 win. His first goal after his return was the opening goal in a 1\u20131 draw against Inverness CT on 5 March 2005. Ferguson played in the 2005 Scottish League Cup final[6] and was part of the Rangers team that won the league title on the last day of the season.[37]\n\nAt the start of the 2005\u201306 season, manager Alex McLeish re-appointed Ferguson as club captain. McLeish had not wanted to remove the captaincy mid-season from Fernando Ricksen. Ferguson played the latter part of the season carrying an ankle injury as Rangers ended up in a third-place finish in the Premier League. At the end of the season, Ferguson revealed that he had snapped ligaments and confessed that he should have undergone the surgery sooner.[38]\n\nAfter an incident in the dressing room at Caledonian Stadium, Inverness, on 27 December 2006,[39] it was announced on BBC Radio Scotland's New Year's Day broadcast of Sportsound that Ferguson had been stripped of the Rangers captaincy after a meeting with then manager Paul Le Guen. He was also dropped from the squad for the next match. Later Le Guen claimed Ferguson was undermining him.[40] \"I'll go on record as saying I never had one bust-up with him, never had one argument with him. I don't know where all this comes from,\" explained Ferguson eleven years later.[35] \"No disrespect to Inverness Caley \u2013 they had good players, no doubt \u2013 but we we're Rangers here. We were dropping points against teams that we should be beating. So, I let it out a wee bit. There was no arguments, nothing in the dressing room. After I had said that, we flew back down to Glasgow. We were playing Motherwell next, I think, and I came in the day of, or the day before, the Motherwell game. I came in, put my bag down, Yves Colleu, who was the assistant manager, comes in and says, 'Paul wants to speak to you'. I went into his office and went to sit down, and [Le Guen] said, 'Don't sit down. That's you finished; you won't play with Rangers again.'\"[35]\n\nThe match at Motherwell was won 1\u20130 by Rangers, and goalscorer Kris Boyd reportedly showed solidarity with the deposed skipper by holding up six fingers, in reference to Ferguson's shirt number.[41] Following the resignation of Le Guen as manager on 4 January,[42] Ferguson was re-instated to the Rangers side by caretaker manager Ian Durrant[14] and was also re-appointed as captain. Later that year, sports journalist Graham Spiers published Paul Le Guen: Enigma, documenting his tenure at the club. According to Spiers, Le Guen left because he was being \"undermined\" by other Rangers personnel, including Ferguson and then club doctor, Ian McGuinness.[43]\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season began with Ferguson scoring twice in the first SPL match against Inverness.[44] His scoring form continued and he netted the second in a 3\u20130 win over rivals Celtic, as well as in the UEFA Champions League against VfB Stuttgart.[45] The Old Firm goal was Ferguson's first against Celtic since the 2002 Scottish Cup Final.\n\nIn January 2008, he scored a controversial goal in Rangers' 2007\u201308 Scottish League Cup semi-final win against Hearts. He later admitted to handling the ball in the buildup to the goal but that the infringement was unintentional.[46] Rangers went on to win both the League Cup final and the Scottish Cup final.[47]\n\nOn 14 May 2008, Ferguson made his 400th appearance for Rangers in the UEFA Cup Final against Zenit Saint Petersburg at the City of Manchester Stadium; he captained the side to a 2\u20130 defeat.[48]\n\nThe summer of 2008 saw Ferguson undergo an operation on a fresh injury problem that would see him ruled out until early November;[49] the injury was not the same one that plagued him towards the end of the season prior.[49] He returned to the first team on 1 November in a 5\u20130 league win over Inverness at Ibrox.\n\nIn April 2009, after an extended hotel drinking session with Rangers teammate Allan McGregor after Scotland's defeat to the Netherlands,[50] followed by both players making inappropriate gestures while on the bench during the next match against Iceland, Ferguson was stripped of the captain's armband for both club and country.[7] He recovered from this setback to help Rangers win the 2009 Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk[51] (his last match for the club, having not started since the Scotland incident). Rangers also won the SPL title[52] but missed out on another treble with a defeat in the 2009 Scottish League Cup Final.[53]\n\nFerguson was inducted into the Rangers F.C. Hall of Fame in 2004 at the age of 26.[6]\n\nFerguson made 82 appearances in European competitions, all of them for Rangers,[54][55] which made him the record European appearance holder at the club.[56] Ferguson overtook David Narey's record for the number of European appearances made whilst playing for a Scottish club by starting in a UEFA Cup match against Werder Bremen. He broke Kenny Dalglish's record for the number of competitive European appearances by a Scottish footballer when he played in his 80th match in Europe, against Sporting CP.\n\nOn 17 July 2009, Ferguson completed a move to English Premier League newcomers Birmingham City on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee,[57] reported as \"in the region of \u00a31.2m\".[58] Joining up with boss Alex McLeish once again,[6] the former Rangers manager said that Ferguson has \"unfinished business in England\" and that he believed the former Scottish international to be  \"very capable of competing with the best players in the Premier League.\"[59] He made his debut in the opening game of the season, against Manchester United on 15 August 2009, and his first goal for the club came as the only goal of the FA Cup third round replay against Nottingham Forest in January 2010.[60] Ferguson won the Birmingham City players' Player of the Year award for 2009\u201310.[61]\n\nFerguson helped Birmingham beat Arsenal in the 2011 League Cup Final at Wembley, despite playing the last hour of the game with a broken rib.[62] During both of his two seasons with Birmingham, Ferguson made over two thousand passes without recording an assist.[63] In season 2009\u201310 Ferguson had the highest number of completed passes of any player in the Barclays Premier League, according to Opta statistics.[64]\n\nWith Birmingham needing to reduce their wage bill following their relegation from the Premier League, Ferguson joined Championship club Blackpool on 22 July 2011 for an undisclosed fee, reported to be around \u00a3750,000. This enabled him to move closer to his family in Scotland, and he signed a two-year deal, with the option of staying on for a further year.[65][66][67] He was given the captain's armband (taking over from Charlie Adam, who had departed for Liverpool) for the club's opening League fixture at Hull City on 5 August.[68]\n\nFerguson scored his first goal for the Seasiders in a 2\u20130 victory over Ipswich Town at Bloomfield Road on 10 September.[69] It was his first goal in English league football for seven years.\n\nIn late October 2012, after a falling out with chairman Karl Oyston, Ferguson was made to train with the Blackpool youth team. Early the following month, he received a call from Micky Mellon, manager of nearby Fleetwood Town. Although he doubted Ferguson would want to play in League Two, Mellon put forward the offer of coming on loan. Ferguson accepted, the only such move of his career, and spent three months at Highbury Avenue.[12]\n\nFerguson was reinstated to the side by Paul Ince on 20 February in his first game in charge, a 2\u20130 defeat at Leeds United. He had been named as a substitute for the previous couple of games, under the caretaker-managership of Steve Thompson. He was given the captain's armband, in the absence of Alex Baptiste, for the home victory over Derby County on 26 April.\n\nIn October 2013, Ferguson had a sixth and final operation on his ankle,[70] which kept him out until 3 December. \"After the surgery, the surgeon said, \"Right, it's over. Don't try [playing] again.\"[70]\n\nOn 21 January 2014, Ferguson was installed as Blackpool's caretaker manager in the wake of Ince's sacking.[71] \"I didn't want to take it, but nobody else would take the job,\" Ferguson explained in 2020. \"And it was a chance to keep the club up.\"[70] He initially stated that he would not be playing while in the managerial role,[72] but on 12 April, at Leeds, he named himself in the starting line-up in an attempt to stave off the threat of relegation. \"Bob [Malcolm] says to me, 'You'll need to come back in.' I said, 'Bob, I've not trained for six weeks.' He said, 'You'll need to come back and play; we're struggling.'\"[73]\n\nAlthough Blackpool won only three of their twenty games with Ferguson in charge, they avoided relegation by two points.[74] Ferguson left Blackpool at the end of the 2013\u201314 season.[75]\n\nFerguson made twelve appearances for Scotland's under-21 team.[76] He made his full international debut at the age of 20 against Lithuania on 5 September 1998.[77] However, an injury-plagued season prevented him from picking up more caps. Indeed, Ferguson did not return to the Scotland set up until a year later, starting in a 2\u20131 win against Bosnia-Herzegovina on 4 September 1999.\n\nHe was appointed captain of the national side in 2004 by then-manager Berti Vogts, following the retirement of Paul Lambert. Ferguson captained Scotland a total of 28 times. He led the side to a single-goal victory over former World Champions France 1\u20130 at the Parc des Princes in Paris on 12 September 2007. This completed a double-header of single-goal victories against the French during the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying campaign.\n\nFerguson received criticism for being a disruptive influence on the team despite captaining his country for years.[78] On 3 April 2009, he was banned from ever representing Scotland again after serious breaches of squad discipline,[8] and the captain's armband was given to Darren Fletcher. Additionally, Ferguson's club, Rangers, stripped him of the captain's role and suspended him for two weeks without pay.[7]\n\nFollowing the dismissal of George Burley as manager of Scotland, SFA chief executive Gordon Smith confirmed that the incoming manager would be free to select Ferguson should he so wish.[79] On 6 July 2010, Scotland coach Craig Levein confirmed that Ferguson will not play for Scotland again. Levein had hoped he would return, but Ferguson informed him that he wanted to focus on club football instead.[80]\n\nIn June 2014,[81] Ferguson was appointed player-manager of Scottish League Two club Clyde. Clyde were drawn away to Rangers in the Challenge Cup after a 2\u20130 home win against Ayr United; Rangers won 8\u20131.[82] On 27 September, Ferguson made his playing debut against Annan Athletic in a 1\u20131 draw at Broadwood, but came off early in the second half with an injury.[83] Towards the end of the 2\u20130 defeat to Lowland League club Spartans in the second round of the Scottish Cup, Ferguson was sent to the stands after a verbal altercation with Clyde supporters.[84] In April 2015, Ferguson said that he had retired as a player.[85]\n\nIn his second season at Clyde, the team came third and reached the play-offs, in which they defeated Elgin City 5\u20131 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[86] In the final, however, they lost 3\u20132 to Queen's Park, despite winning the second leg 1\u20130 at Hampden.[87] Clyde went on a poor run of form during his third season, failing to win a league match in December, January or February.[88] With the club sitting in eighth place in late February, Ferguson resigned.[88]\n\nIn October 2018, Ferguson had discussions with Lowland League club Kelty Hearts about becoming their new manager.[89] He was offered and accepted the position later that month.[90] Hearts finished third in the Lowland League in Ferguson's first season in charge.[91] They won the championship the following season, 2019\u201320, after it was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[92]\n\nFerguson guided Kelty into the SPFL for the first time in their history when they beat Brechin City over two legs in the Scottish League Two play-offs at the end of the 2020\u201321 campaign.[93] The result also ended Brechin City's 67-year stint in the senior leagues.[93] A day after the play-offs ended, Ferguson left Kelty.[94]\n\nShortly after leaving Kelty, Ferguson was appointed manager of Alloa Athletic.[95] After struggling in the league, the club announced on 14 February 2022 that Ferguson had tendered his resignation.[96]\n\nFerguson regularly appears on STV's Peter & Roughie's Football Show and the online sports show PLZ Soccer \u2013 Football Show. He also has a regular column in the Daily Record newspaper.[97]\n\nFerguson is married to Margaret, a trained psychologist.[70] They have three children: Connor, Kyle and Cara.[98][99] His son, Kyle, is also a professional footballer, a centre back who signed for Harrogate Town in June 2022.[100]\n\nDuring the 2014 Scottish independence referendum Ferguson was a supporter of the Better Together campaign against Scottish independence.[101]\n\nIn July 2017 it was reported that Ferguson successfully applied for bankruptcy after running up debts of \u00a31,425,633, whilst having only \u00a33,000 worth of assets to help pay off his creditors.[102] Ferguson exited bankruptcy in July 2018, having co-operated with an insolvency firm.[103]\n\nScores and results list Scotland's goal tally first.\n\n\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Ferguson"}, {"id": 165, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/42/827300/original/david-whelan-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Dave Whelan", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/david-whelan/827300", "desc": "David Whelan (born 24 November 1936) is an English former footballer.

He is also owner of the DW Stadium, home to Football League", "full_desc": "\n\nDavid Whelan (born 24 November 1936)[3] is an English businessman and former footballer. During his football career, he played for Blackburn Rovers and Crewe Alexandra. Whelan is the former owner of club Wigan Athletic, having also been the chairman of the club for twenty years, before passing the position over to his grandson, David Sharpe, who eventually passed the ownership over to International Entertainment Corporation.[4]\n\nWhelan was born in Bradford and raised in Wigan. His forebears hailed from County Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nWhelan played 78 times as a left back, scoring three times, for Blackburn Rovers and was a member of its 1960 FA Cup Final team, which lost 3\u20130 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Whelan himself did not complete the game, a feisty challenge from Whelan on Norman Deeley culminated in the Blackburn man being withdrawn before half time due to a broken leg. Whelan's injury is one of many serious injuries suffered by players in the 1950\u201360 era and was known as the Wembley hoodoo.[5] Following his leg break, Whelan was sold to Crewe Alexandra, where he made his debut on 23 February 1963 in a 4\u20130 first round League Cup defeat at Port Vale, and notched up 115 appearances through to April 1966.[6] He then retired to concentrate on developing a retail grocery business.\n\nWhelan started out a market stall on Wigan market after working with Howarth Brothers on their stall in Blackburn. He later progressed into a grocers, before visiting America where he studied the self-service supermarket. He returned to England and set about creating a supermarket chain. By the late 1960s the business had 10 stores based across Lancashire.[7] In 1978 Whelan sold the business to Morrisons for \u00a31.5 million.\n\nWhelan acquired a Wigan based fishing and sports store JJ Bradburns in 1971. He continued to use the company name JJB Sports (JJB are the initials of the two previous owners John Jarvis Broughton, followed by J J Bradburn) and continued the retail of sports goods. By 1980, JJB had seven stores, and continued to expand throughout the 80s and 90s, to become the UK's second biggest sports retailer, focused mainly on sports clothing.\n\nIn 2005, JJB Sports was fined \u00a35.5 million by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for fixing the price of the English National Team and Manchester United shirts in 2000 and 2001.[8] Which? (the Consumers' Association) issued proceedings against JJB, suing for damages on behalf of consumers affected by the price fixing. Whelan gradually scaled down his interests in the company, and in 2005 stepped down as chairman.[9] However, in October 2006, he personally intervened to overturn the settlement of a pay dispute at JJB's Wigan warehouse negotiated by new chairman Tom Knight, branding it \"the equivalent of Communism\", prompting a two-day strike.[10]\n\nIn January 2007 he sold \u00a350m worth of shares in JJB,[11] before selling his remaining 29% stake in June 2007. This action was in breach of an agreement Whelan had with the stock exchange on 26 January 2007, whereby he undertook to make no further disposals for the following 12 months.[12][13]\n\nIn March 2009, Whelan acquired back troubled JJB's nationwide chain of fitness clubs and stores. Wigan Athletic's stadium became the DW Stadium and their new sponsor, DW Sports Fitness, taking the initials of its owner and his new company.[14]\n\nWhelan bought Wigan Athletic in February 1995, when they were a Division Three team.[15] After Whelan took the reins he announced that he would get Wigan Athletic into the Premier League, a promise he fulfilled in 2005. This began with the Division Three title in 1996\u201397, the Division Two title in 2002\u201303 and promotion to the Premiership as Championship runners-up in 2004\u201305. He funded the \u00a330 million construction of the club's new JJB Stadium (now the DW Stadium) which opened in 1999 and on its completion was one of the largest football stadiums outside the Premier League.[16]\n\nWigan, who were tipped to be relegated from the Premier League in their first season, not only managed to stay up (and remained in the top flight for eight years), but claimed a 10th place league position[17] and also reached the final of the Football League Cup.[18]\n\nIn 2005, Whelan threatened to quit the club unless the price of policing games was reduced.[19]\n\nIn 2007, he called for the relegation of West Ham United as punishment for their incorrect registration of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano.[20] He subsequently called for Premier League Chairman Dave Richards and chief executive Richard Scudamore to resign.[21]\n\nAn arbitration committee met to consider the affair. It ruled in favour of the Premier League. Wigan managed an end-of-season victory at Sheffield United, a 2\u20131 win with the goals being scored by Paul Scharner in the 14th minute and a penalty from David Unsworth in injury time of the first half, after Jon Stead had equalised for Sheffield United in the 38th minute. It was a dramatic final-day Premiership survival story, with the result saving Wigan and condemning Sheffield United to the Championship.[22]\n\nOn 11 May 2013, in a dramatic ending to the FA Cup Final against Manchester City, Ben Watson scored a header in the 91st minute to win the game 1\u20130. This was Wigan's first major trophy in their Premier League history and gave Whelan the chance to hold the FA Cup trophy, 53 years after breaking his leg as a 1960 finalist.[22] Three days later, a defeat to Arsenal saw Wigan relegated to the Championship, ending a spell of eight years in the Premier League. On 3 March 2015, Whelan stepped down as chairman, appointing his 23-year-old grandson, David Sharpe, as the new chairman.\n\nAfter the announcement of Maurice Lindsay's intention to retire immediately from the club after the Warriors' loss at the hands of Catalans Dragons on 29 July 2007, Whelan managed to persuade him to stay on until the end of the season. After the announcement of Lindsay's retirement however, Whelan said he would be willing to sell the club after a proposed takeover from a \"genuine Wigan fan\" earlier in the year.[23]\n\nOn 24 October 2007, it was announced that Ian Lenagan, former owner of Harlequins RL, had completed his takeover of Wigan Warriors, buying out Whelan's 89% stake in the club with the deal taking effect from 1 December 2007.[24]\n\nWigan Warriors Rugby League Club Chairman Maurice Lindsay and business tycoon Dave Whelan, the then owner of the JJB Sports empire, had already been making noises about forming a rugby union side. Initial contact was made via Whelan's Finance Director Simon Moorehead and an exciting night saw the members promised \u00a310,000,000 investment over 5 years, with Mr Whelan expressing the dream to be drinking red wine away to Toulouse in the European Cup in the not-too-distant future. Wide-eyed, and with these promises of future success, the members reluctantly sold their shares in the club for \u00a31,000 each, to the new owners, with Lindsay becoming the club's new Chairman.[25]\n\nA supporter of the Conservative Party, Whelan has donated in total \u00a31.5 million to the party since 2007, with his most recent donation of \u00a3100,000 made in August 2014.[26] He said David Cameron had his full support.[27]\n\nIn 2013, he called for a mandatory minute's silence at all football games to mark the death of Margaret Thatcher. The Football Association rejected the proposal.[28]\n\nIn November 2014, Whelan was accused of making antisemitic statements, following an interview he gave The Guardian, defending his decision to hire Malky Mackay as manager of Wigan. Mackay was under investigation by the FA for alleged racism and antisemitism in e-mails and text messages he sent while manager of Cardiff City. During the interview, Whelan was quoted as saying \"Jewish people chase money more than everybody else.\"[29]\t\nThe statements were condemned by West Ham United co-chairman David Gold and former FA and Premier League executive Simon Johnson, both of whom are Jewish.[30] Whelan was also accused of racist attitudes by defending Mackay's alleged referral to Chinese people as \"chinks\".

He played intermittently over the next few years and his final appearance came on 21 March 1891 against a Scotland eleven. Scotland also played an official international against Wales on the same day as this match.[4] However, the match against Corinthians was treated as a practice for the match against England, and was considered more important than the game against Wales.[5] The Scots won the match 9\u20132 with four goals from Frank Watt, and two each from William Sellar and Davie Baird. All three were selected for the forthcoming England international, with Watt scoring a late consolation goal as England won 2\u20131.[6][7]\n\nAltogether, Jackson made thirteen appearances for Corinthian, without scoring.[8]\n\nOn 7 March 1891, three weeks before the Scotland XI v.

He has been the subject of controversy, courting numerous arguments at the club and international level during his professional career.\n\nDenisov was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and started his footballing career with Turbostroitel before going to Smena, the youth team of Zenit.[2] Denisov signed his first professional contract with Zenit, St. Petersburg's only professional team, after graduating school in 2002.[3] At the age of 18, Denisov made his debut for Zenit in a league match against CSKA Moscow in 2002.[4] He made his breakthrough with the club the following year, scoring twice in 19 appearances.[3]\n\nUnder Dutch manager Dick Advocaat, Denisov blossomed as a player, developing into an advanced midfield role behind Andrey Arshavin and Aleksandr Kerzhakov, becoming an influential member of the Zenit squad that won their first Russian Premier League title in 2007.[3][5] On 3 April 2008, Denisov scored Zenit's fourth goal in their 4\u20131 first leg defeat of Bayer Leverkusen in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup match at the BayArena.[6] Denisov's performances helped Zenit reach the final against Scottish side Rangers on 15 May, after defeating Bayern Munich 5\u20131 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[7] In the final, Denisov played the full ninety minutes and opened the scoring in the 72nd minute after being played in by winger Andrei Arshavin.[3] Zenit went on to win the match 2\u20130 and lift the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history.[8] In the resulting UEFA Super Cup, Denisov played the full ninety again, assisting Pavel Pogrebnyak's headed goal as Zenit upset English heavyweight Manchester United 2\u20131 on 29 August 2008.[9]\n\nOn 29 June 2010, Denisov extended his contract with Zenit for a further five years.[2] Six months later, on 22 December, Denisov was voted by the fans as the club's \"Player of the Year\", beating out the likes of playmaker Danny and goalkeeper Vyacheslav Malafeev.[10]\n\nOn 27 October 2011, Denisov featured in his 300th competitive fixture for Zenit, in the 3\u20130 defeat of Volga, including 217 matches in the Premier League, 55 in European competition and 28 matches in domestic cup competitions.[11] Denisov finished as runner up behind Malafeev as the club's MVP for the 2011\u201312 campaign, playing 57 games (starting all of them) whilst scoring one goal and providing eight assists.[12] During the Russian Football Union awards ceremony on 26 May, Denisov was voted as the \"Player of the Year\" in the Russian Premier League and Zenit won five more club awards for 2011\u201312 including \"Team of the Year.\"[13]\n\nOn 11 August 2012, Denisov provided two assists in Zenit's 5\u20130 defeat of Spartak Moscow.[14] On 3 September, Denisov was voted as Zenit's \"Player of the Month\" for August after playing all five league games and providing those two assists.[15] Three weeks later, Denisov was demoted to the reserve team for improper behavior according to the club.[16] Following more than a month with the youth side, Denisov was reinstated to the senior squad and began training with them again on 1 November.[17] He made his return to the first team a day later, coming on as a 58th-minute substitute for Viktor Fayzulin in Zenit's 2\u20131 defeat of FC Rostov.[18] Denisov's first full match since his return from exile with the youth team came on 6 November in a Champions League group game against RSC Anderlecht, playing the full ninety minutes in a 1\u20130 loss in Belgium.[19]\n\nDenisov announced his move to Russian Premier League club Anzhi Makhachkala for a fee of 15 million euros on 21 June 2013.[20]\n\nOn 15 August 2013, Denisov moved along with fellow Anzhi players Yuriy Zhirkov and Aleksandr Kokorin to FC Dynamo for an undisclosed fee. Denisov played in only three matches for Anzhi before the cash-strapped club began to sell its players.\n\nIn April 2015, Denisov was put up for sale by Dynamo and told to train on his own for insulting head coach Stanislav Cherchesov.[21][22]\n\nHe returned to Dynamo's lineup in July 2015, after Cherchesov was dismissed as Dynamo's manager and replaced by Andrey Kobelev.\n\nOn 31 August 2016, he moved on loan to FC Lokomotiv Moscow for the remainder of the 2016\u201317 season.[23] On 2 February 2017, he signed a permanent deal with Lokomotiv that started at the end of the season upon the expiration of his Dynamo contract.[24]\n\nOn 27 May 2019, he left Lokomotiv by mutual consent.[25] On 29 May 2019, he announced through his lawyers that he retired from playing.[26]\n\nDenisov first featured in the Russian national set up, representing the Under-19 side against Denmark in the second qualifying round for the 2003 UEFA U-19 European Championships.[27] He then went on to captain the Russia U-21 team. Denisov trained with Russia in 2005 but did not get into the team.[2]\n\nAfter a good run of performances at the club level with Zenit, many sports journalists called for Denisov to be included in the squad for the European Championships in 2008, but he did not make the initial squad and later refused to be called up for the provisional 25-man squad of players after a number of injuries.[28] Denisov made his debut for Russia on 11 October 2008 in a FIFA World Cup 2010 qualifier against Germany, a 2\u20131 loss at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund.[3][29]\n\nHe was confirmed for the finalized UEFA Euro 2012 squad on 25 May 2012.[30] He featured in all three Group A matches,[citation needed] as Russia picked up four points but ultimately failed to qualify for the knockout stage due to their head-to-head record with Greece.[31]\n\nOn 7 September 2012, Denisov was appointed by new Russia manager Fabio Capello as the captain of the national team in the wake of Andrei Arshavin's absence.[citation needed]\n\nOn 2 June 2014, he was included in Russia's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad.[32]\n\nOn 6 June 2016, Denisov was ruled out of Euro 2016 with a thigh injury.\n\nThroughout his career, Denisov has earned a reputation for poor behavior both at the club level with Zenit and at the international level with Russia. In the run up to the European Championships in 2008, Denisov was left out of the original 23-man squad by then manager Guus Hiddink;[33] Denisov was called into the squad after a number of injuries but took umbrage and refused to play as Russia reached the semi-finals losing to eventual champions Spain.[34]\n\nIn August 2010, he was involved in a road rage incident, where he fought a driving instructor after the learner driver in the instructor's car almost collided with Denisov's SUV. Denisov injured his foot in the incident and broke the instructor's nose. The instructor refused to press charges.[35]\n\nIn September 2010, Denisov was involved in a training ground bust up with coach Vladislav Radimov, the argument escalated from a call Radimov made in a practice game and reports claim that Denisov was readying to punch Radimov before teammates physically stopped him.[36] Two months later in a match against Spartak Moscow, Denisov verbally abused Spartak's manager Valery Karpin, subsequently leading to a brawl with both sets of players and a four match ban for the combative midfielder.[citation needed]\n\nOn 22 September 2012, Denisov was left off the teamsheet for Zenit's 2\u20132 away draw with Krylya Sovetov. The following day, the club issued a statement that read, \"The decision to send Igor Denisov to the youth team for an indefinite period... is connected to the fact that the player issued an ultimatum, refusing to take to the field against Krylya Sovetov after demanding a renegotiation of his contract.\"[37] According to the Zenit website, Denisov's current contract runs to 2015 and that he is one of the highest earners in all of the Russian Premier League.[38] Media speculation reported that this pay strike was a result of Zenit's overhaul in the transfer market, bringing in Axel Witsel and Hulk on big contracts and in combined deals worth over $130 million. Denisov replied in an interview with Sport Express, stating that his stand-off with club management was over \"The proper organisation of the team. And respect for the Russian players which Zenit has always relied upon.\"[39] Two months after his protest, Denisov released a statement, telling the media that he was finished protesting over his pay strike and has apologised not only to the club but also to the fans, as he was wrong to walk out on the club.[citation needed]\n\nOn 7 April 2015, he was removed from training with the main Dynamo Moscow squad and transfer-listed by the team for \"interfering with the work of the head coach\" Stanislav Cherchesov.[21]\n\nIn November 2015, he was again moved to Dynamo's reserves squad by the new manager Andrey Kobelev after Denisov demanded that the club management fire the club's doctor whom Denisov called incompetent.[40]\n\nOn 16 April 2018, he was fined 1 million rubles by his club Lokomotiv Moscow for insulting a doping control official during a test.[41]\n\nDenisov and his wife Elena have four children: Viktoria, born in 2005, Igor Jr., born in 2008, and twin sons Ivan and Daniil who were born on 18 December 2011.[42] He owns two South African pitbulls and is known in Russia as being a very good chess player and for never giving interviews to reporters.[43]\n\nDenisov has publicly opposed the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by saying: \"These events are a disaster. Complete horror. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019ll be imprisoned or killed for these words, but I am speaking as it is.\"[44]\n\nNotes\n\nZenit Saint Petersburg\n\nLokomotiv Moscow\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Denisov"}, {"id": 171, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/72/1437737/original/les-ferdinand-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Les Ferdinand", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/les-ferdinand/1437737", "desc": "Leslie Ferdinand MBE (born 8 December 1966) is an English former footballer and current football coach and Director of Football at his former club Queens Park Rangers.

Probably the worst thing I have encountered in my professional career has been racist letters coming from supporters \u2013 most of which, I have to say, have come from Everton fans. After I scored that hat-trick against them over the Easter period, the letters I got back were disgusting.[20]\nFerdinand's fine form continued into 1993\u201394, during which his 16 goals from 36 games helped QPR finish ninth. Despite mounting speculation of a move to either Manchester United or Arsenal, he signed a two-year contract with QPR that summer.[21] In 1994\u201395, he scored 24 times in the Premier League and speculation grew that he would soon be on his way to a bigger club. In nearly a decade at Loftus Road, he played under four different managers \u2013 Jim Smith, Trevor Francis, Don Howe and Gerry Francis.[22]\n\nFerdinand was sold to Newcastle in 1995 for \u00a36 million, with Hayes receiving \u00a3600,000 due to a sell-on clause agreed following his move to QPR. With the money received, Hayes built a function suite and named it \"The Ferdinand Suite\" in his honour.[13] His arrival at the club came nearly three years after the Magpies had offered QPR \u00a33.3million for him during their Division One promotion season\u00a0\u2014 but the offer had been turned down.[23]\n\nThe spell on Tyneside was arguably Ferdinand's most successful club tenure. He scored 29 goals in his first season with Newcastle, and significantly contributed to the side's getting within touching distance of the Premiership title in the 1995\u201396 season.[18] Newcastle led the league by 12 points at one stage, but were overhauled by Manchester United in the final three months of the season.[24][25]\n\nIn both of his seasons on Tyneside, Ferdinand collected runners-up medals in the Premier League.[26] In the second season, they contested a four-horse race with Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool before Manchester United won the title. Midway through the 1996\u201397 season, however, came a change, as manager Kevin Keegan surprisingly departed Newcastle and was replaced by Kenny Dalglish.[27] Despite the Scot being regretful to lose such a talented striker, it quickly became apparent Ferdinand would be dispensed to free up funds for further signings.[28] In an interview with Sky Sports in 2019, Ferdinand admitted that he regretted leaving Newcastle and had hoped at the time to stay on Tyneside for the rest of his career.[28]\n\nFerdinand scored 50 goals in only 84 games at Newcastle, forming a successful strike partnership with Alan Shearer. He was very highly thought of by the Newcastle United supporters during his spell with the club and is known affectionately as 'Sir Les' on Tyneside.[26]\n\nFerdinand received a standing ovation when he returned to St James' Park as a Tottenham player, trying to put Shearer's number 9 shirt on to complete a lap of honour, he broke down in tears and could only manage to put the shirt on inside out and back to front before being helped from the field. Ferdinand returned again, when he also received a standing ovation, coming on as a substitute at Alan Shearer's testimonial and subsequently scored.\n\nHe was inducted into the Newcastle United Foundation Hall of Fame on 7 November 2017.[26]\n\nIn 1997 Ferdinand was bought by Tottenham Hotspur, the club he supported as a boy, for \u00a36 million.[18] Injuries heavily disrupted his first season at the club, but towards the end of the campaign he formed a good partnership with J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, and the pair's goals saved Spurs from relegation from the Premiership.[18] Ferdinand helped Spurs win the League Cup in 1999, defeating Leicester City 1\u20130 in the final at Wembley, but injuries restricted him to just 12 goals in his first three seasons at the club.[18][29][30]\n\nHe improved his goal-scoring return over the next two seasons, contributing 10 goals in the 2000\u201301 season and a further 15 during the 2001\u201302 campaign. Ferdinand scored the 10,000th goal in Premiership history on 15 December 2001 in a 4\u20130 win against Fulham.[31] He played in a second League Cup final for the club against Blackburn Rovers in 2002, but was thwarted by three saves by Rovers' goalkeeper Brad Friedel as Spurs lost 2\u20131.[32]\n\nAfter struggling to find a place in Spurs' first team season following Glenn Hoddle's purchase of Robbie Keane from Leeds, he moved to West Ham United on 21 January 2003 for an undisclosed fee.[33] He scored his first goal for the club against former club Tottenham,[34] but was unable to prevent the club's relegation from the Premier League and opted to remain in the top flight by signing for newly promoted Leicester City on a free transfer. While at Leicester Ferdinand scored 14 Premiership goals, despite being 37 years old. After the Foxes were relegated at the end of that season, he rejected a new contract and joined Bolton Wanderers.[35]\n\nFerdinand memorably scored for Bolton Wanderers against rivals Manchester United in the last minute, despite playing from a centre back position, which looked to have given the Wanderers the win, but a goal from David Bellion even deeper in injury time gave United a point.[36]\n\nHe found opportunities from the start limited, but proved useful for all his experience when coming off the substitutes' bench, and scored against former club Tottenham in the League Cup, with what proved to be a mere consolation goal in a 4\u20133 thriller which Bolton lost.[37] He left them on 2 January 2005. Four days later, he signed with Reading. His contract at the club lasted until the end of the 2004\u201305 season. He scored one league goal in his time at Reading, in a 2\u20131 loss to Coventry.[38]\n\nFerdinand committed to non-contract terms with Watford during the 2005\u201306, but did not play a competitive game for the club and left after their promotion to the Premier League via the Football League Championship playoffs. He retired from football a few months short of his 40th birthday.[18]\n\nFerdinand made his England debut in February 1993 against San Marino, scoring the final goal in a 6\u20130 victory at Wembley.[39] Ferdinand was capped 17 times, scoring five goals. He was part of the Euro 96 and 1998 FIFA World Cup squads.[12]\n\nOn 5 November 2008 Ferdinand joined fellow ex-Tottenham player Tim Sherwood on the coaching staff of Tottenham Hotspur, to work with the strikers.[40][41] Ferdinand left the club on 19 June 2014.[42] On 4 February 2015, Ferdinand became the director of football at Queens Park Rangers.[43]\n\nBe\u015fikta\u015f\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Ferdinand"}, {"id": 172, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/1708/34151355/original/tyler-rix-recording-artists-and-groups-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Tyler Rix", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/tyler-rix/34151355", "desc": "Tyler Rix  (b Watford, 2 January 1993) is a British singer songwriter, saxophonist & international model.

Law spent one year there before Torino bought him for \u00a3110,000, this time setting a new record fee for a transfer involving a British player. Although he played well in Italy, he found it difficult to settle there and signed for Manchester United in 1962, setting another British record transfer fee of \u00a3115,000 (equivalent to \u00a32,610,060 in 2021).\n\nLaw spent 11 years at Manchester United, where he scored 237 goals in 404 appearances. His goals tally places him third in the club's history, behind Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton. He was nicknamed The King[4] and The Lawman by supporters, and Denis the Menace by opposing supporters. He is the only Scottish player to have won the Ballon d'Or award, doing so in 1964, and helped his club win the First Division in 1965 and 1967. He missed their European Cup triumph in 1968 through injury.\n\nLaw left Manchester United in 1973 to return to Manchester City for a season, and represented Scotland at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. He played only two competitive games in the 1974\u201375 season, retiring before the start of the League programme proper.[5] Law played for Scotland a total of 55 times and jointly holds the Scottish international record goal tally with 30 goals. Law holds a United record for scoring 46 competitive goals in a single season.\n\nLaw was born in Aberdeen, Scotland,[1] to George Law, a fisherman, and his wife, Robina; he was the youngest of seven children, four boys and three girls. The Law family were not well off and lived in a council tenement flat at Printfield Terrace in Woodside, Aberdeen.[6][7] He went barefoot until he was 12 years old and wore handed-down shoes throughout his adolescence; his first pair of football boots came as a second-hand birthday present from a neighbour, which he received as a teenager.[6]\n\nHe supported Aberdeen and watched them when he had enough money to do so, watching local non-league teams when he did not.[6] His obsession with football led to him turning down a place at Aberdeen Grammar School, because he would have had to play rugby there. Instead, he attended Powis Academy in Aberdeen. Despite having a serious squint, he showed great promise once he was moved from full back to inside-left, and was selected for Scotland Schoolboys.[6]\n\nIn the 1954\u201355 season, he was spotted by Archie Beattie, a scout for Huddersfield Town, who invited 14-year-old Law to go for a trial. When he got there, the manager said, \"The boy's a freak. Never did I see a less likely football prospect \u2013 weak, puny and bespectacled.\" However, to Law's surprise, they signed him on 3 April 1955. While he was at Huddersfield, he had an operation to correct his squint, which greatly enhanced his self-confidence.[8]\n\nHuddersfield's relegation to what was then the Second Division made it easier for Law to get a game, and he made his debut on 24 December 1956, aged only sixteen, in a 2\u20131 win over Notts County.[9] Manchester United's manager Matt Busby shortly offered Huddersfield \u00a310,000 for Law, a substantial amount of money for a teenage footballer at that time, but the club turned the offer down. Bill Shankly was manager of Huddersfield between 1956 and 1959, and when he left for Liverpool he wanted to take Law with him, but Liverpool were unable to afford him at that time.[10]\n\nIn March 1960, Law signed for Manchester City for what was then a British record transfer fee, estimated to be \u00a355,000,[note 1] although Law's share of the fee was \"precisely nothing\".[11] Once again, Matt Busby had attempted to sign Law for Manchester United, but United's cross-city rivals beat them to Law's signature.[6]\n\nCity had narrowly avoided relegation from Division I the previous season, and Law genuinely felt that Huddersfield had a better team at the time.[12] He made his debut on 19 March, and scored in a 4\u20133 defeat to Leeds United. In April 1961, he scored two goals in a 4\u20131 win over Aston Villa that ensured City's survival in Division One.\n\nAlthough he had thought about leaving,[13] he was playing well and in 1961 Law scored an incredible six goals in an FA Cup tie against Luton Town. However, the match was abandoned with twenty minutes to go, so his six goals did not count. To make matters worse for him, Luton won the replay 3\u20131, and City were knocked out of the Cup.[14]\n\nAlthough he enjoyed his time at City,[15] he wanted to play in a more successful side and was sold to the Italian club Torino in the summer of 1961.\n\nLaw moved to Torino for a fee of \u00a3110,000,[note 2] (a record fee for a transfer involving a British player)[16] and was accompanied by Joe Baker who had signed from Scottish side Hibernian.[17] Law's time in Italy did not go according to plan. Another Italian club, Internazionale, tried to prevent him becoming a Torino player as soon as he arrived, claiming he had signed a pre-contract agreement with them, although they dropped this claim before the season started.[6][17]\n\nPlayers in the UK were not treated well at the time, and the maximum wage for footballers had only recently been abolished there, so he was pleasantly surprised to find that pre-season training was based in a luxury hotel in the Alps.[6] However, Torino took performance-related pay to something of an extreme, giving the players large sums of money when the team won, but little, if any, when they lost.[18] Like many British footballers who have gone to play in Italy, Law did not like the style of football and found adapting to it difficult. The ultra-defensive catenaccio system was popular there at the time, so forwards did not get many chances to score.[19]\n\nOn 7 February 1962, he was injured in a car crash when his teammate Joe Baker drove the wrong way around a roundabout and clipped the kerb as he tried to turn the car around, flipping it over. Baker was almost killed, but Law's injuries were not life-threatening.[20]\n\nBy April, he had put in a transfer request, which was ignored.[17] The final straw for Law came in a match against Napoli when he was sent off. After the match, he was told that Torino's coach, Beniamino Santos, had instructed the referee to send him off because he was angry at Law for taking a throw in, which he had been told not to do.[21] Law walked out, and was told that he would be transferred to Manchester United. A few days later, however, he was told that he was being sold to Juventus and that the small print in his contract committed him to going there whether he wanted to or not. He responded by flying home to Aberdeen, knowing that Torino would not get a penny in transfer fees if he refused to play at Juventus.[6] He eventually signed for United on 10 July 1962, for a new British record fee of \u00a3115,000.[note 3][6][22]\n\nAlthough his time in Italy was mixed, Law was voted number one foreign player in Italy ahead of teammate Joe Baker, Fiorentina winger Kurt Hamrin and Inter Milan midfielder Luis Suarez.[17] The lifestyle and culture of a foreign country was an eye-opener for the young Scotsman, and the medical expertise and sports science in Italy was far ahead of what was available in the UK at the time.[17] Ultimately though, Law found the football to be joyless and overly defensive, with him being subjected to violent man marking and heavy tackling on a frequent basis.[17]\n\nLaw moved back to Manchester, boarding with the same landlady with whom he had lived during his time as a City player. His first match for United was against West Bromwich Albion on 18 August 1962, and he made an excellent start, scoring after only seven minutes. The match finished in a 2\u20132 draw. However, United's form had been erratic since the Munich air disaster in 1958, and because of their inconsistency they spent the season fighting relegation. In a league match against Leicester City Law scored a hat trick but United still lost. They found form in the FA Cup though, with Law scoring another hat trick in a 5\u20130 win against his old club Huddersfield Town, and they went on to reach the final against Leicester City. Leicester were strong favourites, having finished fourth in the league, but Law scored the first goal as United won 3\u20131 in what turned out to be the only FA Cup final of his career.[23] He also married his wife Diana that season, on 11 December 1962.\n\nAn incident took place that season that Law felt had repercussions in later years. In a match against West Brom on 15 December 1962, the referee Gilbert Pullin consistently goaded Law with taunts such as \"Oh, you clever so and so, you can't play\", and after the match, Law and his manager Matt Busby reported the matter to the Football Association.[24] A disciplinary committee decided that Pullin should be severely censured, but he did not accept their verdict and quit the game. Law later claimed that \"in the eyes of some referees, I was a marked man\" and blamed the incident for the \"staggeringly heavy punishments\" that he received later in his career.[25]\n\nLaw scored a number of goals early in the 1963\u201364 season and was selected to play for a Rest of the World side against England at Wembley, scoring their goal in a 2\u20131 defeat.[26] He later described this as the greatest honour of his career.[27] His season was interrupted by a 28-day suspension for a sending off that he received against Aston Villa. The unusually cold winter forced United to play many of their fixtures in a short time, and their results suffered. Law later blamed this for United's failure to win a trophy in that season. Despite the lack of silverware, Law enjoyed a prolific goalscoring season and finished the campaign with 46 goals in all competitions, still a club record today.[28]\n\nIn 1964\u201365, Law won the Ballon d'Or award,[29] and Manchester United won their first league title since Munich.[30] Law's 28 league goals that season made him the First Division's top scorer.\n\nThe following season, Law injured his right knee while playing for Scotland against Poland on 21 October 1965. He had previously had an operation on the same knee while at Huddersfield,[31] and the injury was to trouble him for the rest of his career.\n\nIn 1966, Law asked United's manager Matt Busby to give him a pay rise at his next contract renewal, and threatened to leave the club if he did not get one. Busby immediately placed Law on the transfer list, announcing that \"no player will hold this club to ransom, no player\". When Law went to see him, Busby pulled out a written apology for him to sign, showing it to the press once he had done so.[32] Law later claimed that Busby had used the incident to warn other players not to do the same thing, but had secretly given him the pay rise.[33] Despite all this, Law scored 23 goals in 36 league appearances during 1966\u201367, helping United win the league title again.[30][34]\n\nIn 1968, United won the European Cup for the first time, but Law's knee injury was causing him serious problems and he missed both the semi-final second leg and the final as a result. He was regularly given cortisone injections to ease the pain, but playing while the knee was still injured was causing long-term damage. He visited a specialist in January 1968 who wrote to United claiming that a previous operation to remove the cartilage from the knee had failed and recommending that a second operation be performed, but Law was not shown the report for several years and had to continue full training.[35]\n\nIn 1968\u201369, United reached the semi-final of the European Cup, playing AC Milan. United lost the first leg in the San Siro 2\u20130, winning the second leg at Old Trafford 1\u20130 with a Bobby Charlton goal. Having scored seven times in the 10\u20132 aggregate first round victory over Waterford United, Law finished as top scorer in the tournament with 9 goals.\n\nWilf McGuinness took over as first team coach at the start of the 1969\u201370 season.[36] United finished eighth in the league, but Law missed almost all of the season through injury, and in April 1970 he was transfer listed for \u00a360,000. Nobody made a bid for him, so he stayed at United.[37]\n\nAfter a poor 1970\u201371 season, United appointed Frank O'Farrell as manager. They made a good start to the 1971\u201372 season and finished 1971 five points clear at the top of the league, with Law having scored twelve goals. However, results deteriorated and they finished the season in eighth place.[38] Law scored in the first match of the following season, 1972\u201373, but his knee injury was troubling him again, and he failed to score for the rest of the season. The poor results continued and O'Farrell was sacked.\n\nLaw recommended that United replace O'Farrell with Tommy Docherty, whom he knew from his time playing with the Scottish national side.[37][39] The club followed his recommendation, and things started well, with the team's improved results lifting them into mid-table.[37] Law was given a free transfer by Tommy Docherty in the summer of 1973,[37] after 11 years at the club during which he had scored a total of 237 goals in 404 games in all competitions, as well as collecting two league title medals and an FA Cup winner's medal. Only Bobby Charlton (who retired in 1973) and Wayne Rooney have scored more goals for United.[40][41]\n\nLaw was offered a contract by Manchester City manager Johnny Hart. He scored two goals on his second debut for City, against Birmingham City in the opening game of the 1973\u201374 season.[42] He made 27 full appearances and two as substitute in that season, including City's 2\u20131 defeat in the League Cup final against Wolves.[43] In City's last game of the 1973\u201374 season against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Law's 81st-minute back-heeled goal gave City a 1\u20130 lead but, thinking his goal might relegate United, Law did not celebrate the goal. Results of the day's other matches meant that United were relegated whatever their result, but Law did not know that at the time. A number of pitch invasions by United fans followed, and Law walked off the pitch with his head down as he was substituted. The pitch invasions forced the referee to abandon the game in the 85th minute. After a review, the Football League decided that the result should stand.[37]\n\nLaw had a contract with Manchester City for the 1974\u201375 season, but new manager Tony Book told him that he would only be playing reserve team football if he stayed at the club. He did not want to end his career in this way, so he retired from professional football in the summer of 1974.[44] Law played two games for Manchester City in the season 1974\u201375, in the pre-season Texaco Cup tournament, scoring the last goal of his career in the game against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane on 6 August 1974. His last professional game was the 2\u20131 victory against Oldham Athletic at Maine Road on 10 August 1974.[45] He formally retired on 26 August 1974.[46]\n\nLaw was not chosen to play for Scotland in the 1958 FIFA World Cup, but was given his debut in a British Home Championship match against Wales on 18 October 1958 by Matt Busby, who managed Scotland on a temporary basis for two matches. Law scored Scotland's second goal in a 3\u20130 win over the Welsh at Ninian Park.[47][48][49] He played but did not score in Scotland's match against England on 15 April 1961. Scotland lost the match 9\u20133, and Law described it as his \"blackest day\".[50] While with Torino, Law continued to play for Scotland, although the club were not keen to release him for international matches and had put a clause into his contract stating that they were not obliged to do so.\n\nLaw was chosen for the Rest of the World team that faced England in the FA Centenary match in 1963.[26]\n\nLaw injured his right knee while playing for Scotland against Poland on 21 October 1965. Law scored in Scotland's famous 3\u20132 victory over England on 15 April 1967 in the 1967 British Home Championship, less than a year after England had become world champions. Manchester United won the league that season, but Law felt that the victory over England was even more satisfying.[51]\n\nScotland reached the World Cup finals in the summer of 1974, for the first time since 1958. Although he had not played much first team football in the preceding season, Law was included in the squad and played in their first match, against Zaire. He did not score, but Scotland won 2\u20130. Law was \"very disappointed\" not to be picked for the following match against Brazil,[52] and was not selected for the following match against Yugoslavia either. Although Scotland were not defeated in any of their matches, they did not qualify for the second phase and were out of the World Cup.[53] The match against Zaire proved to be the last of Law's 55 appearances for Scotland.\n\nLaw jointly holds the Scottish international record goal tally with 30 goals.[54][note 4]\n\nHe first met his wife-to-be, Diana, in an Aberdeenshire dancehall when they were both still teenagers.[55] They married in December 1962 and went on to have five children.[56] Their daughter, also called Diana, worked for several years in the Manchester United press office.[57][58] Their other children are Gary, Andrew, Robert and Iain. Denis Law and his wife still live in the Manchester area.[citation needed]\n\nSince retiring as a player, Law has often worked on radio and television summarising and presenting games. He was one of the first sport news presenters of Granada Reports and was the sub-presenter of Granada Television's Kick Off Match, the equivalent of LWT's The Big Match. He appeared as a special guest on the TV guest show This Is Your Life on 19 February 1975, months after retiring as a player.[59]\n\nHe was made an Inaugural Inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game. On 23 February 2002, a statue of Law (alongside George Best and Bobby Charlton) was unveiled at Old Trafford, in the part of the stadium known as the Scoreboard End.[60] He had a successful operation to treat prostate cancer in November 2003[61] and was awarded honorary degrees from the Universities of Aberdeen and St. Andrews in 2005,[62] and Robert Gordon University in 2017.[63]\n\nThe emergence of Dutch international Dennis Bergkamp in the 1990s uncovered a story that the player's parents were fans of Law and named their son after him.[64] However, Dutch authorities refused to recognise the name unless it was spelt with two n's as they felt it was otherwise too similar to the female name Denise.[65]\n\nOn 25 November 2005, Law was at the bedside of former United teammate George Best as he died of multiple organ failure.[66]\n\nIn May 2008, at the City of Manchester Stadium, he (with UEFA president Michel Platini) presented the medals to the winners of the UEFA Cup, Zenit Saint Petersburg and their opponents, Scottish side Rangers.\n\nIn February 2010, Law was named as patron of the UK based charity Football Aid, taking over from the late Sir Bobby Robson.[67]\n\nIn 2012 he established the Denis Law Legacy Trust, a registered charity that operates programmes and activities focussed around community engagement and widening sporting participation.[68] The charity aims to reduce instances of youth crime and anti-social behaviour; promote health and wellbeing and encourage inclusivity through sport, physical activity and creative endeavour [69] collaborating on community projects like Scotland's first Cruyff Court in Aberdeen.[70]\n\nIn 2012, a statue to Law, commissioned by the Denis Law Legacy Trust, was unveiled at the entrance to Aberdeen Sports Village (a facility he had formally opened two years earlier) depicting his pose after scoring for Scotland against England in 1967.[71][72]\n\nLaw was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to football and charity.[73] In 2017, he received the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen.[74][75]\n\nIn August 2021, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.[76][77]\n\nIn November 2021 a second statue of Law was unveiled in Aberdeen city centre.[78]\n\nManchester United\n\nScotland national team\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Law"}, {"id": 175, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/72/1427905/original/lee-chapman-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Lee Chapman", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/lee-chapman/1427905", "desc": "Lee Roy Chapman (born 5 December 1959) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker from 1978 until 1996, in which he scored almost 200 first-team goals.He is best known for spells with Stoke City, Leeds United, Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest and West Ham United.

He also played for Plymouth Argyle, Arsenal, Sunderland, Portsmouth, Southend United, Ipswich Town and Swansea City. As well as this he played in both France and Norway for Chamois Niortais and Str\u00f8msgodset IF, and was capped by both the England U21 and England B teams. He also won the Football League Cup with Nottingham Forest and the league title with Leeds United. He scored a total of more than 250 goals in all competitions during a club career which lasted for nearly 20 years.\n\nChapman was born in Lincoln and began his career at Stoke City.[1] He made his league debut whilst on loan at Plymouth Argyle in 1978\u201379.[1] He made his debut for Stoke in a League Cup match against Swindon Town with Chapman scoring Stoke's goal in a 2\u20131 defeat.[1] He soon became a vital player for Stoke top-scoring in both 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382 which prompted Arsenal to pay Stoke \u00a3500,000 for his services.[1]\n\nHowever, the move was not a success \u2013 he made only 23 appearances for the club and scored four goals. Chapman moved to Sunderland in December 1983, but again failed to establish himself in the team, scoring just 3 goals in 15 appearances. Howard Wilkinson, then manager of Sheffield Wednesday, signed Chapman in August 1984, and at Wednesday he regained his goal scoring form; between 1984 and 1988 Chapman scored 63 goals in 149 appearances. However, Wilkinson moved on to manage Leeds United in 1988, and on his departure Chapman moved on briefly to French side Chamois Niortais.\n\nIn October 1988, Brian Clough signed Chapman for Nottingham Forest.[2] Chapman was an integral part of the Forest team that won the League Cup and Full Members Cup in 1989, scoring two goals in the latter's final.[2] Chapman had a positive season in the league as Forest finished third, though they never looked likely to catch the leading pair of Arsenal (champions on goals scored) and runners-up Liverpool. However, Forest's failure to clinch the title in 1988\u201389 was not ultimately the end of Chapman's quest to be part of a title winning side.\n\nIn his time at the City Ground, Chapman was one of the Forest players who had to cope with the horrors of the Hillsborough disaster during the opening minutes of their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool.[3] Chapman played in the rescheduled game at Old Trafford, which Liverpool won 3\u20131. In January 1990, Howard Wilkinson paid Nottingham Forest \u00a3400,000 to recruit Chapman to Leeds United. Chapman was part of the Leeds team that won the Second Division title and promotion to the First Division in 1990. Leeds finished 4th in 1991, and 21-goal Chapman was one of the highest scorers in the league. He scored a hat-trick in a remarkable league match at Elland Road against Liverpool on 13 April 1991, though Leeds lost the game 5\u20134. This was the first time in a decade that a Leeds player had scored a top flight hat-trick (Leeds had been out of the First Division from 1982 until 1990).[4]\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, Chapman scored 16 goals[5] as Leeds won the last league title before the creation of the FA Premier League.[6] His 16 goals in the club's title winning season included two league hat-tricks; the first in a 6\u20131 away win against his old club Sheffield Wednesday on 12 January 1992, the second on 14 March 1992 in a 5\u20131 home win over Wimbledon.[4] Chapman scored the club's first two goals in the new league at the start of the 1992\u201393 season, scoring twice in a 2\u20131 home win over Wimbledon.[7] Despite being the top scorer for Leeds in the 1992\u201393 season with 14 goals, Chapman was allowed to move to Portsmouth at the age of 33 for \u00a3250,000 on 11 August 1993.[8]\n\nChapman made a Premier League comeback just four months after moving to Portsmouth when West Ham United signed him for \u00a3250,000 in September 1993. Making his West Ham debut along with other new signings Mike Marsh and David Burrows, Chapman scored in a 2\u20130 away win against Blackburn Rovers on 18 September 1993.[9] He played 51 games in all competitions scoring 11 goals.[10] He remained in the Premier League when he moved on to Ipswich for a fee of \u00a370,000 in November 1994.[10] He played one game on loan for Southend United in January 1995, scoring the consolation goal in the Shrimpers' 4\u20131 defeat at Grimsby Town.\n\nDuring early 1996 he was loaned back to Leeds United where he played only two games. In his first, against one of his former sides, West Ham United, he was sent-off for elbowing defender Marc Rieper.[11] He finished his UK career with Swansea. During the summer of 1996 he had a brief spell in Norway with Str\u00f8msgodset scoring one goal.\n\nChapman was capped by both the England U21 and England B teams.\n\nHe is the son of former Lincoln City, Port Vale and Chester striker Roy Chapman. Chapman is married to the actress Leslie Ash, with whom he owns two restaurants: So:uk in London and Teatro Leeds (in which one of his former clubs, Leeds United, is a shareholder).[12] He previously owned another Teatro restaurant in London's Soho.[13]\n\nIn 2011 Chapman and his wife, Leslie Ash, indicated that they were preparing to sue the News of the World for breach of privacy over suspicions that their voicemails, and those of their children, were illegally accessed by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.[14] After writing to the police over their suspicions, the police informed them that there were four pieces of paper referring to Ash in Mulcaire's notebooks, and five items relating to Chapman. There were further items relating to their children.[14]\n\nSource:[15]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Chapman"}, {"id": 176, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/79/1572983/original/michael-carrick-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Michael Carrick", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/michael-carrick/1572983", "desc": "Michael Carrick (born 28 July 1981) is an English football coach and former player.

His playing style was grounded in his passing ability.[4][5]\n\nCarrick began his career at West Ham United, joining the youth team in 1997 and winning the FA Youth Cup two years later. He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to Swindon Town and Birmingham City, before securing a place in the first team by the 2000\u201301 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002\u201303 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for the Hammers, and in 2004, he moved to rival London club Tottenham Hotspur for a fee believed to be \u00a33.5\u00a0million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for \u00a314\u00a0million.\n\nFrom his debut onwards, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in 2006\u201307, their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the 2008 Champions League final, playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the European Double. As of 2023, he is the only English player alongside former teammate Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup.[6][7] In winning the 2016 FA Cup, Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.[8]\n\nCarrick has represented England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 and went on to gain 34 caps without scoring a goal. Carrick was often overlooked during his England career, with many of his contemporaries being preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012\u201313 season, when Carrick established himself as a regular. He was a member of the England squad for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.\n\nCarrick was born to Vince and Lynn Carrick in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear,[2][9] and first became involved in football at age four.[10] A boyhood fan of Newcastle United,[11] he played five-a-side football with Wallsend Boys Club on Saturday nights, courtesy of his father's volunteer work at the club. Aged nine, he had a trials with Middlesbrough, Stoke City, Arsenal, Crystal Palace and Chelsea.[10] Football became more serious for him at the age of 12 when he was selected for Burnside High School and later on North Tyneside Schools. While playing for Wallsend Boys' Club under-16s, he was capped for the England Boys' club side. At age 13, Carrick was profiled by the BBC children's programme Live & Kicking episode 49, which aired on 4 February 1995.[12] During his school years, and the years up until his move to West Ham United, Carrick actually played as a centre-forward; it was only at West Ham that he started to play more often as a midfielder. He studied at Wallsend's Western Middle School and Burnside Community High School, completing his GCSE exams in 1997.\n\nCarrick was part of the West Ham United youth squad that won the FA Youth Cup in the 1998\u201399 season.[13] He scored twice in their two-legged 9\u20130 record final victory over Coventry City.[14]\nAccording to his manager at the time, Harry Redknapp, Carrick's difficulty at the start of his career was mainly physical and he lost almost two seasons to injuries because of his rapid growth.[15] He made his debut for West Ham in a 1\u20131 away draw with Jokerit in the UEFA Intertoto Cup on 24 July 1999.[16] His league debut came five weeks later on 28 August, when he replaced Rio Ferdinand in a 3\u20130 victory over Bradford City at Valley Parade.[17] In November 1999, Carrick was sent on a one-month loan to Swindon Town and made his first appearance for them in a 0\u20130 draw at home with Norwich City.[18] He scored his first ever professional career goal in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Charlton Athletic on 23 November.[19] He scored once more during his loan spell, netting in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Walsall on 4 December.[20] Although he impressed during his spell he could not help the team find a much-needed win during his 6 outings,[21] playing his final game for them in a 3\u20130 defeat at Manchester City on 18 December.[22] In February 2000, he was sent on loan again, this time to Birmingham City, making just two appearances for the Blues.[17] Carrick returned to Upton Park and scored his first goal for West Ham United, scoring the first in a 5\u20130 home win over Coventry City on 22 April.[23] During his first season he was voted as West Ham United's Young Player of the Year.[24]\n\n\"It is frustrating for me when I see the quality of players who have left the club in the last six or seven months. I knew players were going to leave when we suffered relegation, but it's weird for me now because the whole club seems to be different.\"\n\n\u2013 Carrick on his frustration with many West Ham stars leaving the club following their relegation from the Premier League in 2003[25]\n\nCarrick made his West Ham breakthrough in the 2000\u201301 season,[26] playing 41 games in all competitions, which included 33 games in the league.[27] His only goal of the season came in a 1\u20131 home draw against Aston Villa on 9 December 2000.[28] Carrick was awarded a new, improved contract for his progress that would keep him at Upton Park until 2005.[29] On 20 April 2001, he was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year alongside teammate Joe Cole.[30] The award was eventually won by Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard on 29 April.[31] For the second successive season Carrick was voted as West Ham's Young Player of the Year.[32] The 2001\u201302 season saw Carrick make 32 appearances for the Hammers.[33] Carrick scored twice during this season, his first was West Ham's only goal in a 7\u20131 loss at Blackburn Rovers on 14 October.[34] He scored the first goal in a 2\u20131 victory over rivals Chelsea ten days later.[35] Towards the end of the season, Carrick suffered a recurrence of a groin injury that ruled him out of the 2002 FIFA World Cup for the England squad.[36]\n\nThe 2002\u201303 season was one to forget for Carrick, as West Ham were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the campaign,[37] with Carrick playing his last game of the season in a 2\u20130 victory over Sunderland on 22 March 2003.[38] Rather than leave the club like teammates Joe Cole, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 and Jermain Defoe, Carrick stayed with West Ham during their first season back in the First Division.[39] During the 2003\u201304 season, West Ham finished fourth on the final day to ensure a place in the play-offs.[40] However, they lost 1\u20130 in the final to Crystal Palace and were denied a return to the top flight.[41] Carrick was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division.[42]\n\nAfter one season outside the Premier League, Carrick felt compelled to leave the First Division, saying: \"the truth is I didn't feel I could play First Division football much longer.\"[15] He was linked with moves to a number of teams including Portsmouth, Arsenal, Everton, West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace before Tottenham Hotspur emerged as front-runners to sign him.[43] On 20 August, a deal was agreed between West Ham and Tottenham for the transfer of Carrick subject to a medical.[44] Four days later, the transfer was official as Carrick joined the club for around \u00a33.5\u00a0million after the passing of a medical.[45] He made a goalscoring appearance for the Tottenham reserves, but his first team debut for the club was delayed after suffering an injury setback on 13 September.[46] Carrick was assigned the number 23 shirt and made his Tottenham debut on 18 October as a substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat at Portsmouth.[47]\n\nDespite being fit he was often overlooked by then-manager Jacques Santini. It was unclear as to whether Santini really wanted him at all as there was much media speculation that Carrick was bought by Tottenham's Director of Football Frank Arnesen rather than Santini.[48][49] However, following the departure of Santini and the appointment of new manager Martin Jol he soon emerged as a regular starter in midfield.[50] His first full start for Tottenham was also Jol's first game in charge of the club away to Burnley in the League Cup on 9 November. During the game he assisted a goal for Robbie Keane as they went on to win 3\u20130.[51] On 18 December, he produced a display that was influential in helping Tottenham to a 5\u20131 win at home over Southampton.[52][53] Carrick subsequently ended the 2004\u201305 season with 29 league appearances but failed to score as they finished the table in 9th and missed out on a UEFA Cup spot.[54][55]\n\nOn 3 December 2005, Carrick scored his first Tottenham goal as he netted the winner in a 3\u20132 home win over Sunderland.[56] He scored his second goal for the club on 8 April 2006 in a 2\u20131 win at home over Manchester City.[57] On 22 April, Carrick was lauded for his performance, which helped Tottenham to a 1\u20131 away draw in the North London derby against Arsenal.[58][59] On 7 May, Carrick was one of 10 Tottenham players who fell ill at a hotel just before their final game of the season away to West Ham as the players suffered from apparent food poisoning.[60] He managed to play in the game but lasted just 63 minutes in the 2\u20131 defeat to his former club. As a result of the loss rivals Arsenal beat them to fourth place in the league and the spot for the Champions League.[61][62] He made more crosses and more passes than any other Tottenham player during the 2005\u201306 season, and along with Mido was joint top in assists.[63]\n\nOn 10 June, Tottenham revealed they had rejected a bid from Manchester United for Carrick, who was seen by their manager Sir Alex Ferguson as a replacement for the departed Roy Keane, the former club captain.[64] The following day, Tottenham manager Martin Jol insisted Carrick would be staying with the club, stating \"I don't want to lose a player like Michael, who was probably our best midfielder last season\".[65] On 28 July, Tottenham announced that the clubs agreed a deal for the transfer of Carrick to Manchester United.[66] Three days later, the transfer was official as personal terms were agreed with Carrick.[67] Despite agreeing a deal for the player the previous week \u2013 the fee was not made public until Spurs issued a statement to the stock exchange.[68] Manchester United's chief executive David Gill confirmed the transfer fee as \u00a314\u00a0million, potentially rising to \u00a318.6\u00a0million, which would make Carrick the sixth most expensive player acquired by Manchester United at the time.[69] He was given the number 16 shirt, previously worn by Keane.[70]\n\nCarrick made his debut for the club on 4 August 2006 in a 3\u20131 pre-season friendly win over Porto in the Amsterdam Tournament.[71] The following day, Carrick was forced to miss the start of the 2006\u201307 season as a result of injuring his foot during the final tournament match against Ajax.[72] Following his recovery from this injury he made his competitive debut on 23 August in a 3\u20130 away league win over Charlton Athletic.[73] Three days later, he made his first start for the club in a 2\u20131 win away over Watford.[74] Towards the end of December he missed two games as he suffered a minor injury.[75] He returned in time to feature in United's final game of 2006, a 3\u20132 home win over Reading on 30 December.[76] On 13 January 2007, Carrick scored his first Manchester United goal in a 3\u20131 win at home over Aston Villa.[77] One month later, he scored his first ever FA Cup goal in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Reading on 17 February.[78] He followed this up by contributing one of United's goals in a 4\u20131 home win over Blackburn Rovers on 31 March.[79] Carrick scored his first-ever Champions League goals on 10 April, scoring twice in a 7\u20131 home win over Roma in their quarter-final second leg tie.[80] They would go on to lose their semi-final tie 5\u20133 on aggregate to eventual champions A.C. Milan ending their hopes of an all English final with Liverpool.[81] He scored his final goal of the season in a 2\u20130 win at home over Sheffield United on 17 April.[82] His first season with Manchester United ended in success, as they won the Premier League title as a result of Chelsea's 1\u20131 draw with Arsenal on 6 May.[83]\n\nCarrick suffered an injury setback in October 2007 after breaking his elbow in a 1\u20130 home win over Roma in the Champions League group stage.[84] As a result of the injury he would be out of action for up to six weeks.[85] His return to action came on 3 November as a substitute for Anderson in a 2\u20132 draw at Arsenal.[86] Carrick scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 2008 in the Manchester derby, his goal came in injury time and was mere consolation in a 2\u20131 home loss to rivals Manchester City.[87] His second and final goal of the season came against his former club West Ham United in a 4\u20131 win at home on 3 May.[88] Although he scored just two league goals that season it still led to another league title as United beat Wigan Athletic on the final day of the season to prevent Chelsea from reaching the top spot.[89] On 18 April, one week on from their title success Carrick was offered a new five-year contract along with defenders Rio Ferdinand and Wes Brown.[90] A four-year contract was then signed on 17 May 2008, which tied Carrick to United until at least June 2012.[91] He participated in his first-ever Champions League final on 21 May in Moscow, playing the full 120 minutes in a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win over Chelsea in the 2008 final.[92] The scoreline ended 1\u20131 after extra time, he took United's second penalty of the subsequent shootout, which he converted to help give him the first European honour of his career.[93]\n\nDuring United's first league game of the 2008\u201309 season at home to Newcastle United, Carrick was substituted after just 25 minutes as a result of an injured ankle in the 1\u20131 draw.[94] The following day, it was confirmed he would be out for up to three weeks, which ruled him out of the UEFA Super Cup match against Zenit St. Petersburg on 29 August.[95] His return to action came on 13 September in a 2\u20131 away loss to Liverpool, he was taken off at half-time during after sustaining another injury.[96] Three days later, it was revealed he would be out for up to six weeks after breaking a bone in his foot during a challenge with Yossi Benayoun.[97] On 1 November, Carrick scored his first goal of the season in a 4\u20133 home win over Hull City.[98] His second goal followed two weeks later in a 5\u20130 home win over Stoke City.[99] His first goal of 2009 came on 22 April as he scored late on in a 2\u20130 home win over Portsmouth.[100] On 13 May, he assisted Carlos Tevez and then scored a late winner in a 2\u20131 win away to Wigan. The goal was Carrick's first for United away from home and meant that they only needed one point from their final two games to gain a third successive Premier League title.[101][102] Carrick ensured a third title in three years with United as they drew with Arsenal 0\u20130 at home on 18 May to claim an 18th overall English title.[103] On 27 May, Carrick played the full match in the 2009 Champions League Final in a 2\u20130 defeat by Barcelona.[104] This defeat was described by Carrick as worst night of his career as he said \"the game just seemed to pass us by and we were unable to do anything about it. I suppose when you look at the big picture, it was still another Champions League final\".[105]\n\nOn 30 September, Carrick scored his first goal of the 2009\u201310 season with the decisive goal against German champions Wolfsburg in a 2\u20131 Champions League win at home.[106] Two months later, he scored his first league goal of the season, scoring the second of a 3\u20130 home win over Everton.[107] Due to a defensive crisis during December, Carrick had to fill in at centre-back since Gary Neville, himself being played out of position, picked up an injury against West Ham United in a 4\u20130 away win.[108] Carrick had never previously played in defence during his career but manager Sir Alex Ferguson was very pleased with his contribution.[109] On 8 December, he played in defence again by playing in a three-man defence alongside central-midfielder Darren Fletcher and regular left-back Patrice Evra in a 3\u20131 away win against Wolfsburg in the Champions League.[110] His third goal of the season came on 30 December in a 5\u20130 home league win over Wigan Athletic in what was United's last game of the decade.[111]\n\nOn 25 January 2010, Carrick scored the first-ever League Cup goal of his career in a 4\u20133 aggregate win over rivals Manchester City in the second leg of their semi-final tie.[112] On 6 February, Carrick scored in a 5\u20130 home win over Portsmouth but it was credited as a Richard Hughes own goal following the game.[113] However, the Dubious Goals Panel officially awarded Carrick the goal on 25 May following a review.[114][115] On 16 February 2010, he was sent off for the first time in his career after seeing two yellow cards in United's 3\u20132 win over A.C. Milan at the San Siro.[116] The midfielder was shown a second yellow card in injury-time after flicking the ball away following Patrice Evra's foul on Alexandre Pato.[117] Carrick played the entire game of the 2010 League Cup Final against Aston Villa, which United won 2\u20131 resulting in his first League Cup medal.[118] This was the first season of his United career that would end without winning the league title as Chelsea claimed the crown by a single point on the final day of the season.[119]\n\nOn 6 August 2010, it was announced that Carrick would miss the start of the 2010\u201311 season as a result of an ankle injury sustained in United's final pre-season game against a League of Ireland XI.[120] However, two days later, he played 79 minutes of United's 3\u20131 victory over Chelsea in the 2010 Community Shield.[121] Manager Sir Alex Ferguson claimed, \"He came in yesterday, says he was fit, wanted to train, trained, and wanted to play.\"[122] On 3 March 2011, he signed a new three-year deal keeping him at the club until the end of the 2013\u201314 season.[123] Carrick's first significant display of the season came in a 1\u20130 away win over Chelsea in the Champions League on 6 April.[124] He played a vital pass in the move that led to Wayne Rooney's goal and was praised for his performance.[125][126] However a few days later in the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City Carrick gave the ball away which led to the only goal of the game scored by Yaya Tour\u00e9.[127]\n\nAt the start of the 2011\u201312 season, Carrick for the second season in a row was a shock starter at Wembley for the 2011 FA Community Shield. After initially being ruled out through injury by Alex Ferguson in the pre-match build-up, Carrick was named in the starting 11 for the game on 7 August 2011. In the first half, United fell behind to a Joleon Lescott header and a long range Edin D\u017eeko strike to trail 2\u20130 at half time. Carrick was then substituted at the interval and replaced by youngster Tom Cleverley. However United went on to turn the game around and prevail 3\u20132 winners.[128] The day after the Shield match, Carrick pulled out of England's friendly match against the Netherlands to rest a niggling injury. He was replaced in the squad by Tom Cleverley.[129] On 18 December, Carrick scored his first goal for United for 70 games when he advanced from his own half of the pitch after cutting out Joey Barton's square ball, past a couple of defenders and firing low past the keeper. He eventually won the Man of the Match award. On 4 January 2012, Carrick played his 250th match for Manchester United in all competitions in a 3\u20130 away defeat to Newcastle United.[130] He celebrated his Jubilee in a 3\u20132 away victory against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup third round. On 14 January 2012, Carrick scored for United in a 3\u20130 home win against Bolton. In the 83rd minute, Carrick notched his first goal at Old Trafford since January 2010. He curled a left-footed effort past \u00c1d\u00e1m Bogd\u00e1n into the bottom corner.[131] On 16 February 2012, in a Europa League 2\u20130 away win against Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena, Carrick played his 500th match in all competitions. Carrick also showed his class when he thundered a shot from 30 yards against the post in a 2\u20130 win against QPR on 8 April.[132]\n\nAs a result of a defensive injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012\u201313 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him to a corner kick to score the only goal of the game.[133] He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham.[134] He scored his first goal of the season in a 1\u20130 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3\u20131, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.[135][136] April 2013 saw Carrick nominated for the PFA Player of the Year Award for his performances during the season with Manchester United.[137] Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said Carrick would be his personal choice for the award, \"He is a quality passer. He could play for Barcelona, he would be perfectly suited to their game. He has a good vision and is an intelligent player.\"[138] Tottenham winger Gareth Bale was ultimately voted as the winner;[139] Carrick was, however, included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2012\u201313 season.[140] Carrick went on to be announced as Manchester United's Players' Player of the Year for the 2012\u201313 season.[141]\n\nOn 22 November 2013, Manchester United announced that Carrick had signed a contract extension until 2015, with the option to extend for a further year.[142][143] In the 2013\u201314 season, Carrick struggled to retain his previous season's form, as Manchester United struggled generally under new manager David Moyes.[144] His season was not helped by a persistent achilles problem that kept him out from November until December,[145] whilst new signings in midfield such as Marouane Fellaini had failed to perform.[146]\n\nIn February 2014, Carrick was criticized by former club captain Roy Keane for what Keane thought was a poor interview.[147] Although he made a total of 42 appearances in all competitions that season,[148] there was speculation over whether Carrick had a future at Manchester United.[149][150] In July, Carrick suffered an injury during a pre-season training session that was expected to keep him out for 12 weeks.[144] Carrick's first game back from injury came at the 1\u20130 defeat against Manchester City on 2 November 2014, where he came on as a replacement centre-back following Chris Smalling's dismissal.[151] After Marcos Rojo suffered a dislocated shoulder in the same match, Carrick stated that he would be happy to play as a makeshift centre-back.[152] After Carrick returned to the starting line-up on a regular basis, Match of the Day 2 pundit Dietmar Hamann attributed some of Manchester United's improved form to Carrick's return in December, after the club had won all of the six games that he had started.[153]\n\nAlex Ferguson stated that he thought Carrick was the best English player in an interview with BT Sport in December 2014, shortly after Carrick had been named as Manchester United's new vice-captain by Louis van Gaal.[154] On 15 March 2015, he provided an assist for Marouane Fellaini's goal, and scored his first goal in more than a year during a 3\u20130 victory against his former club Tottenham Hotspur.[155] Five days later, Carrick signed a new one-year extension to his contract, lengthening his Manchester United career to 10 seasons.[156] Carrick made his 400th Manchester United appearance on 2 January 2016 in the 2\u20131 home win over Swansea City, coming on as a stoppage-time substitute.[130][157] On 21 May, he played the full 120 minutes in United's FA Cup win as United beat Crystal Palace 2\u20131 after extra time.[158] This victory completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.[159] He signed a new one-year contract extension on 9 June 2016.[160]\n\nCarrick scored his first goal of the 2016\u201317 season on 21 September with United's first in a 3\u20131 away victory over Northampton Town in the third round of the EFL Cup.[161] Carrick became a key member of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's team and his performances were highly recognised for his ability to control play, instil calmness and pass accurately. Mourinho also claimed that he wished Carrick was 10 years younger.[citation needed] In May 2017, Carrick extended his contract until June 2018.[162] Eleven years of service to the club resulted in Carrick being granted a testimonial at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. Played at Old Trafford on 4 June 2017, the match was contested by a team representing Manchester United's 2008 Champions League-winning side and a team of all-stars selected by Carrick himself, managed by Sir Alex Ferguson and Harry Redknapp respectively. The match ended in a 2\u20132 draw with Carrick scoring from a 25-yard strike. The money raised from the game was distributed to Carrick's chosen charities.[163][164] Following the departure of club captain Wayne Rooney from Manchester United in July 2017, Carrick was appointed as Rooney's replacement.[165]\n\nIn November 2017, Carrick announced that he had undergone a procedure for an irregular heart rhythm after suffering dizziness during a match and in training. The medical treatment was successful and he returned to United's first-team squad as club captain.[166] In January 2018, Carrick accepted an offer to join the club's first-team coaching staff after his retirement at the end of the 2017\u201318 season.[167] He made his 464th and final appearance as a player for Manchester United in the last match of the league season against Watford at Old Trafford on 13 May, in which he helped create Marcus Rashford's game-winning goal as his side won 1\u20130.[168] Carrick was substituted towards the end of the match to allow the fans to give him a standing ovation.[169]\n\nCarrick was capped by the England national under-18 and under-21 teams before receiving his first call-up to the senior team in Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's first game in charge of England in February 2001.[58][170] Despite being named in the 31-man squad to face Spain,[171] he was an unused substitute in England's 3\u20130 victory on 28 February.[172] Three months later he made his England debut,[58] replacing David Beckham as a second-half substitute in a 4\u20130 friendly win over Mexico.[173] His full debut came during their 2\u20131 victory over the United States on 28 May 2005.[174] Three days later Carrick started again in a 3\u20132 victory over Colombia in the final game of their tour of the US.[175] On 8 May 2006, Eriksson named Carrick in a 23-man provisional squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup,[176] eventually being named in the final 23-man squad for the tournament in Germany.[177] He was an unused substitute for all three of England's Group B games as they advanced to the knockout stage.[178] Carrick played just one game in the tournament, a 1\u20130 victory in the second round match against Ecuador on 25 June.[179] The next game he was dropped to the bench for the quarter-final tie against Portugal, with Owen Hargreaves replacing him.[180] The game ended goalless after extra time, Portugal won 3\u20131 in the subsequent penalty shootout and knocked England out of the World Cup.[181]\n\nCarrick had been regularly overlooked by various England managers when it came to the central roles, with Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard generally being preferred.[182] He started nine games under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and his successor Steve McClaren.[178] His last appearance under McClaren was in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Germany in August 2007.[183] Newly appointed manager Fabio Capello left Carrick out of his first England squad on 2 February 2008.[184] During Capello's first year in charge of England Carrick was largely overlooked.[185] However, he was named in Capello's squad for the game against the Czech Republic,[186] but was forced to withdraw after sustaining an injury during Manchester United's game with Newcastle United.[187] In November 2008, he returned to the squad for a friendly against Germany in Berlin.[188] Starting alongside Gareth Barry in central midfield in England's 2\u20131 victory, he was named as Man of the Match by the BBC.[189]\n\nDespite playing just one game during England's 2010 World Cup qualification campaign,[190] he was named in Capello's 30-man preliminary squad for the 2010 World Cup on 11 May 2010.[191] He played 61 minutes of their 3\u20131 warm-up friendly win over Mexico before being replaced by Tom Huddlestone.[192] On 2 June, Carrick was then named in the final 23-man squad to fly to South Africa for the tournament,[193] before being given the squad number 22.[194] During the World Cup Carrick failed to make it onto the pitch, remaining an unused member of the squad.[195] England were eventually knocked out of the tournament as they lost 4\u20131 to Germany in their second round tie on 27 June.[196] On 6 August, Alex Ferguson claimed Carrick would be out for two weeks with an ankle injury and would miss England's friendly against Hungary the following Wednesday.[197] Capello left Carrick out of the subsequent England squad only to arrive at Wembley and see him play 79 minutes of the Community Shield match.[198] Capello made a 'call me' sign as Carrick walked past his seat to collect the winner's medal.[199]\n\nIn May 2012, England manager Roy Hodgson said he left Carrick out of the 23-man squad and the standby list for UEFA Euro 2012 because he had previously told The Football Association that he did not want to be a bit-part player, although he could help the team \"in extremis\".[200] On 10 August, Carrick was recalled to the England squad by Hodgson for a friendly match against Italy on 15 August.[201] He played the full 90 minutes in the 2\u20131 victory over the Azzurri in Switzerland and also took over the captain's armband from Frank Lampard for the final 20 minutes.[202] On 7 September 2012, Carrick came on a half-time substitute in England's 5\u20130 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova.[203] He then started against San Marino in another 5\u20130 win the following month.[204] On 17 October 2012, Carrick partnered Steven Gerrard in central midfield in the away qualifier against Poland.[205] On 26 March 2013, the partnership was renewed in England's qualifier against Montenegro in Podgorica.[206] On 15 October 2013, Carrick started in England's final qualifier, a 2\u20130 home win against Poland, as the team qualified for the 2014 World Cup.[207][208] In May 2014, Carrick was named on England's standby list for the 2014 FIFA World Cup after being omitted from the main 23-man squad travelling to Brazil.[209]\n\nHaving not appeared since 2013, Carrick was named in the squad for the November 2014 matches with Slovenia and Scotland. However, on 12 November, he pulled out of the squad after sustaining a groin injury.[210] On 27 March 2015, Carrick made his first appearance for England in 17 months, starting the 4\u20130 UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying defeat of Lithuania at Wembley Stadium.[211] On 31 March 2015, Carrick made his 33rd appearance for the national team as a substitute for Manchester United teammate and defender Chris Smalling, performing impressively to help England earn a draw against Italy in an international friendly match.[212] On 14 November 2015, Carrick suffered an ankle injury during a match against Spain and left the pitch on a stretcher. England went on to lose the game 2\u20130.[213][214]\n\nCarrick remained at Manchester United after retirement, having been handed a position on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's coaching staff, alongside fellow new appointee Kieran McKenna; both were filling the void left by former assistant manager Rui Faria, who opted to begin his own spell in management. Mourinho was sacked by United on 18 December 2018,[215] following an indifferent first half of the season, resulting in Carrick briefly being named acting caretaker manager,[216] prior to the appointment of another former United player Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r into that position for the rest of the season.[217] Solskj\u00e6r retained Carrick as part of his coaching staff,[218] with Solskj\u00e6r and his coaching staff being appointed on a permanent basis in March 2019.[219]\n\nOn 21 November 2021, after Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r left his role as manager, Carrick was named caretaker manager.[220] Carrick's first match in charge was an UEFA Champions League tie away at Villareal, which United won thanks to late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a first United goal for Jadon Sancho, sealing United's place in the last-16 of the competition.[221] Following a 3\u20132 victory against Arsenal on 2 December, Carrick stepped down as first team coach and left Manchester United with immediate effect, shortly after the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager, who would go on to remain in the role for the rest of the season.[222] During his three match reign as caretaker manager, he recorded two wins and one draw, with United also having drawn with Chelsea in his first Premier League game.[223]\n\nOn 24 October 2022, Carrick was appointed head coach of EFL Championship club Middlesbrough.[224] Middlesbrough were at 21st position in the EFL Championship at this time, with 17 points from 16 games played, one point above the relegation zone.[225][226] Despite taking the lead, Middlesbrough lost Carrick\u2019s first game in charge 2\u20131 away to Preston North End on 29 October.[227]\n\nOn 7 December 2022, Carrick was nominated for the EFL Championship Manager of the Month award for November after his first calendar month in charge.[228]\n\n\"Carrick gives United balance and can play defensively too. He passes well, has a good shot and is a complete player.\"\n\n\u2013 Spanish midfielder Xavi on Carrick (2009)[229]\n\n\"I am a big fan of Michael Carrick. He's one of the best holding midfielders I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\n\u2013 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola (2017)[230]\n\nDespite playing as a deep-lying midfielder, Carrick did not rely on pace, stamina, physical attributes, box-to-box play and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder; instead, his intelligence and composure on reading of the game helped him to anticipate any attacking threats from the opposition team, most of the time by covering space and making interceptions.[231][232] His distribution of the ball, vision, creativity, playmaking skills, crossing ability, and range of passing, among the best in comparison to other midfielders in Europe,[4][5][138][233][234][235] was allied to an ability to dictate the tempo of the game, as well as initiate team attacks.[232][236]\n\nAfter his arrival at Manchester United in 2006, Carrick formed an effective partnership[237] with Paul Scholes, with Carrick playing in a holding role and Scholes alongside him as a deep-seated playmaker.[238] This midfield partnership contributed to a change towards a continental playing style embraced by manager Alex Ferguson and assistant Carlos Queiroz, which relied on passing and keeping possession in contrast to the more traditionally direct and all-action style of English football.[239] His unassuming style, however, also led to a lack of attention from successive England national team managers in favour of all-action midfielders such as Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, a fact noted by Carrick's former club and national team captain Wayne Rooney.[240]\n\nCarrick's intelligence and awareness were highlighted by former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, who labelled him his \"trainer coach during the game\".[241] Furthermore, his importance to the team performance was constantly praised by former teammates Gary Neville and Paul Scholes,[242] as well as European peers Xavi[229] and Xabi Alonso.[243] In 2015, The Telegraph included him at number one in their list of \"The top 20 most under-rated footballers of all time,\" describing him as an \"unassuming but highly intelligent and technically gifted deep-lying midfielder,\" who \"has consistently performed well.\"[244]\n\nCarrick married Lisa Roughead, a Pilates instructor with a business degree, in Wymondham, Leicestershire on 16 June 2007. The couple started dating when they were both at school, and have a daughter, Louise, and a son, Jacey.[9][245]\n\nIn October 2018, Carrick announced that he had suffered from depression for two years following the defeat in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final.[246]\n\nCarrick has one brother, Graeme, who is four years younger. He was also at West Ham United but suffered several injuries, and has completed an MSc in Sport Coaching is currently an FA Regional Coach Mentor (North East & Yorkshire) after 7 years as an FA Skills Coach and a spell Coaching at Team Northumbria, after previously working at the Newcastle United Academy coaching the under-10s and under-16s.[247][248]\n\nWest Ham United U18\n\nWest Ham United\n\nManchester United\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Carrick"}, {"id": 177, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/70/1390930/original/kostantinos-mitroglou-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Konstantinos Mitroglou", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/kostantinos-mitroglou/1390930", "desc": "Konstantinos \"Kostas\" Mitroglou (Greek: \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \"\u039a\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2\" \u039c\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5, pronounced [konsta(n)\u02c8dinos \u02c8kostaz \u02c8mitro\u0263lu]; born 12 March 1988) is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a striker for Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, on loan from French side Marseille, and the Greece national team.

He is nicknamed \"Mitrogoal\"[3][4] and \"Pistolero\"[5] by fans due to his goalscoring abilities.\n\nRaised in Germany, Mitroglou started his career at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, where he established himself as an excellent prospect. He was signed by Olympiacos in the summer of 2007 and had two loan spells at Panionios and Atromitos before establishing himself in the team. He transferred to Premier League club Fulham in 2013 for a club record \u00a312\u00a0million, and they were relegated in his only season, in which he was troubled by injury. He then returned to Olympiacos on loan and then to Benfica in Portugal, before joining the latter on a permanent basis in 2016. With Benfica, he would win five major honours, including back-to-back league titles, and set his single-season scoring record with 27 goals.\n\nA full international since 2009, Mitroglou has earned over 60 caps for the Greece national team. He was selected in their squads for UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nMitroglou was born on 12 March 1988, in Krinides, Kavala, Greece, and emigrated as an infant with his parents from his native country to Germany. He grew up in Neukirchen-Vluyn, North Rhine-Westphalia. He began his career at TuS Preussen Vluyn.[6] At age 11, he scored 24 goals in 16 matches.[7] He then played for SV Neukirchen.[8] In 2003, he joined MSV Duisburg. Later on, he joined Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. Mitroglou was a dominant player in the Under 19 Bundesliga. He scored 14 goals in 10 matches.[7]\n\nAfter impressing at the 2007 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, Mitroglou was signed by Greek champions Olympiacos.[9][10] His first official goal for Olympiacos came in a 2\u20131 away win against Diagoras in the Greek Cup after an assist by Luciano Galletti.[11] His first Superleague goal came in a 4\u20130 home win against Levadiakos.\n\nDuring the final stages of the season, Mitroglou played an important part in helping Olympiacos claim their 36th league title, scoring the last-minute winning goal (2\u20131) in their match against AEL, this time assisted by Mirnes \u0160i\u0161i\u0107.[12] His first goal in the Superleague came in a 4\u20130 home win against Levadiakos. He then scored two goals in the last league fixture against Iraklis to seal a 3\u20131 win. He also scored in a 2\u20132 away draw against Iraklis in the Greek Cup semi-finals, after an assist from Michalis Konstantinou. In the 2007 Greek Super Cup, he scored the only goal as Olympiacos defeated AEL 1\u20130.[13]\n\nFor the 2008\u201309 season, Olympiacos appointed Ernesto Valverde as their new head coach, who dropped Mitroglou because he wanted his team to play a quicker and more offensive style of football. Mitroglou therefore made fewer appearances than the prior season. He scored in a 2\u20130 away win against Nordsj\u00e6lland in the first round of the 2008\u201309 UEFA Cup.[14] In the Superleague, he scored two goals in a home win 4\u20131 against Panionios.\n\nAfter Valverde left Olympiacos, Mitroglou saw increased playing time.

Despite being a starter and scoring a spectacular goal in the opening league match against Iraklis (1\u20132 away loss),[21] Mitroglou only made four more appearances as Valverde chose to use Kevin Mirallas and Marko Panteli\u0107 instead. Mitroglou participated in the international match \"8th Match Against Poverty\" on 14 December 2010 (held at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium) as a player in the Olympiacos All-Star team and scored two goals.[22]\n\nIn January 2011, Mitroglou joined Panionios on a six-month loan from Olympiacos.[23] In his debut, he scored both goals in a historic 2\u20130 away win against Aris, the first for the club in 50 years.[24] His next goals came at a 1\u20131 home draw against Panathinaikos[25] and a 1\u20131 away draw against AEK Athens, the latter after an assist from Georgios Galitsios.[26] He scored the winning goal (2\u20131) against Atromitos[27] and converted a penalty at the 3\u20133 home draw against AEL.[28] He added another one at a 1\u20131 away draw against Iraklis.[29] He scored his last goal at the 2\u20131 away win against Kerkyra after an assist from Fanouris Goundoulakis.[30] Mitroglou ended this year with nine goals in the Superleague, one with Olympiacos and eight with Panionios.\n\nMitroglou was once again loaned, this time to Atromitos for the 2011\u201312 campaign.[31] He scored his first goal at a 1\u20130 away win against Aris after an assist from Miguel Sebasti\u00e1n Garcia.

After Ernesto Valverde left, Mitroglou was favoured by new head coach Leonardo Jardim. Mitroglou showed a good form in the pre-season training scoring a total of three goals, two of them in a friendly against Spanish side M\u00e1laga at the Karaiskakis Stadium.[33] However, the season started a bit irregular for him, as he had to compete with first-choice striker Rafik Djebbour in the starting 11. He therefore did not receive much playing time and often played as a substitute. His first goal of the season came in a 2\u20131 away win against PAS Giannina after an assist from Djebbour. In the same match, he provided an assist on Olympicaos' second goal, scored by Djebbour.[34]\n\nWith Djebbour absent due to injury, Mitroglou was a starter for the second group game of the UEFA Champions League against Arsenal in the Emirates Stadium, where he scored the equalizer in an eventual 3\u20131 loss.[35] He next scored a goal in a 2\u20130 home win against OFI Crete after an assist from Paulo Machado.[36] He scored again in the Champions League by scoring the winning goal in a 2\u20131 away win against Montpellier after an assist from Djamel Abdoun.[37] He also added another goal against Montpellier in the return fixture on 6 November as Olympiacos claimed a 3\u20131 victory.[38]\n\nMitroglou's scoring streak continued as he next scored two goals in a 4\u20130 away win against rivals AEK Athens,[39] and one in each 2\u20130 victory against AO Kerkyra and Panachaiki, the latter being a Greek Cup fixture.

He scored the winning goal again at the 1\u20130 away win against AO Kerkyra.\n\nMitroglou's next goals came in a comfortable 4\u20130 away win against Platanias and the classical derby against Panathinaikos, which ended 1\u20131. In the Greek Cup semi-finals against Panthrakikos, he scored two goals in the first leg to give a 6\u20132 home win and another two goals at the returning leg (2\u20131 away win) as Olympiacos progressed to the final 8\u20133 on aggregate. In the last league match, he scored the opening for a 2\u20131 home win against Panionios.[41]\n\nDuring the pre-season preparation at Seefeld, Mitroglou scored a goal in a 2\u20131 friendly win against Azerbaijani club Simurq PIK.[42]\n\nOn the second matchday of the Superleague Greece, he provided an assist to David Fuster in a 2\u20131 home win against Atromitos.

Both Zhirkov and Jucilei missed their penalties.[citation needed]\n\nOn 6 August 2013, Anzhi listed their entire squad up for sale as they announced plans to restructure the business, focusing on youth development. The first players to leave were Igor Denisov, Aleksandr Kokorin and Zhirkov on 15 August 2013, who all joined Dynamo Moscow for undisclosed fees.[19]\n\nZhirkov played 14 league matches in his first season, scoring three goals: one in a 2\u20130 win against Krylya Sovetov Samara on his 29 September debut, and two in a 4\u20132 win over former club CSKA on 9 March.[20]\n\nOn 2 October 2014, in added time at the end of their UEFA Europa League group stage match against PSV, substitute Zhirkov scored the only goal of the match for Dynamo.[21]\n\nOn 26 January 2016, Zenit Saint Petersburg announced they signed a two-year contract with Zhirkov. If Zenit and Dynamo would be not able to agree on a transfer fee during the winter 2015\u201316 transfer window, he would have joined Zenit in July 2016 as a free agent, after his Dynamo contract expired.[22] However, the two clubs agreed on transfer fee and he joined Zenit on 30 January.[23]\n\nOn 13 January 2022, he signed a contract with Khimki until the end of the 2021\u201322 season, with an option to extend for an additional year.[24] Zhirkov's contract with Khimki was terminated by mutual consent on 27 June 2022.[25]\n\nZhirkov announced his retirement from playing on 12 February 2023.[26]\n\nZhirkov made his debut for Russia on 9 February 2005, starting a 2\u20130 friendly defeat to Italy in Cagliari.[27]\n\nZhirkov was named in the UEFA Euro 2008 Team of the Tournament after helping the team to the semi-finals.[28] In October 2008, Zhirkov was named as one of the 30 nominees for the Ballon d'Or award, given to the top player in Europe.[29]\n\nOn 18 November 2009, Zhirkov received his first red card for the national side \u2013 he was sent off late in the game for a second bookable offence in the dying minutes of Russia's 0\u20131 away loss to Slovenia in the second leg of the 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off after pushing a Slovenian substitute.[citation needed]\n\nIn August 2011, Zhirkov was heckled by Russian fans during a friendly match against Serbia in Moscow nearly every time he contacted the ball; he was even bombarded with a cigarette packet near the corner area. The fans were angered by his move to Anzhi.[30]\n\nZhirkov was confirmed for Russia's Euro 2012 squad on 25 May 2012,[31] playing in all three of Russia's matches as they were eliminated in the group stage.[citation needed]\n\nOn 2 June 2014, Zhirkov was included in Russia's 2014 World Cup squad.[32] In the final preparation match for the tournament, his 61st cap, he scored his first international goal with a volley to open a 2\u20130 win over Morocco.[33] He featured in one match at the finals, playing 71 minutes of the opening 1\u20131 draw against South Korea before being replaced by Aleksandr Kerzhakov.[34] Russia again exited the tournament at the group stage.[citation needed]\n\nZhirkov scored a second international goal on 29 March 2016 in a friendly 4\u20132 loss to France at the Stade de France.[35]\n\nZhirkov was not included in Russia's squad for Euro 2016,[36] but returned for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup where he was in the starting line-up for all three of the team's matches. On 24 June 2017, he was sent off in Russia's final group match as they were beaten 1\u20132 by Mexico in Kazan.[37]\n\nOn 11 May 2018, he was included in Russia's extended 2018 FIFA World Cup squad.[38] On 3 June 2018, he was included in the finalized World Cup squad.[39] He started in the first two group-stage games, and then returned to the starting line-up in the first knock-out stage game against Spain in the Round of 16. However, his nagging injury forced him to get substituted at half-time of Spain game by Vladimir Granat, and he was not able to appear in the quarterfinal game against Croatia which Russia lost in the penalty shoot-out.[citation needed]\n\nHe announced his retirement from the national side following the World Cup.[40] Despite that announcement, he was called up to the national team once again on 16 March 2019 for Euro 2020 qualifiers against Belgium and Kazakhstan.[41] On 18 November 2020, he played his 100th match for Russia in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Nations League.[42]\n\nOn 11 May 2021, he was included in the preliminary extended 30-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020.[43] On 2 June 2021, he was included in the final squad.[44] He started Russia's opening game against Belgium on 12 June 2021, but had to be substituted in the first half due to leg injury.[45] He did not appear in Russia's two remaining games due to his injury as they were eliminated at group stage.[46][47]\n\nZhirkov has a sister and two brothers. The younger brother, Nikolai Zhirkov, played for the CSKA Youth Team. Zhirkov married on 1 February 2008 to a Russian model, Inna.[48] On 8 September 2008, their son Dmitriy was born.[48] In 2010, their daughter Milana was born[49] and in 2015 the pair had a second son.[50]\n\nZhirkov has had two automotive accidents in his life. The first accident occurred in January 2005 in Tambov. Zhirkov, driving on a high speed track, hit a pole while trying to avoid a merging racer. His airbags deployed, leaving him with only minor injuries.[citation needed] On 18 December 2008, Zhirkov was in an accident in Kaliningrad. He left this accident unharmed.\n\nYuri Zhirkov received his secondary education at school No. 19, after which he entered the school and began training in the specialty of an electrical technician. Upon graduation, he received a diploma of secondary technical education. In December 2008, Zhirkov graduated from Tambov State University[51]\n\nInternational goals\n\nRussia's score listed first.

He is the all-time top scorer and former captain of the Ivory Coast national team. He is best known for his career at Chelsea, for whom he has scored more goals than any other foreign player and is currently the club's fourth highest goal scorer of all time.

He is best known for his career at Chelsea, for whom he has scored more goals than any other foreign player and is currently the club's fourth highest goal scorer of all time. Drogba was named Chelsea's greatest ever player in a poll of 20,000 fans conducted by Chelsea FC Magazine in 2012, and he was also named in the Chelsea team of the 2010\u20132020 decade by Chelsea's fans in 2020.[6][7] He is regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time and was noted for his physical strength, speed, ability in the air, powerful and accurate strikes, and ball retention. Drogba was named African Footballer of the Year twice, winning the award in 2006 and 2009. He is also the player with the most runner-up appearances (4), most third-place finishes (3), and most times in the top three (9).\n\nAfter playing in youth teams, Drogba made his professional debut aged 18 for Ligue 2 club Le Mans, and signed his first professional contract aged 21. After finishing the 2002\u201303 season with 17 goals in 34 appearances for Ligue 1 side Guingamp, he moved to Olympique de Marseille, where he finished as the third highest scorer in the 2003\u201304 season with 19 goals and helped the club reach the 2004 UEFA Cup Final.\n\nIn July 2004, Drogba moved to Premier League club Chelsea for a club record \u00a324\u00a0million fee, making him the most expensive Ivorian player in history. In his debut season he helped the club win their first league title in 50 years, and a year later he won another Premier League title. His displays saw him named in the FIFA World XI for 2007. In March 2012, he became the first African player to score 100 Premier League goals.[8] Just two months later, he scored in Chelsea's 2012 FA Cup Final win over Liverpool to become the first (and as of 2017[update], the only) player to score in four separate FA Cup finals.[9] He also played in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, in which he scored an 88th-minute equaliser and the winning penalty in the deciding shoot-out against Bayern Munich.[10] After spending 6 months with Shanghai Shenhua in China, and one and a half seasons with Turkish club Galatasaray where he scored the winning goal in the final of the 2013 Turkish Super Cup, Drogba returned to Chelsea in July 2014.[11][12] With a career record of scoring 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies at club level, Drogba has been referred to as the \"ultimate big game player\".[13][14] He joined Canadian club Montreal Impact in 2015 as a Designated Player and played 41 matches over two seasons, scoring 23 goals. Drogba became a player\u2013owner for Phoenix Rising of the United Soccer League in 2017, and retired a year later at the age of 40. On April 21, 2022, he was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame.[15][16]\n\nAn Ivory Coast international between 2002 and 2014, Drogba captained the national team from 2006 until his retirement from the Ivory Coast team and is the nation's all-time top goalscorer with 65 goals from 105 appearances.[1][17] He led the Ivory Coast to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first appearance in the tournament, and also scored their first goal. He later captained the Ivory Coast at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups.[18] He was part of the Ivory Coast teams that reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2012, but were beaten on penalties on both occasions. On 8 August 2014, he announced his retirement from international football.[19] In 2018, Drogba retired from professional football at the age of 40.[5]\n\nActive in social issues in Africa, Drogba played a vital role in the peace process in his home country.[20] In 2007 he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, and in December 2018 he became Vice President of the international organization Peace and Sport.[21]\n\nDrogba is a member of the B\u00e9t\u00e9 people[22] He was born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and at the age of five was sent to France by his parents to live with his uncle, Michel Goba, a professional footballer. However, Drogba soon became homesick and returned to Abidjan after three years.[23] His mother nicknamed him \"Tito\", after president Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, whom she admired greatly.[24] He played football every day in a car park in the city, but his return to the Ivory Coast was short-lived. Both of his parents lost their jobs and he again returned to live with his uncle.[23] In 1991, his parents also travelled to France; first to Vannes and then, in 1993, settling in Antony in the Paris suburbs, at which point the 15-year-old Drogba returned to live with them and his siblings.[25] It was here that he began playing team football more frequently, joining a local youth side. Drogba then joined the semi-professional club Levallois, gaining a reputation as a prolific scorer in the youth team and impressing the coach with his professional attitude. His performances earned him a place in the senior squad but despite scoring in his debut, the 18-year-old Ivorian failed to make an impression on Jacques Loncar, the first team coach.[26]\n\nWhen Drogba finished school he moved to the city Le Mans to study accountancy at university and changed clubs, becoming an apprentice at Ligue 2 club Le Mans. However, his first two years there were marred by injuries and he was physically struggling to cope with the training and match schedule.[23] Former Le Mans coach Marc Westerloppe later remarked that \"it took Didier four years to be capable of training every day and playing every week\". Furthermore, Drogba had never attended a football academy and only began daily football training as an adult.[27]\n\nBy age 21, Drogba realised that he had to establish himself as a player soon or else he would have little chance of becoming a professional footballer.[28] He made his first team debut for Le Mans soon thereafter and signed his first professional contract in 1999. The same year, he and his Malian wife Alla had their first child, Isaac. He grew into his new responsibilities, later stating: \"Isaac's birth was a turning point in my life, it straightened me out\".[23] His first season, in which he scored seven goals in thirty games, boded well for the future, but during the following season he did not live up to expectations. Drogba lost his place to Daniel Cousin due to injury, then upon his return, he failed to score throughout the remainder of the season. However, he returned to form the following season, scoring five goals in 21 appearances.[29]\n\nHalfway through the 2001\u201302 season Ligue 1 club Guingamp consolidated months of interest with a transfer offer and Drogba left Le Mans for a fee of \u00a380,000.[23]\nThe second half of the 2001\u201302 season saw Drogba make 11 appearances and score three goals for Guingamp. While his contributions helped the club avoid relegation, the coaching staff remained unconvinced of their new young striker.[30] However, the next season he rewarded his coaches' patience, scoring 17 goals in 34 appearances and helping Guingamp finish seventh, a record league finish.[23] He credited his teammates for his impressive season, highlighting the contributions of winger Florent Malouda, a long time friend of Drogba, as a key factor in his goalscoring prolificity that season.[28] His strong goal scoring record attracted interest from larger clubs and at the end of the season, he moved to Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille for a fee of \u00a33.3\u00a0million.[27]\n\nAfter a switch of coaches, Drogba retained his position in the team, scoring 19 goals and winning the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Player of the Year award. He also scored five goals in that season's UEFA Champions League and six in the UEFA Cup. At the end of the season, he was bought by Chelsea as the club's then record signing for \u00a324\u00a0million.[28] His shirt from his only season at Marseille is also framed in the basilica of Marseille, Notre-Dame de la Garde, which he presented to the church before the 2004 UEFA Cup Final.[31]\n\nSigning for Chelsea in July 2004 for \u00a324\u00a0million,[32] Drogba scored in his third game for the club with a header against Crystal Palace.[33] His season was interrupted when he pulled a stomach muscle against Liverpool which kept him out of action for over two months.[34] Chelsea won the Premier League, only their second English top-flight championship and their first in 50 years,[35] and the League Cup. Later, Drogba scored in extra time in a 3\u20132 final win against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. Drogba scored a somewhat disappointing 16 goals in a total of 40 games for Chelsea in his first season: ten in the Premier League, five in the Champions League and one in the League Cup final.[36]\n\nDrogba started the 2005\u201306 season by scoring two goals in a Community Shield win over Arsenal. His reputation was marred amidst accusations of cheating during Chelsea's 2\u20130 win over Manchester City. Replays showed that he had used his hand to control the ball before scoring the second of his two goals.[37] This occurred just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where the goal was disallowed.[38]\nChelsea went on to retain the league title with two games to play, becoming only the second club to win back-to-back English titles in the Premier League era.[39] Again Drogba finished with 16 goals for the season, 12 in the Premier League, two in the Community Shield, one in the Champions League and one in the FA Cup.[40]\n\nAfter the departure of Damien Duff to Newcastle United, Drogba switched from the number 15 shirt he had worn for Chelsea since 2004 to the number 11 shirt vacated by Duff.[41] Drogba scored 33 goals in all competitions during the season (more than his tally in the previous two seasons combined), including 20 in the Premier League to win the Golden Boot.[42] In doing so, he became the first Chelsea player since Kerry Dixon in 1984\u201385 to reach 30 goals in a season, scoring 20 in the Premier League, six in the Champions League, three in the FA Cup and four in the League Cup.\n\nAmong the highlights were scoring game-winners from outside the penalty area against Liverpool, Everton (from 35 yards out) and Barcelona, a 93rd-minute equaliser against Barcelona at the Camp Nou and both Chelsea's goals in their 2\u20131 League Cup final win over Arsenal.[42][43] His goal against Liverpool saw him control the ball on his chest with his back to goal, before hitting a 20-yard half-volley on the turn. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher who was closely marking Drogba said, \"There's not a lot you can do in certain situations because they were that good.\"[42] He also completed two hat-tricks; one against Watford and the other against Levski Sofia in the Champions League, Chelsea's first hat-trick in European competition since Gianluca Vialli in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1997.[44] In his last competitive game that season, he scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium.[45] This also meant he became the only player to score in both English domestic finals in the same season and win both.[20]\n\nIn January 2007, Drogba was named the Ivorian Player of the Year, ahead of Kader Ke\u00efta, Aruna Dindane, and Kolo Tour\u00e9. In March, he was named African Footballer of the Year for the first time, ahead of Samuel Eto'o and Chelsea teammate Michael Essien.[46] His performances during the season saw him named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and runner-up to Cristiano Ronaldo in the PFA Player of the Year awards.[47]\n\nDrogba faced problems off the pitch during the end of the season as his transfer from Marseille to Chelsea in July 2004 came under scrutiny. The Stevens inquiry in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents Pinhas Zahavi and Barry Silkman.[48]\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season began badly for Drogba as he expressed his doubts about the departure of manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. He was reportedly in tears when Mourinho told him he was leaving the club, and said \"Mourinho's departure destroys a certain familiarity we had at the club. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation\".[49] Following these claims, Drogba told France Football magazine \"I want to leave Chelsea. Something is broken with Chelsea, The damage is big in the dressing room\".[50] Despite having signed a four-year contract with the club in 2006, Drogba reportedly pointed out several favoured clubs in the interview, identifying Barcelona, Real Madrid, A.C. Milan or Inter Milan as possible future destinations,[51] he later admitted he regretted this and was 100% committed to Chelsea.[50] Drogba made it up to the fans by scoring in Chelsea's 2\u20130 victory over Middlesbrough on 20 October 2007, against Schalke 04 in the Champions League four days later, and two goals against Manchester City. In December 2007, Drogba was voted fourth (after Kak\u00e1, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year.[52][53]\n\nDrogba continued scoring goals but suffered an injury at the training ground and decided to have an operation on his knee. He was unable to play for four weeks and missed key games against Valencia, Arsenal and Liverpool.[54] Drogba returned from injury to play in an FA Cup third round match against Queens Park Rangers and wore the captain's armband for the last 30 minutes he was on the pitch, but that was his last performance for Chelsea before international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations.[55] Upon his return, Drogba scored a goal in the 2008 League Cup Final, making him the all-time leading scorer in League Cup Finals with four goals, but could not help prevent Chelsea fall to a 2\u20131 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur.[56] He scored both goals in a key 2\u20131 victory against Arsenal on 23 March 2008, bringing Chelsea equal on points with leaders Manchester United.[57][58]\n\nOn 26 April 2008, Drogba faced controversy after a clash with Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidi\u0107. The Serbian centre-back had to have stitches under his lip after losing a tooth in the clash. There was discussion whether Drogba had the intention or not to injure his rival. The debate also called into question an earlier incident on 26 November 2006 where Drogba elbowed Vidi\u0107. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed concerns over elbowing in the Premier League.[59] Despite media speculation, Drogba's yellow card for the clash was deemed adequate punishment by the Football Association.[60]\n\nControversy still dogged the player as before the UEFA Champions League semi-final second leg clash with Liverpool, Drogba was accused of diving by Liverpool manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez. Ben\u00edtez claimed to have compiled a four-year dossier of Drogba's \"diving\" antics but Drogba hit back at Ben\u00edtez in an interview.[61] On 30 April 2008, Drogba scored two goals in the second leg of the semi-final against Liverpool, which Chelsea won 3\u20132 at Stamford Bridge.[62] This was the first time Chelsea had beaten Liverpool in the semi-finals of the Champions League, having lost their previous two meetings to Liverpool. This also led to Chelsea reaching their first Champions League Final. Drogba became Chelsea's top scorer in European competition, the two goals he scored put his total at 17, surpassing Peter Osgood's record of 16.[32] Drogba was sent off in the 117th minute of the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United for slapping defender Vidi\u0107,[63] becoming only the second player to be sent off in a European Cup final \u2013 after Jens Lehmann in 2006 \u2013 and the first for violent conduct.[64] Chelsea went on to lose 6\u20135 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw in extra time. Chelsea assistant boss Henk ten Cate revealed Drogba was due to take the decisive fifth spot-kick in the shootout. Team captain John Terry took his place but missed after slipping whilst taking the penalty.[65]\n\nDrogba suffered a string of injuries early on in the 2008\u201309 season and struggled to regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems.[66][67] He scored his first goal of the season in mid-November but there was little reason to celebrate: he incurred disciplinary action and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into the stands and Chelsea suffered a League Cup defeat against Burnley.[68][69] Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2\u20131 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League,[70] while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2\u20130 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008.[71] Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.[72]\n\nUpon the temporary appointment of Guus Hiddink in early February following the sacking of Scolari, Drogba enjoyed a rejuvenation of sorts, returning to his goal-scoring form with four goals in five games after the new manager took over.[73][74] His revival in form saw him net twice against Bolton Wanderers, and four times in four Champions League matches, one in each leg of the last sixteen and quarter-final of the competition against Juventus and Liverpool respectively, with these goals ensuring Chelsea's passage into the semi-finals. Just four days after his Champions League games, Drogba scored a late goal in the FA Cup semi-final match against Arsenal after Frank Lampard's pass found Drogba and he carefully rounded Arsenal goalkeeper \u0141ukasz Fabia\u0144ski before passing the ball into Arsenal's empty net.[75] Drogba also caused controversy after Chelsea's Champions League semi-final defeat at the hands of Barcelona. Feeling that many decisions had gone against Chelsea, substituted Drogba confronted referee Tom Henning \u00d8vreb\u00f8 after the final whistle. He received a yellow card in the process and was recorded shouting \"It's a fucking disgrace\"[76] into a live television camera.[77] On 17 June 2009, UEFA subsequently handed him a six-game European ban with the final two games suspended. The ban then was reduced by one match after an appeal by Chelsea.[78] In the 2009 FA Cup Final, Drogba scored Chelsea's first and equalising goal as they went on to win 2\u20131.[79] This was his sixth goal in a major cup final in England. Although Drogba had previously expressed his desire to switch clubs, he decided to remain with the Blues under new coach Carlo Ancelotti and signed a new contract.[80]\n\nDrogba began the 2009\u201310 season in fine form for Chelsea, netting a penalty during a shoot-out win in the Community Shield over Manchester United, before scoring twice in a 2\u20131 victory over Hull City. Drogba earned himself an assist when he was fouled in the penalty box to give Chelsea a penalty, which Frank Lampard converted, in a 3\u20131 victory over Sunderland. In Chelsea's third game of the season against West-London rivals Fulham, Drogba scored his third goal of the season. Drogba scored his fourth goal of the season, against Stoke City; Chelsea ended winning the game 2\u20131 with a late strike from Malouda.[81] He added a fifth at home against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 20 September.[82]\n\nHe scored his 100th goal for Chelsea in a 3\u20131 defeat against Wigan Athletic. Drogba was again important in the 2\u20130 win over title rivals Liverpool on 4 October. He assisted both goals, setting up Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda.[83] He then scored a glancing header against Blackburn on 24 October 2009, bringing his tally to eight goals in eleven appearances, scoring his third goal in as many games. Drogba continued his fine form scoring a header against Bolton Wanderers in a 4\u20130 win in the League Cup, Drogba went on to score a goal in the same week with another 4\u20130 win against Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League.\n\nAfter missing the first three Champions League matches for Chelsea with a ban for being unsportsmanlike,[84] Drogba started the fourth game against Spanish side Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. He scored two goals in the last ten minutes and the match ended 2\u20132.[85] On 29 November, Drogba scored a goal against London rivals Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, the second of which a free kick from outside the box.[86] It brought his tally for the season to 14 goals in 16 games. On 12 December, Drogba continued his performance with two goals in 3\u20133 draw against Everton.[87] Between 3 and 30 January Drogba was on Africa Cup of Nations duty and came back on 2 February against Hull City where he scored a 40th-minute equaliser to tie the game 1\u20131.[88] On 24 March, Drogba scored his 30th goal of the season in an away game against Portsmouth.\n\nOn 9 May, Drogba helped Chelsea to win the Premier League by scoring a hat-trick in an 8\u20130 win over Wigan Athletic. In doing so, he not only collected his third League winner's medal but also won the Golden Boot for the season, his second time doing so, by topping the chart with 29 league goals, beating Wayne Rooney to the title who remained on 26 goals. Both players had the same number of goals (26) before the start of their respective matches. However, during the game, Drogba appeared to be clearly angry with teammate and regular penalty taker Frank Lampard, after Lampard refused to let Drogba take a penalty which would lead Chelsea to go 2\u20130 up and give him a chance of winning the golden boot. Lampard scored the penalty, but Drogba did not celebrate with his teammates. Later on in the game though Ashley Cole was tripped in the box when Chelsea were already 5\u20130 up, and this time Lampard allowed Drogba to take the penalty, which he scored to go two goals clear of Rooney.[89]\n\nThe following week, Drogba scored the only goal of the 2010 FA Cup Final against Portsmouth from a free-kick, keeping up his record of having scored in all six English cup finals (FA Cup and League Cup) in which he has played.[90]\n\nDrogba came on as a substitute for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3\u20131 loss.[91] However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from where he left off on the last day of the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6\u20130 victory.[92] In Chelsea's next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6\u20130 win.[93]\n\nDrogba played the next game at home against Stoke City where he lasted the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas S\u00f8rensen inside the box.[94] On 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea's 2\u20130 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield.[95] It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at least a month. He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted that he would make a full recovery within days.[96]\n\nWhile playing against Norwich City on 27 August 2011, Drogba suffered a concussion in a collision with Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy.[97] After missing two games, Drogba made his return to the Chelsea squad on 24 September against Swansea City. Drogba went on scoring his first goal of the season in a 4\u20131 win.[98][99] On 29 November, Drogba rejected a new deal with Chelsea and was set to sign for the highest bidder.[100] On 31 December 2011, Drogba scored his 150th goal for Chelsea against Aston Villa, putting him level with Peter Osgood and Roy Bentley in terms of the club's top scorers of all time. Even though, Chelsea was leading with the penalty scored by Drobga, the game ended in a 3\u20131 loss for Chelsea.[101] Drogba scored his 99th Premier League goal for Chelsea on 25 February 2012, in a 3\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers.[102] Drogba scored his 100th Premier League goal for Chelsea on 10 March 2012, in a 1\u20130 win over Stoke City. He is the first African player to reach that landmark.[103]\n\nIn the dressing room before a big game, it was a different Didier, he was like an animal. His preparation, the intensity in his eyes, and then he always produced.\n\n\u2014Teammate Frank Lampard on Drogba (who scored nine goals in nine finals for Chelsea) delivering in big games.[20]\n\nDrogba scored his seventh goal at Wembley Stadium against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on 15 April, blasting the ball past former teammate Carlo Cudicini as Chelsea became 5\u20131 winners and secured a place in the FA Cup Final against Liverpool.[104] Three days later, he scored a vital goal as Chelsea beat Barcelona 1\u20130 at Stamford Bridge in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League Semi-final clash.[105] Drogba became the first player to score in four different FA Cup Finals, as he netted the winner in Chelsea's 2\u20131 triumph over Liverpool on 5 May.[106] Drogba also holds the record for most goals scored at the new Wembley Stadium with eight.[107]\n\nIn the Champions League final on 19 May 2012, Drogba scored the equaliser from Juan Mata's corner in the 88th minute, taking Chelsea into extra time and then penalties. He also scored the winning penalty in the 4\u20133 penalty shootout that led Chelsea to the victory over Bayern Munich.[108] Sir Alex Ferguson remarked: \"As far as I was concerned, he [Drogba] won the Champions League for Chelsea.\"[109] Drogba's headed effort marked his ninth goal in nine cup final appearances for Chelsea, Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola spoke after the match about Drogba's ability in big games: \"In all their very important matches he has put a stamp on it.\"[110] In November 2012, Drogba was named Chelsea's greatest ever player in a poll of 20,000 fans conducted by Chelsea FC Magazine.[6]\n\nOn 22 May 2012, Chelsea released a note on their official website announcing that Drogba would leave the club when his contract expired at the end of June 2012.[111][112] On 19 June 2012, Drogba declared he would be joining Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua, linking up with his former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka. It was reported that he signed a two-and-a-half-year deal where he would earn \u00a3200,000 a week.[113][114] On 22 July, Drogba made his debut for Shanghai Shenhua in a 1\u20131 away draw against Guangzhou R&F, coming on as a substitute for Brazilian defender Mois\u00e9s in the second half. He assisted Cao Yunding's equaliser in the 67th minute. On 4 August, he scored his first two goals in a 5\u20131 win against Hangzhou Greentown.[115] He scored two more goals on 25 August, both set up by Anelka, as Shenhua drew 3\u20133 with Shandong Luneng.[116][117]\n\nOn 28 January 2013, Drogba agreed to a one-and-a-half-year deal with S\u00fcper Lig team Galatasaray.[118][119] He would earn a sign-on fee of \u20ac4 million plus basic wage of \u20ac4 million per season, \u20ac2 million for the remaining 2012\u201313 S\u00fcper Lig and \u20ac15,000 per match.[120] However, on 30 January 2013, Shenhua released a press release that Drogba would unilaterally breach his contract if he were to join Galatasaray.[121]\n\n\n\nDrogba argued that he had not been paid his wages by the club and asked FIFA, the sport's governing body, to invalidate his contract. In February 2013, FIFA granted a temporary license for him to play for Galatasaray pending the outcome of the contract dispute.[122][123][124]\n\nOn 15 February, Drogba scored his debut goal for Galatasaray just five minutes after coming off the bench against Akhisar Belediyespor in a match that ended 2\u20131.[125] On 9 April, Drogba scored his first goal for Galatasaray in the Champions League quarter-final game, against Real Madrid. On 20 April, Drogba scored twice in a match against Elazigspor that ended 3\u20131.[126]\n\nHe won his first title with Galatasaray on 5 May, with a 4\u20132 win over Sivasspor.[127] In Galatasary's derby match against Istanbul rivals Fenerbah\u00e7e on 12 May, Drogba and his Ivorian teammate Emmanuel Eboue were subjects of racist chants from opposing fans in the team's 2\u20131 loss, but no fine or bans were handed down to the supporters or the club.[128] On 11 August, he scored the only goal in the 2013 Turkish Super Cup against the same opponents,[129] and he scored two second-half goals in a 2\u20131 away win against fellow city rivals Be\u015fikta\u015f on 22 September, although the match was abandoned due to hooliganism from fans of the opponents.[130]\n\n\nOn 25 July 2014, Chelsea announced on their official website that Drogba completed his return to the club on a free transfer, and signed a one-year contract.[11] Speaking on his move back to the club, Drogba said:\nIt was an easy decision. I couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho again. Everyone knows the special relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me.\n Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: \"He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if he comes back he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history.\"[12] On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004.[131] Mohamed Salah, who wore the number during the 2013\u201314 season, took over the number 17 shirt vacated by Eden Hazard.[132] On 15 August, however, it was announced that Drogba had been given back the number 11 shirt he previously wore at the club, with its previous occupant Oscar taking over the number 8 jersey vacated by Frank Lampard.[133]\n\nDrogba made his Premier League return for Chelsea in a 3\u20131 win away to Burnley, replacing winger Eden Hazard in the 84th minute at Turf Moor on 18 August 2014.[134] On 17 September he made the first start of his second spell, in a 1\u20131 home draw against Schalke 04 in Chelsea's first game of the Champions League group stage.[135] He scored his first goal in his second spell at Stamford Bridge on 21 October, converting a penalty kick in a 6\u20130 win over Maribor in the Champions League.[136] Five days later, with Chelsea's attack limited by injuries to Diego Costa and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, Drogba started against Manchester United at Old Trafford, making his 350th appearance for the club. Early in the second-half, he headed in the first Premier League goal of his second spell although Robin van Persie equalised in added time.[137] He scored his 50th goal in European football against Schalke 04.[138]\n\nOn 24 May 2015, Drogba announced that Chelsea's final game of the season against Sunderland would be his last as a Chelsea player.[139] He started the game as captain and was substituted with injury after half an hour, being carried off by his teammates in an eventual 3\u20131 win.[140] Drogba's final total of 104 goals was the most by an African in Premier League history until it was surpassed by Liverpool and Egypt forward Mohamed Salah in 2021.[141]\n\nOn 27 July 2015, Drogba signed a Designated Player contract with Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact, believed to be 18 months in length.[142][143] On 23 August, he made his debut in a 0\u20131 home loss against the Philadelphia Union, coming on as a substitute for Dilly Duka in the second half. On 5 September, Drogba scored a hat-trick on his first MLS start, the first player to do so in the league's history. Additionally, it was considered a \"perfect hat-trick\", with one goal scored with either foot and one with the head.[144] He was September's MLS Player of the Month after scoring 7 goals in his first 5 games in the league.[145]\n\nOn 25 October, he scored both of the Impact's goals from back heels as the team came from behind to defeat Toronto FC 2\u20131 at home in the Canadian Classique; the win gave Montreal the home advantage for their knock-out fixture against Toronto in the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs. Drogba finished the 2015 MLS regular season with 11 goals in 11 games.[146] On 29 October, Drogba scored Montreal's third goal in a 3\u20130 home win over Toronto in the knock-out round of the Playoffs, to advance to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals for the first time in the club's history;[147] they were eliminated by Columbus Crew SC.[148] He was named one of the three finalists for the 2015 MLS Newcomer of the Year Award.[149]\n\nDuring the MLS offseason, recently appointed Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink revealed interest in bringing on Drogba in a short-term coaching capacity after Drogba made a visit to Stamford Bridge to watch a Chelsea match with Hiddink and owner Roman Abramovich.[150] Montreal then reiterated their intent for Drogba to finish his contract with the club,[151] but were left uncertain until Drogba publicly confirmed his intent to play with Montreal for the 2016 MLS season on 3 March 2016.[152][153] After beginning his preseason training in Qatar away from the club, Drogba joined the Impact for the second half of their preseason training in St. Petersburg, Florida.[154] On 3 March, club technical director Adam Braz announced that Drogba would not play matches on artificial turf to begin the season due to possible implications on his knee.[153]\n\nIn July 2016, Drogba was included in the roster for the 2016 MLS All-Star Game,[155] scoring in a 2\u20131 defeat to Arsenal on 28 July.[156] On 14 October, following his exclusion from the starting lineup of a match against Toronto FC by manager Mauro Biello, Drogba refused to play for the team that night, removing his name from the squad.[157] With both his fitness, due to a lingering back injury, and his role in the team in question, Drogba did not travel with the team to, although he was in attendance at, their first postseason match at D.C. United, a 4\u20132 victory on 27 October.[158][159] Drogba did not experience the same level of success in his second regular season compared to the first, but still scored 10 goals while appearing in only 22 games, as Montreal reached the Conference Final of the 2016 Playoffs.\n\nOn 12 April 2017, after nearly four months as a free agent and declining a move to Corinthians,[160] Drogba signed for USL side Phoenix Rising FC. He also became a minority owner of the club, making him the very first player-owner in football history.[161][162]\n\nHe made his debut for the club on 10 June 2017, and scored a goal and an assist, leading the team to a 2\u20131 victory over Vancouver Whitecaps FC 2.[163] In July 2017 Drogba attracted attention after scoring an impressive last-minute free kick in a game against Orange County to tie the game.[164] On 7 August, he scored with a powerful 40-yard free kick against LA Galaxy reserve side which was followed by his classic knee-slide goal celebration in front of the bench.[165] In November 2018, at the age of 40, Drogba scored against Orange County as Phoenix won the USL Western Conference.[166] On 8 November, Phoenix lost the USL Championship game 1\u20130 at Louisville City FC. Drogba retired later that month at the age of 40,[167] but remained with his final club to work on their bid to join MLS.[5]\n\nAs the talisman of the team Drogba contributed to the Ivory Coast qualifying for its first ever FIFA World Cup, held in Germany in 2006.[168] Following the victory over Sudan that clinched World Cup qualification he also played a pivotal role in helping to end the Ivorian civil war by making an impassioned speech to the camera which resulted in a cease fire.[20]\n\nIn February 2006, Drogba captained the Ivory Coast to their second Africa Cup of Nations final, scoring the only goal in their semi-final match with Nigeria and putting away the deciding spot-kick in their record-tying 12\u201311 penalty shootout quarter-final win over Cameroon. However, they lost in the final to Egypt 4\u20132 on penalty kicks after a 0\u20130 draw, with Drogba's shot being stopped by Egyptian goalkeeper Essam El Hadary.[169]\n\nAt the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Ivory Coast were drawn in a \"group of death\" with Serbia and Montenegro, the Netherlands and Argentina.[170] On 10 June 2006, Drogba scored the first World Cup goal of his career and of his country's history in the opening game against Argentina, but his team lost 2\u20131.[171] The Ivory Coast were eliminated from the World Cup after their next game, a 1\u20132 defeat to the Netherlands, but came from 0\u20132 down to win against Serbia and Montenegro 3\u20132 in their final group game, with Drogba watching from the sidelines following suspension after picking up a yellow card in the previous two games.[172]\n\nIn the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast were drawn in a group with Nigeria, Mali and underdogs Benin. Drogba scored two goals in the group stage, opening the scoring in the 4\u20131 win over Benin,[173] as well as in the 3\u20130 win over Mali.[174] In the quarter-finals, Drogba was on the score sheet once again in the 5\u20130 win over Guinea with the last four goals coming in the final twenty minutes.[175] The semi-final was a rematch of the 2006 final against Egypt, but it was to be the end of the road for Drogba and the Ivory Coast, losing 4\u20131 to the eventual champions.[176] On 9 February, Drogba lost 4\u20132 to hosts Ghana and thus ended their run in the playoffs.[177]\n\nDrogba scored six goals in five qualification games to help the Ivory Coast qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations Drogba scored one goal in the 3\u20131 victory against Ghana in the group stage. The Ivory Coast reached the quarter-finals but lost 2\u20133 to Algeria.[178][179] In March 2010, he was named as the 2009 African Footballer of the Year, his second time winning the award in his career.[180]\n\nOn 4 June 2010, Drogba was injured in a friendly match with Japan. He received the injury in a high challenge from defender T\u00falio Tanaka. He fractured the ulna in his right arm and had an operation the next day in the hope of making the finals.[181] On 15 June 2010, Drogba was cleared by FIFA to play in the Ivory Coast's first group game against Portugal wearing a protective cast on his broken arm.[182] The match ended in a goalless draw at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium with Drogba coming on in the 65th minute.[183] On 20 June 2010, Drogba became the first player from an African nation to score against Brazil in a World Cup match, scoring with a header in the 78th minute as the Ivory Coast were defeated 1\u20133.[184][185] On 25 June 2010, the Ivory Coast went out of the competition despite winning 3\u20130 against North Korea in their final match.[186]\n\nIn the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, the Ivory Coast were drawn in a group with Sudan, Angola and Burkina Faso. Drogba scored the first goal for his team in the tournament against Sudan and his only goal in the group stage. In the quarter-finals, Drogba scored twice in the 3\u20130 win over Equatorial Guinea but he missed a penalty kick where he could have scored hat-trick in the match and tournament. He did not score in the semi-final in which the Ivory Coast beat Mali 1\u20130. In the final against Zambia, Drogba missed a penalty kick in the last 15 minutes of the game, which ended with their loss for the second time by penalty shootout.[187]\n\nIn June 2014, Drogba was named in the Ivory Coast's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[188] He won his 100th international cap in a pre-tournament friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina, scoring a penalty kick in his side's 2\u20131 loss on 2 June.[189] In the Ivory Coast's opening match, he appeared as a second-half substitute with the team trailing 1\u20130 to Japan. Within five minutes of Drogba's arrival, Les \u00c9l\u00e9phants scored twice to win the match 2\u20131.[190] On 8 August 2014, Drogba announced his retirement from international football with a record of 65 goals in 105 appearances.[1][19]\n\nGiven his relatively late breakthrough into professional football, Drogba has often been described as a late bloomer, having signed his first professional contract with Le Mans at the age of 21.[191] He was noted for his physical strength, speed, ability in the air, powerful and accurate strikes, and ball retention.[192][193] Initially a right-back in his youth, due to his ability to hold-up the ball with his back to goal, he often played as a centre-forward throughout his professional career, and has been described as \"the definition of 'target man'\" by Martin Li of Bleacher Report.[194][195][196] Richard Beech of the Daily Mirror says that his \"powerful and intrusive approach made him the lone striker Jos\u00e9 Mourinho grew to admire, and made it nearly impossible for opposing teams to isolate him and freeze him out of the game.\"[197] Carl Anka of the BBC writes, \"Drogba's robust playing style was so effective that he spearheaded the movement of the Premier League from the 4\u20134\u20132 era to a time where the 4\u20133\u20132\u20131 formation was king.\"[20]\n\nDrogba is renowned for performing in big games, with a goalscoring record at club level of 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies.[13][14] Carl Anka writes, \"Local derbies, top four six-pointers, title challenges or cup finals \u2014 if the game was big, Drogba got bigger\".[20] Drogba was also capable of providing assists to his teammates. Between the 2009\u201310 and 2011\u201312 seasons, he managed 24 assists in the Premier League, with an average pass success rate of 61.4 percent, owing to his vision and creativity on the ball.[198] He provided 71 assists to teammates over the course of his entire career at Chelsea until May 2012, showing that he is also a team player.[199]\n\nDrogba was also known for his free kick ability where he would strike the ball with power and pace. Dr. Ken Bray of the University of Bath has described him as a specialist especially from central positions, and says that he \"really just passes the ball very hard\". He adds, \"He hits it [the ball] very straight and appears to hit the ball with a very powerful side-foot action, almost like the technique used in a side-foot pass. Drogba's style is about beating the goalkeeper with speed and depth.\"[201] Bleacher Report states he adopted the \"knuckle ball\" technique developed by Juninho Pernambucano where the ball has almost no spinning motion during flight.[202] Drogba's trademark goal celebration saw him slide on his knees accompanied with an arm pump and a salute to fans \u2013 his celebration appears in EA Sports' FIFA video game.[165][203]\n\nOne of the greatest African players ever, Drogba is usually ranked among the three greatest African strikers, alongside George Weah and Samuel Eto'o.[193][200] Drogba's diverse and robust playing style has seen him frequently cited as the toughest striker numerous defenders have had to face, these include Gerard Piqu\u00e9,[204] Carles Puyol,[205] Chris Smalling,[206] Nemanja Vidi\u0107,[207] and Laurent Koscielny.[208]\n\nDrogba was married to Lalla Diakit\u00e9, a Malian woman whom he met in Paris, and the couple have three children together. His eldest son, Isaac, was born in France in 1999, grew up in England and has played in the Chelsea academy system.[23] He signed for French club Guingamp in February 2018.[209] Drogba has two younger brothers who are also footballers: Jo\u00ebl and Freddy Drogba. Freddy, born in 1992, joined French Ligue 1 side Dijon FCO, and played for the youth team.[210][211][212][213] He is a devout Roman Catholic.[214][215] His uncle, Michel Goba, is also a professional footballer and Ivorian international, and his cousin K\u00e9vin Goba (Michel's son) is a professional footballer who played in the lower leagues of France.[216]\nIn a statement post on Instagram, Drogba confirmed their divorce with wife of almost two decades Lala, adding that it was a mutual agreement between himself and his Lalla.\n\u201cI'm not in the habit of discussing my private life,\u201d the 2012 UEFA Champions League winner wrote.\n\u201cBut because of speculation in the media today, I can confirm that sadly, after 20 years together, Lalla and I took the difficult decision to separate last year.\n\u201cWe remain very close and our main priorities have been to protect our children and our family's private life. May God bless you.\u201d[217]\n\nSome players win trophies. Others inspire people. It is not hyperbole to say Didier Drogba did both and helped to end a civil war.\n\n\u2014Carl Anka for the BBC, Didier Drogba was the 'clutch' centre-forward who united a nation.[20]\n\nDrogba is credited with playing a vital role in bringing peace to his country.[218] After the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 World Cup by defeating Sudan on 8 October 2005, Drogba made a desperate plea to the combatants, asking them to lay down their arms, a plea which was answered with a cease fire after five years of civil war.[20] Carl Anka writes, \"torn by religious and political tensions, Drogba seized a unifying moment for his country and invited TV cameras into the Elephants changing room where he made a speech to the camera. The man spoke and a nation listened \u2014 the elections went off without bloodshed.\"[20] Drogba later helped move an African Cup of Nations qualifier to the rebel stronghold of Bouake, a move that helped confirm the peace process.[219] On 24 January 2007, Drogba was appointed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a Goodwill Ambassador. The UNDP were impressed with his previous charity work and believed that his high-profile would help raise awareness on African issues.[220] In September 2011, Drogba joined the Truth, Reconciliation and Dialogue Commission as a representative to help return peace to his home nation.[221] His involvement in the peace process led to Time magazine naming Drogba one of the world's 100 most influential people for 2010.[222]\n\nDrogba's charity work continued when, in late 2009, he announced he would be donating the \u00a33\u00a0million signing on fee for his endorsement of Pepsi for the construction of a hospital in his hometown of Abidjan.[223] This work was done through Drogba's recently created \"Didier Drogba Foundation\" and Chelsea announced they too would donate the fee for the deal toward the Foundation's project. Drogba decided on building the hospital after a recent trip to the Ivorian capital's other hospitals, saying \"I decided the Foundation's first project should be to build and fund a hospital giving people basic healthcare and a chance just to stay alive.\"[223] The same year, Drogba teamed up with sportswear company Nike (whom he is sponsored by) and U2 frontman Bono on the eve of World AIDS Day to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[224] Drogba said, \"It's a big honour and pleasure for me to be linked with Bono and try to help him save some lives. AIDS and HIV is something that really destroyed Africa, and people don't really realise how easy it is to save lives \u2014 only two pills a day, which is 40 cents.\"[224]\n\nIn November 2014, Drogba appeared in FIFA's \"11 against Ebola\" campaign with a selection of top football players from around the world, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Gareth Bale and Xavi.[225] Under the slogan \"Together, we can beat Ebola\", FIFA's campaign was done in conjunction with the Confederation of African Football and health experts, with the players holding up eleven messages to raise awareness of the disease and ways to combat it.[225] On 22 February 2018, Drogba, former AC Milan striker and current Liberia President George Weah, and teenage French prodigy Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 had a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris that focused on a sports development project in Africa.[226][227]\n\nAs a UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, Drogba has taken part in the annual Match Against Poverty alongside Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane. He has appeared in the 2012 and 2015 games.[228] Levallois Sporting Club, the amateur club where Drogba began his career, used their percentage of his transfer fees\u00a0 including \u00a3600,000 out of the \u00a324\u00a0million paid when he joined Chelsea\u00a0\u2013 first to ensure the club's survival, and then to improve their stadium to incorporate modern sports facilities for the benefit of the local community. They renamed the new stadium Stade Didier Drogba after him.[229]\n\nIn 2018, Drogba was appointed Vice President of Peace and Sport, an independent organisation based in Monaco and under the patronage of Prince Albert II of Monaco that works in areas across the world where communities have become estranged from one another.[230] In June 2021, he received an honorary degree from RUSTA, due to his contributions to the growth of the game of football and restoration of stability in his home country.[231]\n\nOn 2 December 2019, Drogba co-hosted the 2019 Ballon d\u2019Or ceremony in Paris alongside journalist Sandy Heribert.[232] On 29 November 2021 the duo co-hosted the next ceremony in 2021 which saw Lionel Messi receive the men's award for a record seventh time whilst Alexia Putellas won the Ballon d'Or F\u00e9minin.[233][234]\n\nChelsea\n\nGalatasaray\n\nPhoenix Rising\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Drogba"}, {"id": 180, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/23/459520/original/andrew-mcleod-athletes-photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Andrew McLeod", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/andrew-mcleod/459520", "desc": "Andrew Luke McLeod (born 4 August 1976) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

He was also awarded the", "full_desc": "\n\nAndrew Luke McLeod (born 4 August 1976) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is the games record holder for Adelaide, having played 340 games.\n\nMcLeod is considered by many as the greatest player to have played for the Adelaide Football Club.[1] Mcleod won two premierships for the Adelaide Football Club in 1997 and 1998. He was also awarded the Norm Smith Medal for best on ground in the 1997 and 1998 AFL grand finals.\n\nMcLeod was born in Darwin, Northern Territory. He is Indigenous with Wardaman and Warrgamay descent[2] through his mother, while his father Jock McLeod is of Scottish descent. McLeod had an older sister and older brother and was the family's youngest child.[3] When McLeod was young, his family moved to Katherine, near Wardaman country, before returning to Darwin in early 1985.[3]\n\nAs a child, McLeod supported the Essendon Football Club, and he also had experiences with AFL player and Darwin local Michael McLean.[2]\n\nMy idol was Michael Mclean, number 51. I loved watching him play. He always gave me time when he came home. Seeing him on TV on the Winners and then when he came home you got to sit down with him and have a chat. He'd talk about what training you needed to do and the big league. I still keep in touch with him.\nMcLeod played a variety of sports as a junior, including athletics, soccer, rugby union, rugby league and Australian rules football.[4] His family had a long history of playing for the Darwin Football Club in the Northern Territory Football League, starting with his great-grandfather Put,[5] down to his father, who had played over 200 games,[6] so McLeod also began playing for their senior team in 1993.[7] As a gifted player, he was selected to represent the Northern Territory in the Teal Cup,[2] where he was voted best-on-ground in the team's win against Victoria.[7]\n\nPort Adelaide Football Club chief executive officer Brian Cunningham called McLeod's father Jock to offer McLeod a contract to play for Port Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League for $250 per game. Jock knew that moving to Adelaide to play football would be daunting for McLeod, so he secretly negotiated with Port Adelaide to drop his son off at in Adelaide then leave. The pair drove to Adelaide and stayed in the home of the Duffield family, who were Port Adelaide supporters. McLeod wasn't told that he'd be staying behind until the morning that his father left him there.[8] Despite the rough start, McLeod very quickly rose through the ranks of the Port Adelaide team. He started by playing one game in the Under-17s side, followed by one game in the Under-19s side and four games in the reserves side, then finishing the season with 14 consecutive games in the senior team, including becoming a premiership player by winning the 1994 SANFL Grand Final.[2][9]\n\nThe Fremantle Football Club was entering the Australian Football League in the 1995 season, and as part of the recruitment concessions they have been given, they sought to recruit McLeod. When McLeod met with Fremantle, coach Gerard Neesham had not actually seen him play before and asked McLeod to stand up to show how tall he was. McLeod felt insulted and belittled and refused to play for Fremantle.[10] Adelaide's recruiter Tim Johnson heard that the negotiations weren't going well, so Adelaide Football Club general manager Bill Sanders contacted McLeod's father to let him know the club was interested in recruiting him. Adelaide and Fremantle negotiated a trade the day before the trading deadline, with Fremantle receiving forward Chris Groom in return. The Crows had to compete for McLeod with Collingwood, who had offered an inducement to McLeod's father if he was able to convince McLeod to sign with them.[11]\n\nAdelaide players initially gave McLeod nickname \"Hamburger\" because he was seen as chubby,[2][12] but soon adopted the nickname \"Bunji\" (which means \"Brother\") that he had been given while playing in Darwin.[12] He made his AFL debut for the Crows in their Round 6 match against Melbourne, which the Crows won but 8 points, but McLeod spent most of the game on the interchange bench and only touched the ball four times through the game.[2][13][14] McLeod was dropped after this game, then played his second game in Round 9 against Hawthorn. Adelaide trailed Hawthorn by 34 points at half time, but launched a comeback in the second half. They were still down by 4 points in the dying seconds of the game. The ball was kicked inside Adelaide's forward 50, and McLeod raced at the ball, competing with Hawk defender Ray Jencke. He was able to recover the ball, evade Jenke's attempts to tackle him, and kick a dribbling goal from a tight angle to win the game for Adelaide.[11][15]\n\nMcLeod, somehow, miraculously gathers possession of this wet and slippery ball, arches his back, goes one way and then the other and leaves Jenke slipping and sliding in his wake. Then, against the pressure of time and finding himself in a position to somehow conceive a way to win, he calmly caresses the greasy ball onto and across his boot and dribbles it through the goals in an arc from the boundary.\nLater in the year, McLeod was nominated for the Norwich Rising Star award,[12] but he discovered towards the end of the 1995 season that he had broken several bones in his feet, and he had to have injections in his feet to play the last seven rounds without pain. The injuries came as a result of McLeod being forced to wear boots made by Adidas, who were a Crows sponsor at the time. Adidas boots didn't fit McLeod's foot shape, so once it became apparent that the shoes were causing his injuries, McLeod started wearing Puma boots with Adidas stripes painted on them. This lasted until he signed an exclusive agreement with Adidas to have them custom-make shoes that would fit his feet from 1998 on.[17]\n\nMcLeod's breakout year came in 1997 under Adelaide's new coach, Malcolm Blight. During pre-season training Blight had the team doing a lot of running, which helped McLeod lose a significant amount of weight.[2][11] Blight had first seen McLeod in the 1995 game against Hawthorn that saw him kick the winning goal, so Blight played him in the forward line until he had a discussion with Stephen Williams, who had been McLeod's coach at Port Adelaide in the SANFL. Williams said that he had been used at half-back, so Blight had McLeod play there for the rest of the season.[11]\n\nI said to Stephen: \u2018What about Andrew?\u2019. He said, \u2018Well, we got him as a half-back flanker from Darwin\u2019. And that was almost the light bulb moment for me. ... McLeod slotted in there beautifully. Some of the games he played there in \u201997, he was almost faultless, he could beat his man, and then set us up.\nMcLeod had a standout moment in Round 19 in Showdown II against Port Adelaide, kicking a difficult goal in the final minutes to give the Crows a 7-point lead that they carried to the end of the game.[11]\n\nIn the preliminary final against the Western Bulldogs, McLeod, who had been playing primarily as a forward or half-back flanker, was placed into the midfield in the second half by Blight in an effort to spark the Crows side, who trailed by 31 points at half-time. It would be the first time in McLeod's career that he would play in the midfield; and, in a thrilling contest, McLeod and the Crows would win the match by two points to reach the Grand Final for the first time in the club's history.\n\nIn the Grand Final against St Kilda, McLeod would take his first significant step in his journey towards joining the game's elite. Accumulating 31 disposals and 11 marks, he was judged best on ground against the Saints, winning the prestigious Norm Smith Medal while helping his team win the AFL premiership. This was followed shortly thereafter with a gold jacket when he was named as the Crows best and fairest for the 1997 season.\n\nBecause McLeod's success, the Brisbane Lions approached him with an offer to move clubs, but McLeod chose to stay with Adelaide.[11]\n\nHaving caught the eye of football followers with his magical feats in the 1997 finals, McLeod would continue to dazzle crowds with his pace and agility in 1998 before being named in the All-Australian team for the first time in his career despite only playing 15 games due to injury.[18] He would also get 10 Brownlow Medal votes in 1998 after only 1 vote in 1997.\n\nIn a preliminary final rematch against the Bulldogs, McLeod would kick a career-high seven goals while being opposed to Tony Liberatore, who was reputed to be the most ferocious tagger in the game at the time. In the following game\u2014against Grand Final favourites, the Kangaroos\u2014the Crows would win by 35 points, with McLeod emulating his feats from a year earlier. Gathering 30 disposals and winning back-to-back Norm Smith Medals, McLeod became the first player to win two Norm Smith Medals since Gary Ayres in 1986 and 1988.\n\nAdelaide would not match the success of the two previous seasons in 1999 and would finish 13th; however, McLeod continued on progressing as one of Adelaide's young stars, gathering 7 Brownlow votes.\n\nMcLeod had an outstanding season in 2000, playing most of the season in the midfield. He averaged 24 disposals per game, an increase from 18 in 1999, and kicked 28 goals. He made the All-Australian team as a half-forward, narrowly finished second in Adelaide's Best and Fairest to Simon Goodwin, and polled 20 Brownlow Medal votes, finishing third behind Shane Woewodin and runner-up Scott West.\n\nMcLeod had perhaps the finest season of his career in 2001, controversially being named runner-up in the Brownlow Medal Count. Having been made a permanent fixture in the Crows midfield by coach Gary Ayres, McLeod averaged a career-best 24.7 disposals.[19] He would win the Leigh Matthews Trophy to be recognised as the Most Valuable Player in the league, according to a vote by his peers in the AFL Players Association, as well as his second best-and-fairest award from the club.\n\nMcLeod, however, would be denied the AFL's greatest individual honour in the 2001 Brownlow Medal. The Crows had arranged for McLeod's father Jock to come to the Brownlow count without his knowledge as a surprise for if McLeod won.[11] Trailing by two votes in the last round to Jason Akermanis of the Brisbane Lions, he had amassed a season-high 37 disposals in Adelaide's final round loss to Fremantle; however, he was awarded no votes in that game, and he consequently finished second behind Akermanis. Akermanis later wrote, \"I stole the Brownlow from Andrew McLeod,\" as McLeod was a raging favourite and won the majority of media awards for the year.[20]\n\nMcLeod had another fine season in 2002, but he was reported in round 4 for the first and only time in his career due to a late charge on Essendon's Matthew Lloyd. McLeod received a one-match ban for the incident, playing every other game of the season and amassing 16 Brownlow votes; however, he only finished equal 6th in the best and fairest.\n\nMcLeod played every game of the home-and-away season in yet another superb year.[citation needed] He would lead the 2003 Brownlow medal count until round 15, remarkably having six best-on-ground performances up until that point, according to the officiating umpires of matches McLeod played in. However, McLeod never got any more votes and would finish 10th with 18 votes, although the margin was only 4 points between McLeod and the joint winners; teammate Mark Ricciuto was one of these players. He would finish 3rd in the Adelaide best and fairest.\n\n2004 was a disappointing year for Adelaide, and coach Gary Ayres would be sacked later in the year. McLeod only polled two votes in the Brownlow despite a season disposal average of 21.\n\nIn 2005, under coach Neil Craig, McLeod made a return to the half-back line to provide his side with run and drive from defence using his sublime skills. McLeod polled 11 votes in the 2005 Brownlow Medal.\n\nIn October, McLeod was named co-captain of the Australian International rules football team against Ireland. In what became a somewhat spiteful match, Australia would win comfortably, while McLeod was named best player and awarded the Jim Stynes Medal.[18]\n\nIn 2005, McLeod was named in the Indigenous Team of the Century in the position of ruck rover.[11]\n\nAfter a year under Neil Craig's system, McLeod would return to some of his best form, leading to his 4th All-Australian selection.[18]\n\nAgainst the Essendon Football Club in round 10 at AAMI Stadium, McLeod played his 250th AFL game, where he tallied 18 disposals while soaring for a spectacular mark in a 138-point demolition of the Bombers.[21]\n\nFor much of the season, however, McLeod played with a bursa in his left foot. After round 16, the decision was made for him to undergo surgery to remove the bursa, an operation expected to keep him out for a few weeks.\n\nMcLeod made a relatively earlier-than-expected return to the side in round 19. However, by round 21, after a disappointing loss to Port Adelaide, his foot was heavily infected, and the club announced that he would require further surgery along with the disappointing news that he would more than likely miss the rest of the season and finals.[22] McLeod's injury would later prove to be a huge blow to Adelaide's premiership chances.\n\nDespite rating himself just a \"two out of ten\" chance to return for the finals,[23] McLeod made a surprise return to the side in the preliminary final against the West Coast Eagles. After a promising first half, however, McLeod and the Crows were swamped by the West Coast midfield in the second half to eventually lose by ten points. McLeod only polled seven votes in the 2006 Brownlow Medal despite averaging 22 possessions and being named All-Australian. He finished 4th in Adelaide's best and fairest.[24]\n\nPrior to the start of the AFL 2007 season, McLeod won the Polly Farmer Medal after being the best for the Indigenous All-Stars in a 50-point loss to Essendon. McLeod, the side's captain, kicked two goals to be his team's leading goalkicker.\n\nMcLeod played most of 2007 again as a half-back flanker, sweeping up loose balls and creating his trademark run out of defence with his smooth skills. McLeod, however, was well held in his final game of the season, finishing with just 12 disposals after being heavily tagged by Hawthorn's Richard Vandenberg in Adelaide's elimination final loss to the Hawks.\n\nNevertheless, McLeod had a fine season; his average of 23.9 disposals was his highest since finishing runner-up for the Brownlow Medal in 2001. This was duly acknowledged when he was announced as captain and a half-back flanker of the 2007 All-Australian team.[25] McLeod polled 15 votes in the 2007 Brownlow Medal and won the club's Best and Fairest award.\n\nFour weeks after returning from a stint on the sidelines due to knee surgery, McLeod celebrated his 300-game milestone with a 63-point victory over Richmond in round 19. Andrew McLeod is just the second Aboriginal player to reach 300 games. After the season's conclusion, however, McLeod's knee flared up again, forcing him to have surgery during the off-season.\n\nOn his return from injury, McLeod captained the Indigenous All-Stars in the 2009 pre-season.[26] McLeod continued to perform consistently for the Crows, and in round 9 (fittingly, it was Indigenous Round) he played his 313th game, breaking the club games record held by former teammate and good friend Mark Ricciuto.[27]\n\nMcLeod began the 2010 season healthy and in decent form. However, in a round 11 match against Fremantle, he re-injured his troubled right knee, ultimately keeping him sidelined for a month.[28] He returned on 16 July 2010 in a round 16 match against Geelong in which Adelaide won by 11 points. This would ultimately be McLeod's last game of AFL football, as his knee continued to have problems.[29]\nOn 23 August 2010, McLeod announced his retirement from AFL football.[30][31] \nAndrew McLeod's retirement announcement:\n\n\"To the supporters of the Adelaide Football Club, I thank you for sharing my journey and making it a most memorable one. To all my coaches, I am eternally grateful for passing on your knowledge to make me a better player and a person, And finally to my teammates, past and present, without you guys, nothing I have achieved in footy would have been made possible if it weren\u2019t for all of you. Thanks for making it the most amazing journey, one I can only dream of\"[32]\n\nFollowing his retirement, McLeod has been compared with Jason Akermanis and Ben Cousins as three greats of the AFL who all retired in 2010.[18]\n\nIn 2011, McLeod signed a part-time contract with the Northern Territory Football Club in the inaugural North East Australian Football League season, and played a total of eight games for the Thunder, including the finals series. McLeod was a part of the Thunder's Northern Conference and NEAFL premiership teams.[33]\n\nIn 2005, McLeod and former friend tennis player Lleyton Hewitt had a much publicised dispute over the use of footage shot at Aboriginal sacred sites in a DVD Hewitt was to release.[35]\n\nMcLeod admitted in 2018 in a podcast that he doesn\u2019t feel welcome at his old club in the Crows saying \u201cthe Crows doesn't really have that vibe\" referring to other clubs having players come to their former clubs and feel welcomed back.[36]\n\n\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McLeod"}, {"id": 181, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/57/1133561/original/harry-kewell-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Harry Kewell", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/harry-kewell/1133561", "desc": "Harold Kewell (; born 22 September 1978) is an Australian football coach and former player who was most recently the manager of National League club Notts County.

His most recent role as a club manager was at English National League side Barnet, and he is currently a first team coach at Celtic.[5]\n\nAs a player, Kewell represented Leeds United, Liverpool, Galatasaray, Melbourne Victory, Al-Gharafa and Melbourne Heart. While at Leeds he was named the PFA Young Player of the Year in 2000. Internationally, he received 58 caps, and scored 17 goals while playing for Australia. A left winger also capable of playing as an attacking midfielder or second striker, he is often regarded within the media as \"Australia's finest football export\",[6] despite his career being blighted with injury.[7][8] In 2012, Kewell was named Australia's greatest footballer in a vote by Australian fans, players and media.[9][10][11]\n\nKewell scored a goal against Croatia which took Australia through to the knockout stages of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Australian national team's second World Cup. He is a member of the Executive Committee of the Australian Professional Footballers' Association.[12] Kewell also has a British passport through his father's heritage. Former Middlesbrough midfielder-turned pundit Robbie Mustoe named Kewell as one of the greatest players he had played against but questioned his consistency and attitude after his initial injuries.[13] Former German international Michael Ballack has also highlighted Kewell's ability and inconsistency.[14]\n\nKewell has represented Australia at the 1995 FIFA U-17 World Championship, the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, where Australia finished runners-up, the 2004 OFC Nations Cup, which Australia claimed for the fourth time, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, where Australia finished runners-up.\n\nHarry Kewell[15] was born on 22 September 1978 in Sydney, New South Wales,[16] to an English father, Rod, and an Australian mother, Helen. Harry grew up supporting Liverpool in English football's First Division. Kewell received his early schooling at Smithfield Public School[17] and secondary schooling at St. Johns Park High School before transferring to Westfield Sports High School.[18] Before becoming a teenager he played junior football for Smithfield Hotspurs (now Fairfield Hotspurs) before switching to Marconi Fairfield as a teenager.\n\nAt age 14, Kewell travelled to Thailand, Italy and England with the successful Marconi under-14 team that had recently won the state titles. The team played games against the junior team of Milan, as well as apprenticeship sides in England. This was the first time Kewell had been out of the country but provided him his first taste of football in Europe, having also attended a Premier League match for the first time as a spectator. At age 15, Kewell was offered the opportunity to travel back to England and trial with Premiership football club Leeds United for a period of four weeks as part of the Big Brother Movement in Australia. Kewell travelled to England with his future Socceroo teammate Brett Emerton. Both were successful during their trials at Leeds, however only Kewell was able to take up the club's offer due to his father's English heritage, which satisfied the visa requirements.[19]\n\nKewell played for three seasons in the Leeds United youth team. His first match for the youth team was against Sunderland in 1995, and he scored his first hat-trick against Rotherham on 7 December 1996.[4] Kewell was handed his first team debut at age 17 in a 1\u20130 home defeat against Middlesbrough on 30 March 1996.[20][21][22][23] In 1997, Kewell was part of the Leeds United youth-team that claimed the 1996\u201397 FA Youth Cup final in a 3\u20131 aggregate win against Crystal Palace. The first goal he scored for Leeds came some time later, in October 1997, in a 3\u20131 League Cup victory over Stoke City. Around that time, he was flatmates with Leeds goalkeeper Nicky Byrne,[24] who would later become a member of boyband Westlife.\n\nKewell was sent off in the Leeds United-Galatasaray 1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup semi-final match.[25] Playing mostly in a left midfield role and in attack, Kewell became one of Leeds' young stars in a troop of highly promising youngsters, eventually playing alongside fellow Australian Mark Viduka.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, on the back of his most successful season at Leeds where he also won PFA Young Player of the Year was selected in the PFA Team of the Year, Italian giants Internazionale had bid \u00a325\u00a0million for Kewell, but Leeds rejected the offer, citing his value to their side.[26] The high point of this period was when Kewell helped Leeds to the semi-final of the UEFA Champions League in 2000\u201301.[27] The club, however, began to suffer financial difficulties and, by 2002\u201303, having sold many of their best players, Kewell's efforts in front of goal merely delayed Leeds' slide from being relegated from the Premiership. Kewell's efforts at Leeds United gained him international recognition for his talents. He scored 45 goals in over 180 appearances for Leeds over eight years.[28][29]\n\nKewell left Leeds under acrimonious circumstances. In an interview given to the BBC shortly before his move to Liverpool, Kewell strongly criticised the staff at the club, stating that the medical staff loved Lucas Radebe and that his teammates had ostracised him.[30]\n\nHaving rejected more financially enticing offers from Milan,[26] Chelsea,[26] Manchester United,[26][31] Arsenal[26] and Barcelona,[26][32] Kewell moved to the club he supported as a boy, Liverpool, for the start of the 2003\u201304 season.[33] Kewell was handed the famous number seven shirt, surrendered by Vladim\u00edr \u0160micer.[34]\n\nKewell's transfer was controversial because it was alleged by former England captain Gary Lineker in an article in July 2003 that a significant portion (\u00a32\u00a0million of the \u00a35\u00a0million) went to Kewell's unregistered agent Bernie Mandic to ensure that he ended up at Anfield.[35][36] In a related matter, Kewell sued Lineker in 2005 for defamation of character, but, with the jury unable to agree on a verdict, the parties had to settle out of court.[37]\n\nKewell made his debut for Liverpool in the opening game of the 2003\u201304 Premier League season, a 2\u20131 home loss to Chelsea on 17 August 2003.[38] Kewell scored his first ever goal for Liverpool in a 3\u20130 away win over great rivals Everton in the Merseyside derby with a great first time strike. Kewell completed his first ever season at Anfield equal second with Emile Heskey by scoring seven goals, nine behind Michael Owen as Liverpool's top goalscorer for the 2003\u201304 Premier League season. Kewell also finished as Liverpool's top scorer in the 2003\u201304 UEFA Cup, scoring goals against Olimpija Ljubljana, Steaua Bucure\u0219ti and Levski Sofia which ended Kewell's season total of ten goals. Kewell kicked off his 2004\u201305 season poorly, failing to score in his first 14 matches, due to injury problems. He did finally score his first goal in round 15 of the Premier League in a 1\u20131 away draw against Aston Villa, and that was his only Premier League goal of the season, making this one of his worst seasons ever. Kewell started and played in the 2005 League Cup final and the 2005 Champions League final.\n\nOn 25 May 2005, Kewell became the first Australian-born player (Craig Johnston was born in South Africa) to win a major UEFA competition, when he became the only Australian to win the UEFA Champions League, playing in Liverpool's win over Milan in the 2005 Champions League final on penalties. Kewell was controversially selected by manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez ahead of the defensive midfielder Dietmar Hamann, signalling the club's intent to attack from the outset. The gamble proved unsuccessful, and an injured Kewell was substituted early in the first half with a torn abductor muscle. Liverpool were losing 1\u20130 at the time and Kewell was booed off the pitch by Liverpool fans with many suggesting he had faked the injury.[39][40] It also emerged during the summer of 2005 that Kewell had been playing throughout the season with an undiagnosed sports hernia, also known as \"Gilmore's groin\".[citation needed] His record as the only Australian to win a major UEFA tournament came to an end on 18 May 2022 when Ajdin Hrustic became the second Australian to win a UEFA competition, though this occurred in the UEFA Europa League.[41]\n\nIn November 2005, after recovering from the injury sustained during the final, Kewell spoke to the official Liverpool website, saying that he had a strong desire to repay his manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez for showing confidence in him by fielding him in the Champions League final.[42] He also thanked his wife and friends for the support shown to him while he recovered from injury.[42] He also re-stated the severity of the injury which had forced him off in the final and told his doubters that they were misguided to question the severity of his injury.[42]\n\nKewell's form for Liverpool in the 2005\u201306 FA Premier League season showed what he was truly capable of, scoring goals and plenty of assists, lending support to his assertion that his prior mediocre performance was the result of poor health rather than apathy.[citation needed] Kewell scored his first league goal at Anfield in over two years when Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur 1\u20130 in January,[43] he was also the only scorer when Liverpool beat Manchester City 1\u20130 at Anfield[44] and scored the last goal in a 3\u20131 win over derby rivals Everton just under a month later.[45] Kewell was also one of Liverpool's best performers in the FA Cup semi-final win over Chelsea which Liverpool won 2\u20131.[46]\n\nKewell played in the 2006 FA Cup final, only to be substituted in the 48th minute due to abdominal pains (the supporters reaction this time was more sympathetic compared to the previous year's Champions League final). It was later confirmed by Liverpool that he had torn a groin muscle,[47] but was expected to be fit for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.[48]\n\nOn 30 April 2007, Kewell made his comeback after almost a year out of club football. He came on as a 55th-minute substitute for Liverpool Reserves in a \"mini-derby\" against Everton Reserves.[49] On 5 May 2007, he came on as a substitute in the second half of Liverpool's match against Fulham at Craven Cottage, having not played for Liverpool since his substitution in the 2006 FA Cup final.[50] On 13 May 2007, Kewell came on as a substitute in the second half against Charlton Athletic in the last match of the Premier League season, where he scored his last ever goal for the club.[51] Speculation on whether he was to be selected in Liverpool's upcoming Champions League final in Athens rapidly became positive for Kewell after providing an excellent game against Charlton. Kewell provided a cross in for Dirk Kuyt to assist towards a Xabi Alonso goal and then scored a penalty on the 90th minute.[51] He played in the Champions League final in Athens, appearing as a second-half substitute for Boudewijn Zenden, however Liverpool lost the final 2\u20131 to Milan.[52]\n\nKewell was injured for the start of the 2007\u201308 season, and he faced an uncertain future at Liverpool having suffered yet another injury, which sidelined him for the first month of the Premier League season. Kewell returned as a substitute in Liverpool's League Cup victory over Cardiff City on 31 October, coming on in the 71st minute.[53] He then came on as a substitute in the Premier League and Champions League against Blackburn and Be\u015fikta\u015f respectively.[54][55] Kewell put in a great performance by setting up two goals for Fernando Torres and Dirk Kuyt as Liverpool beat Marseille in impressive fashion 4\u20130 away victory to secure qualification to the knockout phase of the Champions League. After his return, Liverpool manager Rafael Ben\u00edtez stated on the club's website and to other members of the media that a new contract for Kewell to continue his career at Anfield was not out of the question.[56] Many believed that if Kewell could stay injury free until the season's end he would be offered the chance to remain with the club.\n\nKewell found himself unable to make the team after Liverpool's FA Cup defeat to Barnsley. His chances of a new contract were hindered, however; when seeking games and match fitness, he travelled with his national team to play in a game against Singapore. Kewell returned to England with a groin strain,[57] unfortunately leaving less time to prove himself worthy of a new deal. His first goal of the 2007\u201308 season was for the Liverpool reserve team in their 2\u20130 win over rivals Manchester United.[58] Because of injuries, his future at Liverpool was uncertain.[59] In May 2008, it was revealed Liverpool would not be offering Kewell a new contract at the club.[60]\n\nOn 5 July 2008, reigning Turkish S\u00fcper Lig champions Galatasaray signed Kewell to a two-year contract, presenting him with the number 19 shirt.[61]\n\nUpon signing, Kewell said, \"I wanted to move on and this is the best way. I can't wait to get started, it's just what I'm looking forward to, a new challenge.\"[62] His transfer to Galatasaray provoked strong criticism from fans and teammates of his former club Leeds United as he was a Leeds player when two of their fans were murdered in attacks before a UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul in April 2000.[63][64] Kewell responded and in an open letter he stated, \"I chose the No 19 shirt when I signed for Galatasaray SK as a sign of respect for Leeds because that was the number I got when I first became a regular member of the Leeds United starting XI. I felt that it might be a way to demonstrate that I had not forgotten where it all started and I was hoping that in a small way it would help the healing process of the tragedy that occurred on 5 April 2000. To blame the Galatasaray club for the tragedy in Istanbul is simply wrong and discriminatory.\"[65][66][67]\n\nKewell made his debut for Galatasaray in the Turkish Super Cup where he came on as a substitute on the 66th minute, scoring his first goal for Galatasaray just 20 seconds later with his first touch in the 2\u20131 win over Kayserispor, while also providing the assist for the second goal.[68] His second goal for the club came in the first league match of the season against Denizlispor, which Galatasaray won 4\u20131.[69] On 23 October 2008, Kewell scored the only goal in Galatasaray's UEFA Cup win over Olympiacos.[70] One week later, Kewell played in Galatasaray's first Turkish Cup match where they drew 1\u20131 with Ankaraspor.[71]\n\nOn 2 November 2008, Kewell scored his fourth league goal in Galatasaray's home win over Gaziantepspor, after a week full of overwhelming speculations in the Turkish media about his injury.[72][73] Following medical consultations in Australia, it was announced on 12 December 2008 that Kewell would need surgery to repair an inguinal hernia,[74] and the operation took place on 15 December 2008.[75] Of the nine matches that Kewell had scored in before his injury, Galatasaray had won them all, including two UEFA Cup matches, six S\u00fcper Lig matches and a Turkish Super Cup match.\n\nIn a UEFA Cup round of 32 match against Bordeaux, Kewell scored a goal from 35 metres from goal,[76] bringing the score to 2\u20131. Galatasaray ended up winning the match and proceeding to the round of 16.[76] On 12 March 2009, during the UEFA Cup round of 16 match against Hamburger SV, Kewell had to play as a centre-back for 40 minutes after the sending off of teammate Emre A\u015f\u0131k, but managed to fulfill the role adequately despite playing out of position. In the second leg of the round of 16 clash, he was again played as a centre-back, scoring a penalty while doing so.[77]\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Kewell scored 14 goals in 28 matches in all competitions. He netted 9 times in 17 league appearances,[78] playing as the main striker in most matches due to an injured Milan Baro\u0161. In a 2009\u201310 Turkish Cup play-off, Kewell scored in a 2\u20131 win against Bucaspor on 28 October 2009 to put the side into the group stage phase of the tournament.[79] Finishing on top of their group, Galatasaray were eliminated at the quarter-final stage against Antalyaspor.[80] During the 2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds, Kewell scored Galatasaray's second goal in a 4\u20131 away win against Israeli club Maccabi Netanya on 30 July 2009.[81] Kewell would then score in a 5\u20130 win against Estonia's Levadia Tallinn on 20 August 2009.[82] Galatsaray qualified for the group stage phase. On 22 October 2009, Kewell scored in a 4\u20131 win over Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti in Istanbul.[83] In the return leg on 5 November 2009, he scored after 22 minutes in an eventual 3\u20130 Galatasaray victory.[84] Galatasaray faced Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the 2009\u201310 UEFA Europa League knockout phase where they lost 3\u20132 on aggregate to the eventual champions.[85]\n\nOn 15 August 2009, Kewell scored two penalties in a 4\u20131 home win to Denizlispor.[86] Almost two weeks later, on 31 August, he scored a goal after 74 minutes in a 2\u20130 away win to Ankaraspor on matchday 4 of the S\u00fcper Lig season.[87] Kewell scored his fourth goal of the campaign in a 4\u20133 win to Trabzonspor on 18 October.[88] Two weeks later, he scored in a 2\u20130 win to Sivasspor at home on 1 November.[89] By matchday 13, Kewell scored his sixth goal of the domestic season in a 1\u20131 draw to Manisaspor on 22 November.[90] Two weeks later, on 6 December, he scored after 56 minutes in a 1\u20131 draw to \u0130stanbul B\u015eB.[91] Just five days later, in an away game against Antalyaspor, the game was locked at 2\u20132 until after 67 minutes Kewell broke the deadlock to win the match for Galatasaray 3\u20132 on 11 December.[92] On 19 December, Kewell would score his ninth and final goal for Galatasaray in the 2009\u201310 season in a 1\u20130 win to Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi, where he netted on the 77-minute.[93] In January, fellow Socceroo teammate and captain Lucas Neill would join Kewell at Galatasaray after he was transferred from Everton.[94] Under coach Frank Rijkaard, Galatasaray finished third on the 2010\u201311 S\u00fcper Lig table, thereby qualifying for the 2010\u201311 Europa League third qualifying round, where Kewell's contract with Galatasaray expired after the 2009\u201310 season.[95]\n\nOn 16 July 2010, it was revealed that Kewell had rejected an approach from A-League side Gold Coast United in favour of staying in Europe.[96] Galatasaray offered a new one-year contract, but it is believed that Kewell preferred a longer-term contract.[96] On 19 July 2010, Galatasaray announced via its official website that the parties had agreed to a one-year extension of Kewell's contract.[97] On 21 July, the details of Kewell's contract were revealed: he would receive a lump sum fee of \u20ac1.8\u00a0million and a salary of \u20ac30,000 per match.[98] It was also revealed that Kewell would wear number 99 for the 2010\u201311 season.[99][100] Kewell scored his first goal of the 2010\u201311 season in a 1\u20130 win against Gaziantepspor on 14 September 2010.[101] Kewell scored his second goal of the season against Be\u015fikta\u015f in a 2\u20131 loss on 29 November; having been down 2\u20130, Kewell scored for Galatasary after 90 minutes.[102] Kewell opened the scoring after 27 minutes as Galatasary beat Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa 3\u20130 on 5 December 2010.[103]\n\nOn 7 February 2011, Kewell scored Galatasaray's third goal in a 4\u20132 win against Eski\u015fehirspor, he was substituted off the field after 63 minutes for Milan Baro\u0161, who would then score Galatasaray's fourth goal.[104] Following a solid but not sensational season at Galatasaray, there had been continual speculation that Kewell could be heading back home to Australia, with the Newcastle Jets reportedly a keen investor. The interest in the Socceroo coincided with Nathan Tinkler buying out the Novocastrian club in late 2010. Kewell scored his last goal for Galatasaray in a 3\u20132 away win against Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi on 15 May 2011.[105] On 19 May 2011, Kewell's wife, Sheree Murphy, posted on Twitter that Harry would play his last game for Galatasary against Konyaspor because no contract had been offered to him.[106] Galatasaray finished in eighth spot on the S\u00fcper Lig table with 46 points, as Kewell scored 5 goals in 20 appearances for the 2010\u201311 season.[107]\n\nKewell was a fan favourite among Galatasaray supporters; his working discipline and dignified personality were appreciated by his teammates and board members in Galatasaray as well. He was described as fully professional with a charming character, always smiling and dedicated to his family.[108] His nicknames at Galatasaray were \"B\u00fcy\u00fcc\u00fc Harry\", meaning \"Harry the Wizard\" (inspired by Harry Potter) and the \"Wizard of Oz\" (Turkish: \"Oz B\u00fcy\u00fcc\u00fcs\u00fc\").\n\nOn 20 August 2011, it was announced Kewell had signed a three-year contract with A-League club Melbourne Victory.[109][110][111] Melbourne was hyped up with \"Kewell Fever\" with many hundreds of fans welcoming him at Melbourne Airport and over two thousand fans attending AAMI Park, where he was given his number 22 jersey by chairman Anthony Di Pietro. Kewell played his first friendly against Adelaide United on 23 August at Hindmarsh Stadium, coming off at half-time. Coach Mehmet Durakovic rated his performance as \"phenomenal\" and went on to say, \"Harry's really a professional footballer, and should be ready for 8 October.\"[112]\n\nKewell made his first appearance in the 2011\u201312 A-League season in a 0\u20130 draw against Sydney FC on 8 October in front of an attendance of 40,000 at Etihad Stadium.[113] Kewell scored his first goal for the Victory from a penalty against Gold Coast United on 26 November 2011 at AAMI Park, Melbourne, after teammate Archie Thompson was brought down in the box in the first minute. On 31 December 2011, at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, Kewell scored his second goal in the fourth minute from a cracking shot outside of the box. After a slow start to his debut A-League season, he started to get his talented form back, resulting in a few best on ground performances. His fourth goal came from a free-kick just outside the box against Gold Coast United in Launceston, Tasmania, on 1 February 2012. His goal, however, was not enough to seal the match, as Melbourne conceded a late goal in the last minute from Gold Coast's Michael Thwaite to end in a 1\u20131 draw.\n\nKewell scored his fifth goal against Central Coast Mariners on 10 February from a cracking volley in the box which helped Melbourne get a crucial 2\u20131 win over the top side. It allowed Melbourne Victory a hope of making the finals with six matches remaining. On 18 February, Kewell scored two goals at Suncorp Stadium to give Melbourne a hope of drawing against Brisbane Roar in a classic 3\u20132 loss. He was taken off in the 77-minute which resulted in Melbourne Victory having a few less chances of scoring. He has scored three goals from two matches at Suncorp Stadium. Kewell did not continue with the club after his first season and returned to Europe to be closer to his mother-in-law as she battled cancer.[114]\n\nOn 6 April 2013, Kewell signed to Al-Gharafa in the Qatar Stars League for the remainder of the 2012\u201313 season as an injury replacement for fellow Australian Mark Bresciano.[115] Kewell made his debut on 7 April as a substitute against Al Sadd.[116][117] Kewell finished his third and final game of the season in Qatar with his only goal, against Qatar SC on 18 April.[118] With the current terms of his contractual commitments to Al-Garafa completed, Kewell was seen back in Melbourne around 48 hours later,[119] with his future career uncertain.\n\nIn June 2013, it was announced that Kewell would play for Melbourne Heart in the 2013\u201314 A-League season.[120] Following the first match of the season against Melbourne Victory, Kewell was diagnosed with whiplash, ruling him out for three weeks. In training for his matchday 5 return, Kewell suffered an ankle injury.[121] On 26 March 2014, it was announced that Kewell would retire from professional football at the end of the A-League season. His last match was on 12 April 2014 against Western Sydney Wanderers.[122][123]\n\nOn 19 October 2016, it was announced that Kewell had been chosen as the recipient of the Alex Tobin Medal, Australia's most prestigious football honour, for his achievements during the course of his career.[124]\n\nKewell became the third youngest player to debut for the Australia national team when he played against Chile on 24 April 1996, aged 17 years and 7 months.[125][126][127][128]\n\nIn November 1997, Kewell was selected to play for Australia in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Iran. At the Azadi Stadium in Tehran, in front of an estimated crowd of 100,000, Kewell scored his first ever goal for his country and gave Australia a 1\u20130 lead. Iran eventually drew level and the game resulted in a 1\u20131 draw, which set up a tense return game in Melbourne.\n\nA then-record crowd for a football match in Australia of 85,513[129] \u2013 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground \u2013  witnessed the second leg of the World Cup qualifier against Iran, as well as Kewell's second goal.[130] The Socceroos eventually stretched their lead to two goals but Iran fought back and scored two vital away goals to finish the game 2\u20132 and qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France[130] on away goals.\n\nA few months after failing to qualify for the World Cup, Kewell joined Australia as it competed in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup. After advancing past the groups stage Australia faced Uruguay in the semi-final. Kewell scored the decisive goal two minutes into extra time with a golden goal, immediately giving Australia a 1\u20130 victory. Australia then faced Brazil in the final, losing 6\u20130.[131]\n\nKewell joined Australia as they faced Uruguay in both legs of the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC\u2013CONMEBOL play-off). In the first leg that was played in Melbourne, Australia led Uruguay 1\u20130. However, Uruguay pulled away with a 3\u20130 win in Montevideo. This meant Kewell and Australia spent another World Cup on the sidelines.[132]\n\nIn February 2003, Australia made headlines by upsetting England. Kewell scored Australia's second goal of the match that ended 3\u20131.[133] Later that year Kewell once again added to his goal scoring record against Jamaica in a 2\u20131 win.[134]\n\nKewell featured in the final of the 2004 OFC Nations Cup. He featured in the second leg of the final against Solomon Islands, scoring in the 8th minute of the first half. Australia would go on to win the leg 5\u20130, with an overall record of 11-1 after both legs.[135]\n\nOn 16 November 2005, Australia qualified for the 2006 World Cup after they defeated Uruguay.[136][137] It was the first time Australia had qualified for the World Cup since 1974 when it was held in West Germany. Kewell was considered instrumental in the Socceroos' defeat of Uruguay, turning the course of the match after he came on as a substitute. After just over half an hour in the first half, a flicked pass on the left wing from Mark Viduka opened up a chance for Kewell, who then scuffed the kick. However the ball fell perfectly for Mark Bresciano who went on to score the equalizer.[138] Kewell also scored the first penalty for Australia in the deciding penalty shoot-out, which they went on to win 4\u20132.[136][137]\n\nKewell played in Australia's opening game of the 2006 World Cup against Japan in Kaiserslautern. He did not start for Australia in their second group match against Brazil, but again came on as a substitute, missing an early opportunity when Brazilian goalkeeper Dida punched the ball out dangerously. Kewell was reported to FIFA by referee Markus Merk for verbal abuse after the match but he escaped being sanctioned.[139]\n\nKewell scored Australia's second goal in the 79th minute against Croatia to equal the score at 2\u20132 and qualify for the round of 16 for the first time.[140] Australia only needed a draw to qualify for the round of 16. He was also awarded Man of the Match for his performance,[140] which made him the second Australian to win the Man of the Match award at a World Cup after Tim Cahill who had won the award earlier in the tournament for his performance against Japan.[141] Due to suspected gout,[142][143] (later diagnosed as septic arthritis \u2013 a bacterial infection in the joints of his left foot[144]) Kewell was unable to play against Italy in the knockout stage, which Australia lost 1\u20130 and saw Australia eliminated from the tournament.[145]\n\nKewell did not play for the national team for a year following the World Cup, and made his national-team comeback in a friendly against Singapore on 30 June 2007. The match was Australia's last before the 2007 Asian Cup and Kewell came on as a substitute in the 65th minute, scoring his eighth international goal and providing a cross for the final goal in a 3\u20130 victory.[146][147] Kewell was a key part of the Australian squad for their first Asian Cup. Kewell scored his ninth international goal for Australia in a 4\u20130 win over Thailand in the Asian Cup.[148] After the group stage, in the quarter-final against Japan, Kewell was sent on to the pitch to replace Mark Viduka in the 61st minute, in a 1\u20131 draw. A penalty shootout was required to break the deadlock and Kewell's first penalty shot for Australia was stopped. Australia ultimately lost the shootout and were eliminated from the competition.[149]\n\nKewell did not play either of Australia's first two matches against Qatar and China. Kewell was made captain for Australia's qualifier against Iraq at Suncorp Stadium on 1 June 2008. He scored the only goal with a header in the 47th minute as Australia won 1\u20130.[150] Kewell also scored the third goal against Qatar in Australia's 3\u20131 win to put them into the final qualification round.[151] In a World Cup qualifier warm-up match against the Netherlands, he scored a penalty won by Joshua Kennedy.[152] Australia went on to win 2\u20131 with Kewell playing a vital part for the national team in the first half.[152] Australia then played Uzbekistan, winning 2\u20130 with Kewell scoring a penalty.[153]\n\nKewell did not play in Australia's opening game of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, a 4\u20130 loss to Germany.[154][155] After the loss, Kewell said that the morale of the team remained high, ahead of a clash against Ghana. During the match against Ghana on 19 June, Kewell was sent off for blocking a goal by handling the ball.[156] Standing on the goal line, Kewell attempted to block the ball from entering the goal net with his chest, however the ball ricocheted off his arm; he received a straight red card for the offence on the 24-minute. Asamoah Gyan went on to score the resulting penalty and the game was drawn 1\u20131,[156][157] severely damaging Australia's hopes of progressing past the group stage. This was the 150th red card issued in a World Cup match.[158] Kewell denied rumours that he was behind a supposed rift in the Socceroos camp.[159] After the match, Kewell said that he was devastated by the decision made by referee Roberto Rosetti and felt that the red card \"killed\" his World Cup dream.[160][161]\n\nKewell started in all of the Socceroos' matches in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, scoring three times for the green and gold in the Qatar-based tournament.[162] His first goal came in Australia's first match, against India,[163] with a left-footed shot from outside the penalty area. Kewell's second goal came in Australia's quarter-final match against Iraq with a header in the 118th minute in extra-time, which gave Australia a 1\u20130 win and put them into the semi-finals of the Asian Cup for the first time in Australia's history.[164] Kewell continued his fine form in the semi-final against Uzbekistan by opening the scoring in the first five minutes, helping his side to a 6\u20130 win and progress to the final,[165] where they were beaten 1\u20130 by Japan.[166]\n\nIn February 2012, Kewell scored his last goal for Australia in a 4\u20132 win over Saudi Arabia in Melbourne.[167] He played his final game for Australia against Oman on 8 June 2012, the game finished 0\u20130.[168]\n\nFollowing his retirement, Kewell worked with junior players through his academy in Australia for a few months, and in 2015 he successfully completed his UEFA B and A licenses.[169]\n\nOn 23 July 2015, Kewell was appointed head coach of the Watford Under-21 team.[170][171] On 10 August 2015, Kewell coached his first game for the club, ending in a 0\u20130 draw at Sheffield Wednesday.[169]\n\nOn 23 May 2017, Kewell was appointed head coach of League Two club Crawley Town,[172] becoming the first Australian to coach a professional English side.[173] Warren Feeney  was appointed assistant manager to Kewell.[174] Kewell's managerial debut on 5 August was a 3\u20131 home loss to Port Vale.[175] Kewell guided Crawley Town to a 14th place finish in League Two, with his most successful spell consisting of 10 league wins in 14 league games between 9 December 2017 and 17 February 2018. Kewell left Crawley Town after six games into the 2018\u201319 season to take over at Notts County with Crawley 14th in League Two. \n\nOn 31 August 2018, Kewell was appointed manager of fellow League Two club Notts County,[176] being officially announced three days later, becoming the club's fifteenth permanent manager in 10 years, with the club sitting bottom of League Two.[177] On 13 November 2018, he was sacked after 11 league games in charge; he had won three and the team were in 22nd place, just above the relegation zone.[178]\n\nOn 1 August 2020, Kewell was appointed as manager of Oldham Athletic on a one-year contract with the option to extend for a further year. He became their fifth manager in the last 12 months.[179]\nHe oversaw a poor first full month in charge with the side going six games without a victory in October, later achieving a record of 11 wins, 6 draws and 15 defeats for a 32% win rate.\n\nOn 7 March 2021, it was announced by Oldham Athletic that Kewell, and his assistant, Alan Maybury, had been relieved of his duties as manager.[180] Kewell left Oldham with the club in 16th place in League Two, above their position in the previous season.\n\nOn 10 June 2021, Kewell was appointed the new head coach of Barnet in the National League, becoming the club's 26th manager in 10 seasons.[181] On his debut on 21 August, his side lost 5\u20130 at home to his former club Notts County.[182] He was dismissed on 20 September, having lost five and drawn two of his seven games.[183]\n\nOn 18 June 2022, Kewell joined Scottish Premiership title holders Celtic as a first-team coach, under compatriot manager Ange Postecoglou.[184]\n\nKewell was born in Smithfield, Sydney. He is married to English soap actress Sheree Murphy, whom he met at the Majestyk nightclub in Leeds in 2000.[185] The couple married in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 24 May 2002[186] and have four children.\n\nAs of May 2008, Kewell became the face of Australian men's fashion brand Politix.[187] He advocated the introduction of Western Sydney A-League expansion team Sydney Rovers, having grown up in Smithfield in Sydney's west. He is also a supporter of Australian rugby league club Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs of the National Rugby League.[188]\n\nLeeds United\n\nLiverpool[193]\n\nGalatasaray[193]\n\nAustralia U17\n\nAustralia U20\n\nAustralia\n\nIndividual\n\nOrders\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kewell"}, {"id": 182, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/37/735684/original/cillian-sheridan-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Cillian Sheridan", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/cillian-sheridan/735684", "desc": "Cillian Sheridan (born 23 February 1989) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ironi Kiryat Shmona.\nSheridan began his career with Celtic in 2006, but a lack of first team opportunities saw him being loaned to other Scottish clubs.

In 2010, he switched clubs and countries joining CSKA Sofia of Bulgaria, from where he was loaned to Scottish side St Johnstone in 2011. After playing for Kilmarnock between 2012 and 2013, he signed for defending Cypriot champions APOEL. In both his seasons with the club, he won the double. Subsequently, he moved to rivals Omonia.\n\nHe earned three international caps for the Republic of Ireland in 2010.\n\nBorn in Bailieborough, County Cavan,[1] Sheridan grew up playing Gaelic football for Bailieboro Shamrocks.[3] He began playing the association code with Bailieboro Celtic before travelling to Dublin to play for Belvedere, where he received call-ups for Irish youth squads.[4] During his time at Belvedere, Sheridan chose to focus on his football career, having turned down an offer to join Australian rules club Brisbane Lions.[5][6] He had trials with several clubs before being offered a contract by Scottish Premier League club Celtic, which he accepted.[5]\n\nAfter joining Celtic in the summer of 2006, Sheridan was promoted to the reserve team and then the first team squad during his first season at the club, a \"spectacular rise\" according to coach Joe McBride.[7]\n\nHe made his first team debut for Celtic in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 25 February 2007, as a 73rd-minute substitute for Mark Wilson in a 2\u20131 away victory.[8] He signed a new three-year contract with the club two days later.[9] On 20 May 2007, the final game of the season, he made his league debut against Hibernian, playing the final two minutes of a 2\u20131 defeat at Easter Road in place of Craig Beattie.[10] Sheridan made his European debut on 21 October 2008, coming on as a substitute for Scott McDonald in Celtic's Champions League game against Manchester United at Old Trafford.[11] He also started in the return game at Celtic Park on 5 November 2008, a 1\u20131 draw.[12] Just four days after his European debut, Sheridan made his first league start against Hibernian, scoring the second goal of a 4\u20132 win.[13]\n\nOn 2 February 2009 Sheridan signed for Motherwell on loan until the end of the season, to replace Chris Porter, who had signed for Derby County the previous day.[14] He made his debut five days later, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1\u20131 draw with St Mirren in the Scottish Cup.[15] He made his first start and league debut a week later on Valentine's Day in Motherwell's 1\u20130 win over Hamilton, playing the entire 90 minutes as his strike partner David Clarkson scored the only goal of the game.[16] Sheridan scored his first league goal for The Well a fortnight later, the winner in a 2\u20131 victory at Inverness.[17][18] His only other goal for Motherwell came near the end of the season in a 3\u20130 win over Hamilton.[17]\n\nOn 13 August 2009, Sheridan joined Plymouth Argyle on a six-month loan deal.[19] He made his debut in a 1\u20131 draw against Queens Park Rangers.[20][21] He played 14 times for the Championship team but failed to find the net.[22]\n\nSheridan completed his loan spell at Plymouth and returned to Celtic on 14 January 2010. Later the same day he was again loaned out, this time to St Johnstone for the rest of the season.[23] On his debut, on 17 February, he scored two goals in a 5\u20131 win against Hibernian.[24] On 30 March he scored the opening goal for St Johnstone in a 4\u20131 win over Rangers.[25]\n\nSheridan signed a three-year contract with Bulgarian club CSKA Sofia on 13 August 2010.[26] Sheridan made his debut in the 2\u20132 draw against League of Wales side The New Saints; CSKA won 5\u20132 on aggregate.[27] He scored his first goal for the club in their 3\u20131 away win against Sliven.[28] On 25 September, Sheridan scored twice in a 2\u20130 win against Montana.[29] Changes of management, however, made it difficult for Sheridan to settle in Bulgaria.[30]\n\nOn 7 June 2011, Sheridan appeared in a reserve match for American side Seattle Sounders FC.[31] Sheridan started the game and scored in the 7th minute of a 2\u20130 victory over Vancouver Whitecaps FC.[32] Following his spell with Seattle, Sheridan went on trial with their major rivals Portland Timbers, appearing for their reserve team.[33][34] On 8 July, Sheridan joined SPL club Hibernian on trial,[30] but instead decided to return to St Johnstone on a loan deal until January 2012.[35] He made his second St Johnstone debut on 23 July against Aberdeen,[36] and scored his first two goals of his second stint with the club against Hearts on 25 September.[37] Sheridan scored four goals in 15 appearances before he was prevented from playing by a hamstring injury.[38] In January 2012 St Johnstone and CSKA Sofia agreed to extend the loan deal until the end of the season.[39]\n\nAfter being released by CSKA Sofia, due to the club's financial problems, Sheridan signed a two-year contract with Scottish Premier League side Kilmarnock on 6 September 2012.[40][41] Sheridan made his debut in a 2\u20131 loss against Hibernian on 15 September 2012.[42] Seven days later on 22 September 2012, he scored his first goal when he opened the scoring in a 3\u20131 win over St Mirren.[43] The following week, he scored a hat trick at Tynecastle in 3\u20131 victory over Hearts. After the match, teammate Manuel Pascali compared Sheridan comparison to former Kilmarnock striker Conor Sammon[44] On 17 October 2012, Sheridan scored against his former club Celtic in a 2\u20130 win at Parkhead.[45] Sheridan continued his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, but then suffered a hamstring injury which ruled him out for several weeks.[46] During Sheridan's injury absence Kilmarnock signed Kris Boyd, and even after recovering from injury, Sheridan struggled to regain his first team place.[47]\n\nOn 20 June 2013, Sheridan signed a one-year contract, with the option of a further season with APOEL from Cyprus.[48][49] He made his official debut on 17 August 2013 against Apollon Limassol in the Cypriot Super Cup final, in a match which APOEL won 1\u20130 and lifted the trophy.[50][51] He scored his first official goal for APOEL on 7 December 2013, in his team's 2\u20130 away win against Ethnikos Achna for the Cypriot First Division.[52] On 8 January 2014, he scored the only goal in APOEL's 1\u20130 home victory against AEL Limassol for that season's Cypriot Cup.[53] On 5 February 2014, he gave his team the three important points after scoring the winning goal against Anorthosis in APOEL's 2\u20131 away win.[54] On 29 March 2014, he scored the second goal of the match against Apollon Limassol, in APOEL's 3\u20130 home win for the Cypriot First Division play-offs.[55] On 21 May 2014, Sheridan scored APOEL's second goal in the Cypriot Cup final against Ermis Aradippou and helped his team to lift the trophy after a 2\u20130 win.[56][57] On 31 May 2014, Sheridan gave APOEL their 23rd Cypriot First Division title after scoring the only goal in the title decider match against AEL Limassol.[58][59]\n\nOn 30 July 2014, Sheridan scored the equalizer against HJK Helsinki at Sonera Stadium, in APOEL's 2\u20132 first leg draw for the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League.[60] One week later, he scored again in the return leg against HJK Helsinki, opening the scoring in APOEL's 2\u20130 home victory and advancement to the play-off round of the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League.[61] On 26 August 2014, he scored the fourth goal in APOEL's 4\u20130 triumph over Aalborg BK for the UEFA Champions League play-off round, helping his team to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League.[62] Sheridan appeared in every group stage match in APOEL's 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League campaign.[63] On 25 May 2015, one day after winning his second consecutive double with APOEL, the team announced that Sheridan was leaving the club as his contract would not be renewed.[64]\n\nOn 10 June 2015, Sheridan signed a contract with rival Cypriot club Omonia.[65] He made his debut on 9 July in the second leg of the Europa League first round qualifying tie against Dinamo Batumi, helping his side to a 2\u20131 aggregate win.[66] His first goal for his new club came on 23 July in the second leg of the next round qualifying tie against Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok, the only goal in a 1\u20130 win which saw his side qualify for the third qualifying round.[67] He then scored two penalties on 6 August in a 2\u20132 draw with Br\u00f8ndby in the Europa League third qualifying round second leg, but his team were eliminated on away goals.[68]\n\nSheridan played his first league match for Omonia on 22 August 2016 at home against Nea Salamis. He levelled the match at 1\u20131 after 20 minutes, then helped his side come back from 3\u20131 down to win 5\u20133, scoring Omonia's fifth goal from the penalty spot in injury time.[69] Sheridan went on to enjoy the most prolific season of his career to date, scoring a total of 15 goals in the league to add to the three he scored early in the season in the Europa League qualifying rounds.[70]\n\nOn 28 February 2017, Sheridan signed a two and half-year contract, with Jagiellonia from Poland.[71][72]\n\nIn January 2019, Sheridan signed with Wellington Phoenix who play in the Australian A-League until the end of the 2018\u201319 A-League season.[73]\n\nOn 5 July 2019, Sheridan signed for the Israeli Premier League club Ironi Kiryat Shmona.[74]\n\nOn 2 February 2020, Sheridan signed for Ekstraklasa club Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock.\n\nOn 19 July 2021, after a trial period with the club, Sheridan would make his return to Scottish football by signing a two-year deal with Scottish Premiership side Dundee.[75] He would make his debut in a Scottish League Cup win over Forfar Athletic.[76] On 30 October in an away win against St Mirren, Sheridan suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon, which kept him out of action for the remainder of the season.[77][78]\n\nAfter playing his first competitive minutes in nearly a full year in an SPFL Reserve League match against Kilmarnock the previous week,[79] Sheridan made his first team return for Dundee in a Scottish Challenge Cup victory away to Welsh champions The New Saints, in which Sheridan would be credited with the opening goal, his first for the Dark Blues.[80] On 8 February 2023, Sheridan would suffer yet more injury heartbreak, as his other Achilles tendon ruptured during a Challenge Cup game against Raith Rovers.[81]\n\nSheridan has been capped for the Republic of Ireland national under-17 football team, scoring in the 2005 Nordic Under-17 Football Championship win over England.[82]\n\nHe also line up for the Republic of Ireland under-21, making his debut for the team, in a friendly match, against Germany U21.[83] He appeared in the 2011 UEFA U\u201321 qualifiers.[84] He scored his first goal in the seventh minute of a match against Estonia U21, on the virtue of which, the match ended in a draw.[85] He went on to play a total of 10 times for the side, finding the net twice.[86]\n\nOn 25 May 2010, Sheridan won his first cap for the Republic of Ireland in a 2\u20131 friendly win against Paraguay at the RDS Arena, as a 62nd-minute substitute for Robbie Keane.[87] Three days later, he featured as a 72nd-minute substitute for Kevin Doyle as the Irish defeated Algeria 3\u20130 at the same ground.[88] His final of three caps was his only start, playing 56 minutes of a 1\u20130 defeat to Argentina at the Aviva Stadium on 11 August before being withdrawn for Andy Keogh.[89]\n\nRepublic of Ireland U17\n\nCSKA Sofia\n\nAPOEL\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Sheridan"}, {"id": 183, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/76/1516515/original/marcus-bent-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Marcus Bent", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/marcus-bent/1516515", "desc": "Marcus Nathan Bent (born 19 May 1978) is an English former footballer who played as a striker.

A former England under-21 international, the journeyman striker played 573 games and scored 113 goals for fourteen different clubs. His numerous transfer fees totalled over \u00a310 million.\n\nHe began his career at Brentford in 1995, before he signed with Crystal Palace in 1998, where he made his Premier League debut. The next year he joined Sheffield United via Port Vale. In 2000, he transferred to Blackburn Rovers, before he moved on to Ipswich Town in 2001. He spent 2003\u201304 on loan at Leicester City, before he transferred to Everton in 2004.\n\nTwo years later he was sold on to Charlton Athletic. He spent the 2007\u201308 season on loan at Wigan Athletic, before he moved on to Birmingham City in 2008. He spent three years with Birmingham, during which he spent time on loan at Middlesbrough, Queens Park Rangers, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Sheffield United. After leaving the club he spent six months in Indonesia with Mitra Kukar. After five years out of the game, during which time he faced legal issues, he then had brief spells in non-league football with Wick and Cornard United.\n\nBent graduated through the Brentford youth ranks, usually playing as a forward. He broke into the first team at Griffin Park in 1995\u201396 under manager David Webb, helping the Bees to a 15th-place finish in the Second Division. Bent was almost ever-present in a successful season that saw Brentford reach the play-offs in 1996\u201397 with a fourth-place finish. He played at Wembley in the play-off Final defeat to Crewe Alexandra, and was substituted after 70 minutes for Scott Canham. Bent then scored five goals in 29 games in 1997\u201398, as the Bees struggled in vain to avoid relegation under Eddie May and then his replacement Micky Adams.\n\nThough not a prolific striker for Brentford, Bent's potential was spotted by Crystal Palace manager Steve Coppell, who brought Bent to Selhurst Park for \u00a3300,000 on 8 January 1998.[3] The Eagles were relegated out of the Premier League in last place in 1997\u201398, though Bent had shown his ability with five goals in 16 games, including strikes at Stamford Bridge and Anfield. However, he remained goalless in 15 appearances in 1998\u201399, as Palace struggled under new boss Terry Venables. With the club heading for administration,[5] he was sold on to First Division rivals Port Vale for \u00a3300,000 on 15 January 1999, as one of long-term manager John Rudge's last purchases.[3]\n\nRudge was unable to make the most of his new player, as chairman Bill Bell controversially sacked Rudge and hired Brian Horton. Played out of position on the left-wing, Bent went 15 games without a goal for the Valiants in 1998\u201399. He played nine games in 1999\u20132000, scoring once against Grimsby Town in a 3\u20131 win at Vale Park.[6] In October 1999, he was sold on to league rivals Sheffield United for \u00a3375,000, with Bell eager to cash in on the \u00a375,000 profit. He later described moving from Crystal Palace to Port Vale as \"my dream blown up in my face\" as he struggled to adapt to life outside London, referring to the culture shock he said \"Someone said 'All right, Duck', which put me on my toes. I thought, 'Why are you calling me Duck?'[7]\n\nBent became the Blades top scorer in 1999\u20132000 with 15 league goals in 32 appearances, including a hat-trick past West Bromwich Albion in a 6\u20130 thrashing at Bramall Lane on 19 February. The club had struggled under Adrian Heath, before finding an upturn in results after Neil Warnock stepped into the hot-seat in December. He began the 2000\u201301 campaign in fine form, hitting a hat-trick past Lincoln City in a 6\u20131 win in the League Cup. He was reportedly targeted by former club Crystal Palace for a swap deal of Clinton Morrison and \u00a31.5 million; however manager Alan Smith denied that he had made any such offer.[8][9] He was instead sold to promotion chasing Blackburn Rovers for \u00a32 million in November 2000; the transfer was seen as good business for both clubs.[10]\n\nBent scored his first goal for Rovers against bitter East Lancashire rivals Burnley in a 2\u20130 win at Turf Moor on 17 December 2000.[11] He went on to hit 11 goals in 34 appearances in 2000\u201301, justifying Graeme Souness's fee, as the Ewood Park club won promotion back to the Premier League. He made ten goalless appearances in 2001\u201302, before he was sold on to Ipswich Town for \u00a33 million in November 2001,[12] which was Town's fourth biggest transfer fee behind teammates Matteo Sereni, Hermann Hrei\u00f0arsson, and Finidi George.\n\n\"His goalscoring form has proved the \u00a33m fee for Bent from Blackburn is money very well spent. It's no coincidence that Ipswich's change in form has followed him signing for them. His speed, pace and eye for goal have tormented some of the Premiership's best defences.\"\nDespite Bent scoring nine times in 22 league starts,[14] the Blues were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2001\u201302 season. He stayed at Portman Road for the 2002\u201303 campaign, hitting 12 goals in 38 games, as the Tractor Boys missed out on the play-offs by one place and four points. However Ipswich entered administration, and were forced to sell talent such as Marcus Stewart, Titus Bramble, and Darren Ambrose; a relegation battle was only avoided after manager George Burley was replaced by Joe Royle. Ipswich then found another striking talent, Darren Bent (no relation), and Bent joined newly promoted Premier League side Leicester City on loan for the 2003\u201304 campaign, in a move that reunited him with manager Micky Adams. Bent scored ten goals in 35 games, though the First Division beckoned for the Foxes, as the Walkers Stadium outfit finished six points behind 17th place Everton.\n\nUnable to afford his \u00a317,000-per-week contract, in June 2004, Ipswich sold Bent to Everton for a fee of \u00a3450,000; the Toffees manager David Moyes said that \"he's got athleticism, he's quick, good in the air\".[15] He became a regular starter at Goodison Park in the lone centre forward role (supported by Tim Cahill), but only managed seven goals in 2004\u201305, which were key in securing draws away to Southampton and at home to Aston Villa, as well as decisive goals against Middlesbrough and Manchester City. Despite having helped the club to secure a place in the Champions League, Bent became a more peripheral figure in 2005\u201306, having lost his first team place to James Beattie.\n\nIn January 2006, it was announced that Bent had signed for Charlton Athletic in a deal worth \u00a32.3 million.[16] He scored on his debut as a substitute against Premier League champions Chelsea in a 1\u20131 draw. Bent hit only two goals in 35 games in 2006\u201307, 13 fewer than strike partner Darren Bent, who had signed with Charlton from Ipswich. The club had collapsed following the departure of manager Alan Curbishley after his fifteen-year reign, and First Division football returned to The Valley despite the best efforts of Iain Dowie, Les Reed and Alan Pardew.\n\nBent joined Wigan Athletic on Transfer Deadline Day (31 August 2007) on a season-long loan move, one of nine summer signings by boss Chris Hutchings.[17] However, after a poor start to the campaign, Hutchings was replaced by Steve Bruce. Bent scored a hat-trick, his first in the Premier League, against former club Blackburn Rovers in a 5\u20133 win, on 15 December; Roque Santa Cruz also scored a hat-trick in the game, the first time in the Premier League that two opposing players scored hat-tricks in the same match. Despite only hitting seven goals in 32 games, he still became the Latics's top scorer in 2007\u201308. At the end of the season, Wigan manager Steve Bruce chose not to make the deal permanent, feeling Bent was too similar in style to Emile Heskey; Bent subsequently returned to cash-strapped Charlton, where he was placed on the transfer list.[18]\n\nBent signed a three-year deal for Birmingham City in July 2008 for a fee in excess of \u00a31\u00a0million,[19] after rejecting the opportunity to join Cardiff City.[20][21] He scored three goals from 16 starts and 17 substitute appearances as Alex McLeish got the club promoted to the Premier League with a second-place finish in 2008\u201309. He did not feature at the higher level for the Blues. Instead, he became Gordon Strachan's first signing for Middlesbrough when he joined on a two-month loan deal on 30 October 2009,[22] later extended to 16 January 2010. He spent the final three months of the 2009\u201310 season on loan at a second Championship club, Queens Park Rangers, whom he joined in February 2010.[23] Both clubs finished in mid-table, and Bent failed to find the net at either the Riverside Stadium or Loftus Road.\n\nStill out of the first team plans at St Andrew's, he again moved on loan in August 2010, as he joined Mick McCarthy's Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers until 4 January 2011.[24] He made five appearances without scoring, before joining Sheffield United on loan until the end of the 2010\u201311 season, teaming up with Micky Adams at a third different club.[25] With the Blades in free-fall Bent made ten appearances, mainly from the bench, before returning early to Birmingham in mid-April having failed to score a goal.[26] Birmingham decided against taking up the option of another season, and Bent was released when his contract expired at the end of the 2010\u201311 season.[27]\n\nBent signed a one-year contract with Indonesia Super League club Mitra Kukar on 3 November 2011.[28] In doing so he rejected interest from clubs in England, choosing the Far East as he \"didn't want to be based up north\".[29] He was released on 17 April 2012, with the club in mid-table.[30]\n\nOn 13 September 2017, now aged 39, Bent signed a one-year contract with Southern Combination League Premier Division club Wick; club chairman Rodney Lampton said he and Bent had been childhood friends.[31] However, Bent left the club without making an appearance.[32] On 3 January 2020, he joined Eastern Counties League First Division North club Cornard United.[33]\n\nBent represented his England at under-21 level in May 1998, in games against South Africa and Argentina.[34]\n\nBent was born in Hammersmith, London,[2] to parents of Jamaican origin.[35] Prior to signing a scholarship with Brentford in 1994, he was named Marcus Lecky.[36] He has a younger brother, Elliott, who is ten years his junior and is also a footballer. Elliott was a youth team player at Fulham, until injury saw him released in 2007.[37] He dropped into non-league football and has played for Dorchester Town, Welling United and Hampton & Richmond Borough.\n\nBent had been engaged to Kelly Clark, with whom he has a daughter, but their relationship broke down and they split up. He has since been involved with model Danielle Lloyd[38] and actress Gemma Atkinson, to whom he was briefly engaged.[39] After his playing career ended, Bent entered the oil business.[40] However he left the industry and his life went into a steep decline as he struggled with mental health problems, using drugs to self medicate.[41]\n\nHe was charged with affray and possession of a Class A drug in September 2015 after police used a taser whilst arresting him at his home in Esher, Surrey.[42] He had called 999 after believing intruders were in his house, but was tasered by police responding to the call.[43] In February 2016 he admitted to one charge of affray and possession of cocaine; he was given a suspended 12-month prison sentence, a two-month curfew and 200 hours of compulsory unpaid work.[44] Four months later he was fined \u00a3385 with \u00a385 costs after being found with cocaine at Chessington World of Adventures.[45] He was declared bankrupt in January 2019.[46]\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nBirmingham City\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Bent"}, {"id": 184, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/54/1062083/original/georgios-samaras-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Georgios Samaras", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/georgios-samaras/1062083", "desc": "Georgios Samaras (Greek: \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2, pronounced [\u02c8\u029dor\u0263os sama\u02c8ras], born 21 February 1985) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a winger or a striker, most recently playing for Turkish club Samsunspor.\nSamaras started his career at OFI Crete, before moving on to Eredivisie side Heerenveen in 2001.

After Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson took over as  manager Samaras fell out of favour with the first team. In January 2008 he was loaned out to Scottish Premier League team Celtic, moving on a permanent basis in the summer.\n\nSamaras helped Celtic win Scottish league championships in 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014, totalling 74 goals in 249 competitive games. He left the club at the end of his contract in 2014 and returned to the Premier League with West Bromwich Albion, where he featured rarely and had an unsuccessful loan to Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia. In March 2016, he joined North American Soccer League expansion team Rayo OKC, and when they shut down after one season he signed for Real Zaragoza.\n\nAlthough eligible to play for Australia, because his father Ioannis Samaras was born in Melbourne, Samaras chose to represent his country of birth, Greece. He made his debut in 2006, and became a regular over the next eight years, earning 81 caps and scoring 9 goals. He represented his country at Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.\n\nSamaras was born in Heraklion, the capital city of the Greek island of Crete[1] to  a Melbourne-born father who had settled back in Greece before Georgios' birth.[3] His grandfather, also called Georgios, was from Arnaia[4] and was also one of the founders of Australian side South Melbourne FC.\n\nHis favourite footballer growing up was Marco van Basten. Samaras was also a keen basketball fan and his father, Ioannis Samaras, often let him stay up until the early hours of the morning so he could watch his hero Michael Jordan.[5]\n\nIn 1994, when he was 10 years old, Samaras joined his boyhood heroes, OFI Crete.[6] His father was playing for them at the time and then retired in 1996. Six months later, he became Academy chief manager, a position he retained until 2000, when he became manager. Samaras credits his father highly with helping start his football career. His influence meant that Samaras trained every day of his childhood and he also got to spend a lot of time behind the scenes at OFI. Samaras left for Eredivisie club Heerenveen in 2001.[7]\n\nSamaras broke into the Heerenveen team during the 2002\u201303 season, still aged only 18. He scored three goals in his first four appearances, all of which were from the bench.[8] This form prompted Heerenveen activate a three-year extension clause in his contract.[9]\n\nSamaras' first goal of the 2003\u201304 season came, on 25 October, in a shock 2\u20131 loss for Heerenveen against NEC Nijmegen.[10] On 3 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen beat ADO Den Haag 2\u20130.[11] His next goal came 10 days later as he scored an equaliser to secure a draw 1\u20131 for Heerenveen against RBC Roosendaal.[12] He then scored on 20 December, as Heerenveen beat Roda JC 2\u20131.[13]\n\nSamaras' first goal of the 2004\u201305 season came on 11 September, in a 2\u20130 win over De Graafschap.[14] He then scored a last-minute winner on 3 October, as Heerenveen secure all three points against ADO Den Haag.[15] On 28 November, Samaras scored one of Heerenveen's goals as they staged a late comeback against title-chasing Feyenoord, and secured a 2\u20132 draw.[16] He then scored on 22 January, as Heerenveen, who were performing very well in the Eredivisie, beat Den Bosch 2\u20131.[17] On 12 March, Samaras scored an equaliser against RKC Waalwijk, but Heerenveen then conceded a late goal and fell to a 2\u20131 defeat.[18] On 2 April, Samaras scored to help Heerenveen secure a shock 2\u20131 victory over Ajax.[19] A fortnight later, Samaras scored the equaliser as Heerenveen came from behind to beat Vitesse Arnhem 3\u20131. This win moved Heerenveen up to fifth in the table.[20] In the next match Samaras, along with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, scored a hat-trick as relegation candidates RBC Roosendaal were defeated 7\u20131 and Heerenveen pushed to finish the league in a European spot.[21]\n\nAt the start of the 2005\u201306 season, Sevilla were reported to be interested in Samaras as a replacement for J\u00falio Baptista.[22] While Arsenal were also looking at him after they had missed out on signing Baptista, some news organisations had reported that Arsenal had already signed Samaras and that he would join at the end of the season. However, the player's father, Ioannis Samaras said that this was untrue and that his son wanted to stay at the club for another year.[23] Samaras scored on the opening day of the season, on 20 August, when he helped Heerenveen to a 5\u20134 victory over Roda JC.[24] He picked up a minor leg injury in September, which ruled him out of Heerenveen's UEFA Cup tie against Ban\u00edk Ostrava.[25] But he returned to action on 23 September, and scored as Heerenveen beat NEC Nijmegen 2\u20131.[26] On 14 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen came back from behind to beat Levski Sofia 2\u20131 in the UEFA Cup.[27] On 30 December, Samaras scored twice as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4\u20132.[28] In January 2006, Arsenal and Manchester City showed interest in signing the striker.[29] Samaras tried to get released from his contract after Heerenveen had rejected a bid from Manchester City. However, the Dutch arbitration commission ruled that he had no grounds to end his contract.[30] Samaras scored 25 goals in 88 appearances for Heerenveen.[31]\n\nSamaras moved to Manchester City on 30 January 2006 for a fee of \u00a36\u00a0million,[32] a record for a Greek player. He was given the number 20 shirt.[33] Samaras made his debut for City on 1 February, as a 65th-minute replacement for Cole in a 3\u20130 home win against Newcastle United.[34] His first goal for the club came in the following home match, against Charlton Athletic.[35] The following month Samaras scored in a 2\u20131 home win against Aston Villa, to put City through to the quarter-finals of the League Cup. This was his fourth goal in six appearances.[36] Samaras scored one further goal that season, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.[37]\n\nSamaras' first goal of the 2006\u201307 season came on 20 September, despite this, City lost 2\u20131 in the League Cup to League One side Chesterfield.[38] Four days later, Samaras scored twice, as Manchester City beat West Ham United 2\u20130. City had won just three of their previous 16 games, and the club, as well as Samaras, had been receiving a lot of criticism from fans.[39]\nOn 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2\u20131.[40]\n\nIn March, the Daily Mirror reported that the reason Manchester City were struggling so badly was that they didn't have any quality strikers. They went on say that the \u00a36\u00a0million spent on Samaras looked like \"very bad business\" especially compared to the \u00a32.5\u00a0million Blackburn Rovers had spent on Benni McCarthy. They also described Samaras as looking like a \"fish out of water\" as he struggled to adapt to the different style of play in England.[41] On 10 March, defender Richard Dunne said that he felt the reason that City were performing so badly was that their foreign players, including Samaras, were letting the side down by not working hard enough. Samaras responded to his criticisms, by saying that he felt it was Pearce's fault that he wasn't playing well because the manager wasn't giving him a regular run of games. He also said that he felt a lot of criticism stemmed from his high transfer fee, saying that it is normal for expensive players to be criticised more than most when they don't play well. Samaras also said that he had come through tougher periods than this and his self-belief would not be shaken, he said that his desire was to become a Champions League player.\n\nSven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson took over from Pearce for the 2007\u201308 season and, following a spending spree, Samaras was reportedly deemed surplus to requirements by the new manager. Samaras' agent Paul Koutsoliakos said that, despite interest from across Europe, his client wanted to stay in the Premier League and prove his ability.[42] Samaras was linked with a \u00a32.5\u00a0million move to Middlesbrough towards the end of the transfer window but ended up staying at City.[43] Eriksson stated that although he was unimpressed with Samaras when he first joined, he felt the player had improved and adapted his style of play a lot during pre-season and that he now felt comfortable keeping him at the club.[44]\nSamaras had been widely criticised, and even booed, by City fans at times during the previous season and Eriksson said that he hoped it would not happen again and that he appreciated why Samaras could have found it hard to play under those circumstances. Samaras was behind the likes of Valeri Bojinov and Rolando Bianchi in the pecking order and was included in the squad for the first time only on 25 September, when he was selected for a League Cup match against Norwich City. He started the match and scored a last-minute winner to put Manchester City into the quarter-final.[45]\n\nBy the time the January transfer window came, Eriksson had decided to sell Samaras, amongst others, to try and raise funds for the club.[46] Birmingham City had chased him for several weeks and had a \u00a32.5\u00a0million offer accepted, meeting Manchester City's valuation of the player, but they pulled out of the deal with a week of the transfer window remaining.[47] Several teams including Rangers, Middlesbrough, Espanyol, Bolton Wanderers and Charlton Athletic had expressed an interest in signing him, but it was Celtic to whom he eventually moved.[48][49]\n\nSamaras failed to get a regular place in the first team over the two years he was at Manchester City. Mainly used as a substitute, he scored 12 goals in 63 appearances for the Eastlands club.[50]\n\nOn 29 January 2008, Samaras signed for Scottish Premier League club Celtic on a six-month loan deal, with the club having an option to buy him at the end of his loan spell. He said that he wanted the move because he needed to be playing first team football to get into the Greece squad for Euro 2008. He also said that he was attracted to the fact that he would regularly be able to play in European competition with Celtic.[48][49]\n\nSamaras was given the number 9 shirt and made his debut on 4 February, in a 5\u20131 win in the Scottish Cup over Kilmarnock. He scored the final goal of the game after coming on as a substitute.[51] On 20 February, he came on as a substitute in Celtic's 3\u20132 defeat to Barcelona, this was his first ever Champions League match.[52] A week later he scored the winner in a 2\u20131 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle to help Celtic keep up the pressure on league leaders Rangers.[53] He then scored in Celtic's next match, a 2\u20130 win over Hibernian, after coming on as a substitute.[54] Samaras' next goal came on 23 March, he again came on as a substitute and rounded off the scoring in a 3\u20130 win over Gretna.[55] On 19 April, he scored the only goal of the game as Celtic beat Aberdeen 1\u20130, and moved to the top of the league for the first time in 2008.[56] The next month, on 3 May, Samaras again came on as a substitute and scored the winner. His goal gave Celtic a 2\u20131 victory over Motherwell and kept up Celtic's late challenge for the league title.[57] Celtic won the title on the last day of the season, 22 May, by beating Dundee United 1\u20130. Samaras came on as a late substitute and collected his first winners' medal after the match.[58]\n\nSamaras' contribution in the second half of the season proved vital to Celtic winning the title, he scored several important goals which kept alive Celtic's faltering title hopes.[59] His signing was also credited with reviving the previously underperforming Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink.[51]\n\nAfter his successful loan spell,[60] Samaras left Manchester City on 15 July 2008 and signed a three-year contract with Celtic.[61] Although the fee was not disclosed, it was reported to be between \u00a31\u00a0million and \u00a33\u00a0million.[62][63][64][65] Samaras' first goals of the 2008\u201309 season came on 23 August. He scored twice as Celtic beat Falkirk 3\u20130.[66] On 13 September, he scored another two goals as Celtic beat Motherwell 4\u20132.[67] He scored twice again in Celtic's next match as they beat Kilmarnock 3\u20131.[68] He then scored another two goals as Celtic beat Livingston 4\u20130 and advanced to the League Cup quarter-final.[69] He was named SPL Player of the Month for September, at this point he was also the top scorer with seven goals.[70]\n\nSamaras suffered a knee cartilage injury in mid-October, after a successful operation he was expected to be out for a month. This meant he would be likely to miss crucial Champions League ties against Manchester United and Aalborg.[71] He returned earlier than expected and was back in training on 9 November, having missed seven games.[72] Samaras returned to action on 12 November, coming on as a substitute in a 3\u20130 win over Kilmarnock.[73] On 25 November he started against Aalborg but did not play well and missed several chances as Celtic lost 2\u20131. This loss consigned Celtic to a bottom place finish in their group.[74]\n\nHis first goals of the new year came on, on 4 January, as he scored twice against Dundee United. However, this was not enough for a victory and the match finished 2\u20132.[75] Although he did not start in the League Cup Final due to poor form,[76] he did come on as a substitute as Celtic beat Rangers 2\u20130 and won the trophy.[77] Samaras scored twice on 4 April, as Celtic beat Hamilton Academical 4\u20130.[78] Celtic lost the title on the last day of the season.[79] Samaras scored 17 goals,[50] with 15 of them coming in the SPL. This made him the third top scorer behind Kris Boyd and team mate Scott McDonald.[80]\n\nCeltic manager Gordon Strachan left at the end of the season and was replaced by Tony Mowbray.[81] On 5 August, Samaras scored in injury time of Celtic's Champions League third qualifying round tie against Dynamo Moscow. This goal won Celtic the tie, 2\u20131 on aggregate, and helped them to their first European away win in six years.[82] Celtic then drew English Premier League club Arsenal, but lost 5\u20131 on aggregate and subsequently dropped into the Europa League.[83] On 13 December, Samaras scored in Celtic's 3\u20132 win over Motherwell, this was his fifth goal in the club's previous four matches.[84] He scored in Celtic's 2\u20131 defeat against Hearts on 19 December. This left Celtic four points behind rivals Rangers going into Christmas.[85] From February onwards, Samaras was mainly played out of position on the left of midfield.[86]\n\nCeltic endured a dismal season, culminating in a humiliating 2\u20130 loss to lower league Ross County in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.[87]  Samaras missed a chance to equalise in that match when the score was only 1\u20130 to County,[87] and he was amongst several players publicly criticised by caretaker manager Neil Lennon.[88]  Samaras finished the season with 10 league goals and 12 in all competitions.[50]\n\nSamaras began the 2010\u201311 season in good form, scoring his first goal in a Europa League tie against FC Utrecht with a chest down and finish to make it 2\u20130, sending Celtic into the second leg with a lead.[89] On 22 September 2010, he scored a hat-trick in a 6\u20130 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the League Cup.[90]  However, the goals then dried up with Samaras failing to score again in 2010.[91]\n\nHe then produced a match-winning performance against Rangers at Ibrox on 2 January 2011.[92][93] He was selected as a lone striker[94] and scored both Celtic goals in a 2\u20130 victory.[95] His first goal came from latching onto a Joe Ledley pass before rounding Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and slotting home from a wide angle.[95][96] His second came after he won a penalty which he converted to secure the victory.[95] His efforts in this game won him Goal.com's World Player of the Week Award.[97] In the following game, a Scottish Cup tie against Berwick Rangers, Samaras again started but failed to last the 90 minutes after sustaining a hamstring injury.[98] Samaras had an influential performance in a 3\u20130 home victory against Rangers in the SPL on 20 February, helping to set up the second goal for Gary Hooper[99] and causing problems for the opposition throughout the game.[100]\n\nOn 16 March, Samaras captained Celtic for the first time in a 2\u20131 Scottish Cup win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle at the Caledonian Stadium.[101][102] Two days later, he signed a new deal to keep him at Parkhead until the summer of 2014.[103]  Celtic drew 0\u20130 with Rangers on 24 April 2011 in the final Old Firm league fixture of the season, with Samaras missing a penalty kick late in the second half.[104]  The draw kept Rangers one point ahead of Celtic in the league, and the Ibrox club went on to win the league by one point despite Celtic's emphatic 4\u20130 win over Motherwell in the final league game of the season (Samaras scoring Celtic's second goal in that game).[105]  Samaras did end the season with silverware though, playing a week later in Celtic's 3\u20130 win over Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final.[106]\n\nOn 3 November 2011, Samaras started against Rennes in a Europa League match at Celtic Park. Celtic won the match 3\u20131 with Samaras getting two assists. He drew plaudits for his much noticed work-rate and determination during the match.[107] Samaras then started the next match against Motherwell in the SPL and set up another goal for Anthony Stokes, Celtic went on to win the match 2\u20131 after being 1\u20130 down.[108] Samaras went on to score his first goal of the 2011\u201312 season in a 5\u20130 win over St Mirren. Manager Neil Lennon said that; \"He got his goal, which we've been waiting on a long time. His play was fantastic. He is a talent and all we are asking for is consistency. He has shown everyone today what he is capable of when he is in full flow. The rest took a leaf from his book.\"[109] After an impressive performance in Celtic's 1\u20131 draw against Italian league leaders Udinese,[110] fellow Serie A side Palermo expressed an interest in Samaras. He had been playing as a left midfielder in the previous few weeks, and the Daily Record said that his good form since returning to the team had helped re-ignite Celtic's season.[111] On 24 December, Samaras started as a striker and scored twice as Celtic beat Kilmarnock 2\u20131.[112]\n\nOn 8 August, Samaras scored his 50th Celtic goal in the 2\u20130 away victory over HJK Helsinki in the second leg of the Champions League third qualifying round.[113] On 21 August, Samaras assisted Kris Commons' opening goal in the Champions League play-off round first leg away at Helsingborgs and then scored himself later in the match.[114]  He scored a dramatic late winner in a 2\u20133 win against Spartak Moscow in the Champions League group stage.[115]\nSamaras became the first player in Celtic history to score in five consecutive away matches in Europe,[116] with headed goals in 2\u20131 defeats to Barcelona and Benfica adding to his goals against Spartak Moscow, Helsingborgs and HJK Helsinki.[117] Samaras is also credited for helping Celtic qualify from the group stage, providing the assist for Hooper's opening goal in the final game against Spartak at Parkhead and then winning the foul for the penalty that Commons converted to clinch the win required that night.[118]\n\nSamaras scored an overhead kick in a 2\u20130 win at Dundee on Boxing Day 2012.[119] In March 2013, Samaras was substituted on as Aberdeen led Celtic 3\u20131 at Celtic Park, and his overhead kick completed the comeback as he made it 4\u20133 in the 94th minute of the match.[120]\n\nOver the course of the season, Samaras captained Celtic on several occasions, including the opening league match against Aberdeen and also in the away leg of Celtic's last-16 Champions League tie against Juventus.[117]  Samaras finished the season with more silverware as Celtic clinched their second successive league title and then defeated Hibs 3\u20130 in the Scottish Cup Final. Samaras did not start, however was subbed on later in the match, replacing Kris Commons in the 76th minute.[121]\n\nSamaras started the 2013\u201314 season with a goal against NIFL Premiership club Cliftonville in the Champions League second qualifying round,[122] and made it two goals in two matches as he scored in the return leg with a header in a 2\u20130 victory. Celtic won the tie 5\u20130 on aggregate.[123] Celtic knocked out Elfsborg in the next round,[124] before playing Shakhter Karagandy in the final qualifying round. Trailing 2\u20130 from the first leg away in Kazakhstan,[125] they rallied in the return match at Parkhead.  Samaras scored early in the second half, adding to Commons' goal just before half time, to level the tie on aggregate.  A last minute goal from James Forrest clinched the aggregate win and saw the club once again progress to the group stages.[126]  Samaras played in all six group games, but only scored once, away against Barcelona in a 6\u20131 defeat.[127]  He continued to feature regularly in domestic games for Celtic, but was often used as a substitute.[128]  He scored a hat-trick on 28 September away against Kilmarnock in a 5\u20132 win.[129]  Samaras only scored another three league goals after that,[130] including a goal from a penalty kick in his final appearance for the club on 11 May 2014, a 3\u20131 win at home against Dundee United.[131]\n\nThe same day, Samaras confirmed that Celtic would not offer him a new deal when his current contract expired at the end of the season, leaving him as a free agent.[132]\n\nOn 22 August 2014, Samaras completed a free transfer move to English Premier League side West Bromwich Albion on a two-year contract.[133]  He failed to secure a regular place in the team and by January 2015 had made only eight substitute appearances, all without scoring.[134]\n\nOn 5 February 2015, Samaras joined Saudi side Al-Hilal on loan for the rest of the season, with an option to sign him permanently at the end of his loan spell.[135]  He played  against Al-Ahli in the Saudi Crown Prince Cup Final eight days later, but despite scoring his first goal for his new team, they lost 2\u20131.[136]  His next goal came in the first round of the Kings Cup on 10 March 2015, netting his side's fourth goal in a 4\u20131 win over Al-Jeel.[137]\n\nOn 20 March 2015, Samaras faced a hip injury, the most serious injury in his career that forced him to be out of action for almost three months. In April 2015, Greek newspaper SportDay reported that Samaras was unhappy with life in the Middle East and did not wish to continue his career at the Saudi club when his contract expired at the end of the season.  It was also reported that Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon were keen to sign him.[138]\n\nSamaras had his contract with West Brom terminated by mutual consent on 17 July 2015.[139]\n\nIn August 2015, Samaras was reported to have agreed terms with Serie A club Sampdoria, but the move fell through as the club were unhappy with the results of his medical.[140][141] Afterwards, he spent time in New York to rehabilitate from a back injury, and in November 2015 was linked with a move to the New York Cosmos,[142] although once again no move actually materialised.[143]\n\nSamaras did eventually sign for a North American Soccer League team, joining expansion side Rayo OKC on 10 March 2016.[144] On 2 April, he made his debut in their first match, replacing Robbie Findley for the final 12 minutes of a goalless home draw against FC Edmonton.[145] He was the last of three of the team's players sent off on 28 May in a 1\u20130 loss at Soccer Bowl holders the Cosmos.[146] Samaras' first goal for the franchise came on 16 July in his 9th match, coming on as a late substitute to wrap up a 3\u20130 win over the same opponent at the Miller Stadium.[147]\n\nSamaras became a free agent in early 2017 when Rayo OKC shut down after only one season, and his next move was suggested to be to Spain to sign for Real Zaragoza.[148] On 8 February, he was unveiled at a press conference and assigned the number 5 shirt.[149]\n\nOn 6 August 2017, Samaras agreed terms with TFF First League club Samsunspor.[150][151] On 24 December he scored his first goal with the club, equalising at the end of the first half, in a 4\u20132 away loss against \u00dcmraniyespor. It was his first goal since 7 August 2016 when he scored in a 1\u20131 draw against the New York Cosmos.[152][153]\n\nSamaras was eligible to play for the Australian national team. His father, Ioannis, was born in Melbourne, but moved to Greece at the age of 13, and had a successful football career, playing for OFI Crete, Panathinaikos, and Greece.[154] Additionally, his grandfather (also Georgios) was one of the founding members of South Melbourne FC. Although Samaras considered playing for Australia, he was never approached by Football Federation Australia and chose to play for the country of his birth.[155]\n\nHe made his debut for Greece just a week after his 21st birthday, on 28 February 2006, in a friendly game against Belarus, in which he scored the sole goal of the game.[156] He featured in Greece's Euro 2008 qualifiers and was a member of the unsuccessful Greek squad at the finals,[154] making just one appearance as a second-half substitute in their first UEFA Euro 2008 Group D game against Sweden.[157]\n\nSamaras' fourth international goal was a crucial one, when he scored the winning goal in a 2010 World Cup qualifier against Israel in front of his hometown crowd in Heraklion.[158] He scored his fifth international goal with an overhead kick in a World Cup qualifier on 10 October 2009, against Latvia in a 5\u20132 victory.[159]  Samaras also played against Ukraine in a World Cup Qualifying play-off, setting up the sole goal of the tie, passing to Dimitris Salpingidis who slotted home to give Greece a 1\u20130 win and a place in the 2010 World Cup Finals matches.[160]\n\nOn 1 June 2010, Georgios Samaras was selected in the 23-man Greece squad for the World Cup.[161] ESPN.com rated him as Greece's second best player, only behind talisman Giorgos Karagounis.[162] He played in all three group matches.[154] Despite Greece's 2\u20131 win over Nigeria, they failed to proceed to the knockout stage, due to 2\u20130 losses to both South Korea and Argentina.[163]\nOn 17 November 2010, Samaras scored his sixth international goal in a friendly against Austria in Vienna with Greece winning the match 2\u20131.[164] Samaras also set up Greece's second goal.[164]\n\nSamaras then went on to score a vital goal for Greece against Croatia on 7 October 2011, a volley from the edge of the box with his left foot. The match finished 2\u20130 and the result meant that Greece qualified for the Euro 2012.[165]  Samaras played in all three of Greece's group games at Euro 2012, helping them to finish second in Group A and progress to the quarter-finals.[166] He then played in the quarter-final tie against Germany, scoring early in the second half to level the match at 1\u20131, although Germany went on to win 4\u20132 and knock Greece out.[167]\n\nSamaras was selected in Greece's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the team's final group stage fixture, Samaras assisted Greece's first goal and scored the winning goal from a penalty kick in the 90th minute to give the team a 2\u20131 win over the Ivory Coast and qualify Greece for the last 16 of the World Cup for the first time in the nation's history.[168]\n\nSamaras has been described as having all the skills necessary for forward play.[169] His height, 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m), made him difficult to handle in the air \u2013 and he was also a good header of the ball. This meant he could be used as an effective target man and his team could hit long balls up to him. He could also score from corners and crosses. Samaras was also strong which further added to his physical presence and made him harder for defenders to play against.[44]\n\nSamaras was also a good dribbler.[170] This was due to his skill, quick feet and agility. He used this to his advantage and often went on runs where he beat several opposition players. However, he sometimes held onto the ball for too long and got tackled.[171] As well as his dribbling ability, he was quick which meant he could beat players with his pace. He could also use his strength to beat players as well and was also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players.[94][162] While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.[44]\n\nAlthough predominantly a striker, Samaras could also play as a left midfielder. In addition to being able to play as a target man, Samaras was also able to be utilised in several different roles when playing up front. His natural style of play was to drift off the front line and provide a link between the attack and midfield. In doing this he was able to use his pace and skill to run at the defence, while also creating chances or opening up space for his teammates.[162][170] He was also able to run beyond the centre-backs and his pace meant he could run on to through balls hit over the defence.[94]\n\nDespite his ability, Samaras performed inconsistently throughout his career. His mazy runs often went nowhere and he frequently got caught in possession when a pass to a team-mate was available.  His languid manner exacerbated supporters' frustrations and often led to accusations of him being \"lazy\".[169][172][173][174][175]\n\n\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Samaras"}, {"id": 185, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/70/1390954/original/kostas-katsouranis-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Kostas Katsouranis", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/kostas-katsouranis/1390954", "desc": "Konstantinos \"Kostas\" Katsouranis - Cazzo (Greek: \u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \"\u039a\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2\" \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2; born 21 June 1979) is a former Greek professional footballer.

A versatile midfielder, who won the Super League Greek Footballer of the Year Award in 2005 and 2013, as well as the Cosme Dami\u00e3o Award for Footballer of the Year in 2008.[1]\n\nKatsouranis qualified with the Greece national football team for international play between 2002 and 2015. They won the Euro 2004, and played in the Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup, Euro 2012 and 2014 World Cup tournaments. With 116 appearances, he is a member of a close club of players who had more than 100 caps in the history of the Greece national team.\n\nKatsouranis was not even 17 years old when he debuted in 1996 for the Patras-based club Panachaiki. In his first season, Panachaiki reached the Greek Cup semi-finals, tying an all-time best result in the competition. In the following season, Katsouranis made three appearances in the Intertoto Cup, scoring one goal as Panachaiki finished fourth out of five in their group. He spent six seasons in Patras and by the third, he was a regular.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, when his contract with Panachaiki expired, Katsouranis opened negotiations with Panathinaikos. Fernando Santos however, Panathinaikos' coach at the time, decided to sign Portuguese Carlos Cha\u00ednho, a player he knew when at Porto, which meant Katsouranis' transfer would not be finalized. Katsouranis was then approached by Olympiacos. The talks with the vice-president of the club, Giorgos Louvaris, seemed final, but Louvaris asked Katsouranis to wait until the president, Sokratis Kokkalis, returned from a business trip to the United States for the final negotiations. However, former AEK Athens president Chrysostomos Psomiadis took advantage of the situation and convinced the promising midfielder to sign a three-year contract with AEK Athens.[2]\n\nComing off the bench and making an impressive debut for the club, Katsouranis immediately became an integral part of the club. His continuing progress in the top-level rapidly made him one of the team's best players with great performances, both domestically and internationally. He was used mainly as a central midfielder but also can be used in the wings. In his first season, alongside his teammate in the national team, Thodoris Zagorakis he formed an amazing \"duo\" in the midfield of AEK.[3] In fact, he had an excellent performance in the UEFA Champions League group stage matches of that season and also scored a historic goal against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium.[4] He also scored the winning goal against Olympiacos in Rizoupoli Stadium at the stoppage time.[5]\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Katsouranis remained at AEK, despite several offers, having agreed a new three-year contract, while most of his teammates from the previous campaign had acted on their frustration and left. In the fevered atmosphere that saw AEK's gates quadruple as fans flocked to support the club under new president and former player, Demis Nikolaidis, Katsouranis adopted a special place in supporters' hearts.[6] That season would prove to be one of Katsouranis' greatest seasons with the club, as he scored 10 times in 28 appearances despite playing in the midfield, leading the club for the title race, while he was voted as the best Greek footballer of the championship. AEK managed to finish third despite the big cut in the team's budget. Werder Bremen expressed strong interest for the Greek international, but both Katsouranis and Nikolaidis decided to reject the offer.[7]\n\nDespite radical changes to the squad in the first season under Nikolaidis, players, fans and club staff came together to create an electrified atmosphere at every AEK game. Led by captain Katsouranis, the team responded with great performances, only missing the championship on the final day of the campaign. Everyone connected with the club was united for one purpose: the team, said Katsouranis. First we had to make the club financially healthy, and then to make sure everything was well organised.[2]\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, Katsouranis led the club to a second-place finish in the league, which brought them to the UEFA Champions League. At the end of the season, Santos was sacked and Katsouranis wanted to play to a bigger club and further his career abroad. He was signed by Benfica for a fee of \u20ac2.3 million plus the proceeds of friendly match in Athens between the two clubs.[8]\n\nKatsouranis signed a four-year contract with Portuguese club Benfica on 22 June 2006, joining his former manager Fernando Santos and his teammate with Greece, Giorgos Karagounis. When he arrived in June, he said \"Even if Fernando Santos or Karagounis were not here, I still would have joined. Benfica to me is one of Europe's top clubs and they proved that in the UEFA Champions League. I am here to achieve that same objective and joining Benfica can also help my international career.\"\n\nIn his first Cl\u00e1ssico against Porto, he followed on to score for Benfica with a header following a corner kick, the second goal he has scored for Benfica in the league in just a few matches. Katsouranis quickly became a key player for Benfica, scoring some important goals and also captaining the team on a few occasions. He proved to be one of the most important imports into the 2006\u201307 Portuguese Liga, playing in 29 league matches and scoring six goals.\n\nDespite interest from Valencia, Werder Bremen, Tottenham, and Juventus, Benfica refused to sell the player, despite Juventus willing to trade Tiago for the Greek international. Benfica were reluctant to sell and, on 14 September 2007, Katsouranis agreed to a contract extension with Benfica for another two years. During his last season there, he was given a chance to captain the side, which was a huge honour.[9] On 2 March 2009, Katsouranis was named \"Benfica Player of the Year\".[10]\n\nKatsouranis returned to Greece and signed a four-year contract with Panathinaikos, on 1 July 2009 on a fee of \u20ac3.5 million.[11] He has stated that it's the team he supported since childhood.  He scored his first goal against Sparta Prague for the Champions League. He scored his first league goal against Skoda Xanthi on the 2nd matchday of the 2009\u201310 season. Katsouranis scoring abilities were a key part of Panathinaikos' good run during the first half of the season, as the defensive midfielder scored 8 goals in just half a season. In his first season with Panathinaikos, he managed to win the domestic double with the 2009\u201310 Greek Cup final against Aris Thessaloniki. Katsouranis was the team's second top scorer behind Djibril Ciss\u00e9 with eight goals in the Super League Greece triumph.[12]\n\nIn October 2012, Panathinaikos president Giannis Alafouzos terminated his contract with the club, with Katsouranis paying the price for team's bad performances at the start of the 2012\u201313 season.[13] Katsouranis has been serving a six-match suspension for verbally abusing a referee in a Greek Super League match in August. Alafouzos reportedly told the rest of the squad that the player was \"history\" at Panathinaikos, whilst also expressing his displeasure about \"two or three other(s)\", without going into specifics.[14] Katsouranis left Panathinaikos with rumours for a lot of problems with foreign players and the accusation of controlling the changing rooms. Katsouranis never replied to a series of miseries which were released and related to him.\n\nOn 11 December 2012 he agreed with PAOK, not only because he wanted to prove that it can be helpful to club plans to become a champion, but also because he wanted to make it clear that working with people who trust him and with a serious administration, he will never be a problem for those who want to hide in the seatbacks and ask severe criticism. He succeeded in both. In fact few people know that he went to PAOK without the blessing of his former coach Giorgos Donis and needed only a few weeks to become one of his favourites.[15] Katsouranis would get \u20ac700,000 for a year and a half, plus any bonuses. It formed part of the policy of the new PAOK owner, Ivan Savvidis, who insisted on the acquisition of Greek internationals in order to boost both the strength of the roster and the prestige of the club.[16]\n\nHe made his debut with his new club on 6 January 2013 against Panthrakikos. On 24 January, he scored his first goal with PAOK in the cup against Kallithea. On 3 March 2013 Katsouranis scored his first goal in the Greek Super League with PAOK in a 4\u20132 win against Panionios. He formed a strong partnership with Gordon Schildenfeld in the defence reducing to a great extent the goals which PAOK conceded. On 27 August 2013 Katsouranis scored against Schalke 04 in the Champions League playoff in a 2\u20133 loss.[17]\n\nIn the following season he was named vice-captain of the club behind Dimitris Salpingidis. He believed that PAOK needed time and patience to identify changes to a club that really tries to make a break with problematic situations and detach from stereotypical stories. He said, \"What I see is that there is a plan. The fact that acquires so many Greek international footballers, shows in itself that is aiming a target. The challenge is to remain faithful to it and not skewed along the way. I have lived the same with AEK in summer of 2004. Then was not given so much money to the extent that PAOK does by acquiring reputable players. Along the way in AEK made other things than those envisaged in the initial plan leading the team to tabefaction. This should avoid PAOK. To remain faithful to the plan is the key not to lose the opportunity to build something big.\"[18] On 27 February 2014, he was sent off in the 69th minute in a 3\u20130 UEFA Europa League loss against Benfica, and he received a standing ovation from the Benfica fans as he exited the field in recognition for the seasons he spent with Benfica.[19]\n\nOn 16 April 2014, in an episodic semi-final game for the cup, where fans of both Olympiacos and PAOK put the mental in monumental as they greeted their heroes with a ring of fire, he had a key role in helping PAOK eventually went through on away goals after a 1\u20130 win following a 2\u20131 defeat in the first leg in Athens. It was a tremendous game as the fans then use the pitch as a giant ashtray by throwing their flares onto the grass and set fire to one of the dug outs.[20] Five minutes before the end of the game for the sake of a ball he falling out with his team player in Greece, Giannis Maniatis leading to his drop-off from the game.[21][22]\n\nIn September he signed a contract with Pune City, the team of Bruno Cirillo and David Trezeguet coached by the Italian coach Franco Colomba.[23] Speaking on Kostas' arrival, Gaurav Modwel, CEO, FC Pune City said, \"We would like to extend our heartiest welcome to Kostas. Apart from being a great player, he is an amazing human being his passion for football, down to earth personality and desire to learn and share sets him apart. His vast experience as a midfielder shall bring great balance to the FC Pune City team.\"[24]\n\nKatsouranis became the first player and captain of this year's FIFA World Cup to feature in the ISL. He played the first mach with the new club against Delhi Dynamos who contained Alessandro Del Piero in an away draw which ended 0\u20130. In a match against FC Goa, Katsouranis scored his first goal for the club and put in a man of the match performance in a 2\u20130 home win. Kostas made a very impressive play along with the Dutchman John Goossens and scored a beautiful goal in the away match in Kolkata against Atl\u00e9tico de Kolkata with the final result of 1\u20133 in favour of Katsouranis's club. This goal was awarded as the goal of the ISL's first season.[25][26]\n\nEven though in its first season, the Indian league is far more exciting than many others across the world and at the same time possesses a number of world class players. One of them, Katsouranis, winner of the 2004 Euro, scored his fourth goal in the season, becoming the league's second top-scorer just beneath Brazilian international Elano.[27]\n\nOn 26 December 2014, he signed a six-month contract with Atromitos with an option to extend it by one year. Undoubtedly he was the most impressive transfer of this winter's window, the signing of former Greece skipper. \"I will give it all for Atromitos\", stated Katsouranis who in the first half of the season plied his trade in India, with remarkable success in that up and coming mini-league that lasts only a few months. The 35-year-old has made no secret of his aspiration to return to the national team, too, as former Greece manager Claudio Ranieri had not called him up for any of the five matches Greece played after the 2014 World Cup.[28][29]\nOn 3 January 2015, he played the first match with the new club at home against Kalloni. He signed for Atromitos in a six-month deal with an option for one year more, however, the Athens club decided not to keep Katsouranis in their squad ahead of next season.[30][31]\n\n\nOn 15 September 2015, Katsouranis signed with NPL Victoria club Heidelberg United on a one-match contract, with the option to extend it should they win their following FFA Cup match.[32][33][34] Heidelberg United coach George Katsakis summed it up by commenting: \"When you start to put things into perspective, he played for S.L. Benfica, all over the world, to come to the Olympic Village for Heidelberg, it's amazing.\"[35] \n\"Katsouranis is one of the best players I ever trained in my professional career\"\n\nFernando Santos about Katsouranis.[36]\n\nOn 29 September 2015, Katsouranis officially announced his retirement from professional football.[37]\n\nIn August 2016, after his retirement from professional football, has appointed as a Technical Director of Football League club Panachaiki.[38] On 28 November 2018, he resigned from the position.[39]\nFrom 2016 to 2018, he was giving Master Classes of Football at the Institute of Vocational Training (\u0399\u0395\u039a) \u201c\u0391\u039a\u039c\u0397\u201d, Athens (Greece) and \"\u0399\u03a0\u03a0\u039f\u039a\u03a1\u0391\u03a4\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3\", Athens (Greece)\n\nOn 14 November 2017, Katsouranis was appointed as Ambassador of the United Nations. The announcement stated: \"The European Champion and Technical Director of Panachaiki F.C. Kostas Katsouranis was delighted to participate in the information campaign on the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Sport and Athletes around the world play a very important role in achieving the Goals, Development, Peace and Human Rights. We like to thank Kostas Katsouranis for his participation and his substantial contribution to the success of their efforts.\"[40]\n\nFrom April 2021 to June 2021 (about 2.5 months), he was the sporting director of Greek club Niki Volos.[41][42]\n\nIn the TV season 2018/19 he participated as a Commentator in the Sports TV show Total Football on the OPEN TV Greek channel. During the 2021/22 season he started working as a commentator and analyst of the Greek Super League 1matches,  in the show of the YouTube channel \"Betarades\".\n\nKatsouranis made his international debut for Greece on 20 August 2003 against Sweden and scored his first goal against Kazakhstan in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier. Katsouranis was one of the key factors in Greece's triumph at UEFA Euro 2004, beating Portugal in his own \"home\" (Benfica's Est\u00e1dio da Luz) and, following Greece's success at the tournament. Forced his way into the starting XI after coming off the bench for the opening game of the tournament, he was an extremely important part of a three-man midfield that also included Theodoros Zagorakis and Angelos Basinas. It was in Portugal that Katsouranis really made a name for himself, delivering a string of consistent performances culminating with that famous final in Lisbon. Lifting the Henri Delaunay trophy represents the pinnacle of a national-team career that so far has never again reached the same heights.[43]\n\nKatsouranis was a regular for Greece in their unsuccessful 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. He believes that the worse moment of the Greece national team was the elimination from the 2006 World Cup, realizing his own percentage in this unsuccessful tournament in a game against Albania national football team.\n[44]\n\nKatsouranis became one of Greece's impact players in their UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers when he helped Greece consecutively qualify for the finals to defend their crown. Their UEFA Euro 2008 campaign resulted in poor fashion as Greece failed to pick up a point. Katsouranis has captained Greece on several occasions and was selected for his country in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Together with Angelos Charisteas, Giourkas Seitaridis, Georgios Karagounis, Kostas Chalkias who all participated in Greece's UEFA Euro 2004 triumph, he led Greece to its first win World Cup against Nigeria, 2\u20131.[45]\n\nOn 17 October 2012, Katsouranis reached a milestone on the international level as he made his 100th appearance in a Greece shirt. A 1\u20130 win over Slovakia in Bratislava certainly stole the headlines, but Katsouranis became the fourth Greece player to make a century of appearances for Greece just days after teammate Giorgos Karagounis set the sport record for all-over appearances.[46]\n\nKatsouranis's exceptional leader characteristics along with experience and the huge influence on the pitch saw him stand-in as captain for Greece at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, with the team's regular captain, the veteran Karagounis, restricted to substitute appearances at the age of 37.[47] On 19 June 2014, Katsouranis became the first Greek player in World Cup history to be shown a red card. He was dismissed in the 38th minute of the group match against Japan for committing two bookable offences.[48]\n\nAfter the draw for UEFA Euro 2016, Katsouranis stated that he was confident of reaching the finals due to a lack of \"powerhouses\" in their qualifying group. Katsouranis believes Greece face a tricky task to reach the tournament, which will be held in France, but believes the side are well prepared for the challenge. \"It's a good draw for us but we have to prove that on the pitch as well,\" he said. \"I believe we have what it takes to be among the final 24 teams. There are no powerhouses in our group, but there are dangerous rivals.\"[49] However, Greece would finish bottom of their qualifying group, winning just once, on the final matchday.\n\nKatsouranis could play in various positions, characteristic shared with Ruud Gullit as a result of the combination of his technique, speed and strength. He has been described as \"a reasonable goal threat despite being notionally a midfielder\".[50] A fine passer of the ball, Katsouranis was also strong in the air and has excellent positioning defensively. However, it was his natural attacking instinct that makes him such a valuable footballer, being able to ghost into the box with regularity despite usually playing in a deep-lying midfield role. Over his club career and at times for the national team, he proved to be a natural finisher, scoring a variety of goals and crucial ones at that. His ability to offer an attacking threat without compromising his defensive duties means he is the embodiment of a box-to-box midfielder.[43]\n\nBenfica\n\nPanathinaikos\n\nGreece\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostas_Katsouranis"}, {"id": 186, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/107/2121938/original/sunil-chetri-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Sunil Chhetri", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/sunil-chetri/2121938", "desc": "Sunil Chhetri (born 3 August 1984) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a striker or winger and captains both the Indian Super League side Bengaluru FC and the Indian national team.

He scored 6 goals in that tournament including a hat-trick against Gujarat. Delhi lost to Kerala in the quarter finals and he scored in that match too.[13] He signed for Major League Soccer side Kansas City Wizards in 2010, becoming the third player from the subcontinent of note to go abroad.[14] He returned to India's I-League where he played for Chirag United and Mohun Bagan before going back abroad, at Sporting CP of the Primeira Liga, where he played for the club's reserve side.[15]\n\nChhetri helped India win the 2007, 2009, and 2012 Nehru Cup, as well as the 2011, 2015, and 2021 SAFF Championship. He has also helped India win the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, which qualified them to their first AFC Asian Cup in 27 years,[16] scoring twice in the final tournament in 2011.[17] Chhetri has also been named AIFF Player of the Year a record seven times in 2007, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018\u201319 and 2021\u201322.[18][19]\n\nChhetri received the Arjuna Award in 2011 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Padma Shri award in 2019, India's fourth highest civilian award. In 2021, he received the Khel Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honor and became the first footballer to receive the award.[20]\n\nChhetri began his professional football journey with Mohun Bagan of the National Football League after playing with City Football Club of New Delhi.[12] After his first season with the club, the 2002\u201303 season, Chhetri had scored four goals[21] as Mohun Bagan finished in seventh place in the table.[22] The next season, Chhetri scored only two goals. The first came against Sporting Goa while the second came against Indian Bank as Mohun Bagan once again finished in the bottom half of the table, in ninth place.[23] Chhetri then once again scored only two goals during the 2004\u201305 season; this time Mohun Bagan finished eighth in the league and remained in the National Football League on goal difference.[24]\n\nIn 2005, Chhetri signed for JCT for the 2005\u201306 season.[12] During that season, Chhetri scored three goals. He scored twice against Salgaocar before the third came against Sporting Goa, as JCT finished the season that year in sixth place.[25] Meanwhile, in the Santosh Trophy, Chhetri scored two hat-tricks for Delhi in the group stages of the 61st Santosh Trophy against both Orissa and Railways.[26] However, despite Chhetri's best efforts, Delhi were eliminated in the pre-quarter final round after losing 1\u20130 to Tamil Nadu in extra time.[26]\n\nThen, during the 2006\u201307 season, Chhetri scored a total of twelve goals in the league for JCT as the club finished in second place, behind Dempo.[27] Among his best games during that season were the matches against his former club Mohun Bagan and Dempo in which he scored braces in both matches as JCT won both games 2\u20130 and 3\u20132 respectively.[28][29]\n\nThen, during the very first season of the I-League, Chhetri scored seven goals as JCT finished the season in third place.[30] His only brace that season came against Salgaocar during the final match of the season.[31] Midway through that season though, in December 2007, Chhetri was awarded the AIFF Player of the Year award for 2007 for his excellent form and performances for his club and country.[18]\n\n\"Of course, I would love to play in Europe like [David] Villa and it all depends where I get an offer from. England would certainly be fine and I have had talks but the stumbling blocks are the work permit restrictions.\"\n\nSunil Chhetri, stating his desire to move abroad to play alongside Spanish striker David Villa.[32] \n\nIn October 2008, it was rumored that Chhetri had sparked interest from foreign clubs. These clubs were Leeds United of the Football League One and Estoril Praia of the Liga de Honra, the second division of Portugal.[33] During an interview Chhetri said that \"Nothing has been confirmed as yet but yes, I think I am close to getting there.\" indicating that there was a chance of him signing in England.[34] However, in the end, a move never materialized.\n\nBefore the 2008\u201309 season began, Chhetri signed with fellow I-League side [East Bengal].[12] He scored on his debut for East Bengal against Chirag United on 26 September 2008 in which he scored in the 28th minute as East Bengal won the match 3\u20131.[35][36]\n\nChhetri then went on to score a crucial goal for East Bengal during the Federation Cup in which he scored the only goal against his former club, JCT, which led to East Bengal booking a place in the semi-finals.[37] During the semi-final match, East Bengal took on arch-rivals and another of Sunil's former clubs, Mohun Bagan, in which he missed the decisive penalty in the penalty shootout as East Bengal were officially knocked-out of the tournament.[38]\n\nMidway through the season though, reports came out suggesting that two Major League Soccer teams were interesting in Chhetri, along with his international teammate Steven Dias.[39] These two MLS sides were rumored to be the Los Angeles Galaxy and D.C. United. However, on 25 January 2009, Chhetri arrived in Coventry, England to begin a trial at Coventry City of the Football League Championship, thus rejecting MLS.[40] Four days later though, Coventry City manager Chris Coleman said that they would not be following their interest in Chhetri.[41] Four months later though, Chhetri said that he would go back to Coventry City in June 2009 for another extended trial.[42] That never materialized however.\n\nUpon being released by East Bengal, Chhetri signed a two-year contract with another fellow I-League side, Dempo on 22 May 2009.[43] In his contract was a clause which allowed him to leave for trials abroad in the future if he wanted to.[43]\n\nOn 7 August 2009 it was reported that Scottish Premier League side Celtic were linked with a move to sign Chhetri.[44] The Scottish club had watched Chhetri during a pre-season friendly with Santboi\u00e0, a Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B side, in a pre-season fixture.[44] Yogesh Joshee, Chhetri's agent, was quoted as saying, \"I'm waiting to get feedback from Celtic, who saw him on Monday by head scout and then another scout came to watch game, I'll let you know the outcome when I know.\"[44]\n\nThen on 30 August 2009 it was announced by the Hindustan Times that Chhetri had signed a three-year contract with English Football League Championship side Queens Park Rangers but that he was denied a work permit by the British government.[45] According to an article on the Football Players' Association of India's official website, Chhetri was denied a work permit because India were not in the top 70 of the FIFA World Rankings. Chhetri, however, remained positive: \"But it's not the end of the world. I will still continue to work hard for my country and my club Dempo, who have been very supportive.\"[45]\n\nIn March 2010 it was announced that Chhetri was on trial with the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer and that he had played during their pre-season games.[46] He then formally signed for the team on 24 March 2010, becoming just the third Indian to play outside of South Asia and the first Indian to play in MLS.[14] Peter Vermes, the head coach of the Wizards, was quoted as saying \"One thing we really like about Sunil is that he's a crafty player. Technically he's very sharp, and he's a guy that has good attacking tendencies.\"[14]\n\nOn 14 April 2010, Chhetri made his debut for the Wizards in a U.S. Open Cup qualification play-in game against the Colorado Rapids. He started but earned a yellow card and was substituted out of the game at half-time; Kansas City lost the match 1\u20132.[47] On 23 July 2010, it was announced that Chhetri would play in a mid-season friendly against Manchester United.[48] The decision was criticised as a public relations exercise rather than one made on merit, as he had not yet played a league match.[49] On 25 July 2010, Chhetri made an appearance for the Wizards against Manchester United, coming on as a substitute for Teal Bunbury in the 69th minute as Kansas City won the match 2\u20131.[50]\n\nThe next day, it was announced that Chhetri was to compete for the India national team until the end of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.[51] The Wizards (who had been renamed Sporting Kansas City) announced on 5 February 2011 that Chhetri had officially left the team.[52]\n\nOn 10 February 2011, it was announced that Chirag United had beaten United Sikkim to the signing of Sunil Chhetri for the rest of the 2010\u201311 I-League season.[53] On 3 April 2011, Chhetri scored his first goal for Chirag United against Dempo, however, Dempo won the match 4\u20132.[54] Chhetri then scored a brace on 29 April 2011 against ONGC to help salvage a 2\u20132 draw for Chirag.[55]\n\nOn 22 July 2011, it was announced by I-League club Mohun Bagan that Chhetri has signed a one-year deal with the club.[56]\n\nOn 4 July 2012, it was reported that Chhetri had signed a two-year contract with Sporting CP and would play in their reserve team.[57] Then, he made his debut for the side in a Segunda Liga match against Freamunde in which he came on in the 85th minute as Sporting CP B won the match 2\u20130.[58]\n\nOn 13 February 2013, it was announced that in order to get more playing time Chhetri would be loaned out to Churchill Brothers in the I-League for the remainder of the season.[59] He made his debut for Churchill Brothers on 26 February 2013 against Kitchee in the 2013 AFC Cup in which Chhetri started as Churchill Brothers lost 0\u20133.[60] He then scored his first goal for Churchill Brothers in their next match against Semen Padang on 12 March 2013 in which he started and scored in the 27th minute as Churchill Brothers drew the match 2\u20132.[61] After the season ended, Chhetri had scored four goals in eight matches as he helped Churchill Brothers to their second ever I-League title.[62]\n\nOn 19 July 2013, following his release from Sporting CP, Chhetri signed with new direct-entry I-League side Bengaluru for the 2013\u201314 season.[63] He made his debut for the club in their opening game on 22 September 2013 against Mohun Bagan in which he came on as a 46th-minute substitute for Beikhokhei Beingaichho as Bengaluru managed a 1\u20131 draw.[64] Chhetri then scored his first goal for the side in the next game against Rangdajied United in which he found the net in the 67th minute as Bengaluru won 3\u20130.[65]\n\nHe did not score again for Bengaluru till November when, on the 2nd against Mumbai, Chhetri scored from the penalty-spot in the 57th minute to help Bengaluru FC to a 2\u20132 draw.[66] He then scored his first brace of the season against on 1 December 2013 against Shillong Lajong in which his 7th and 34th-minute strikes helped the team to a 2\u20131 victory.[67] Then in the next match against former club Churchill Brothers Chhetri scored another brace as he led Bengaluru FC to a 3\u20131 victory.[68] He then scored his third brace in a row in the very next match against Mohammedan as he led Bengaluru FC to a 3\u20132 win in Kolkata.[69]\n\nChhetri then finished off an impressive first half of the season for Bengaluru with a goal from the penalty spot against Salgaocar, his ninth of the season, as he led the Bangalore side to a 2\u20131 victory.[70] He then scored another goal in the teams very first Federation Cup match against Sporting Goa as Bengaluru FC won 5\u20133 on 15 January 2014.[71] With 14 goals and 7 assist in 23 appearances in the season, Chhetri led Bengaluru FC to their first ever I-League title in its debut season.\n\nChhetri began the season in the 2014 Durand Cup, playing and scoring three times but missed the penalty in the shoot-out in the semi-final against Salgaocar which turned out to be the decisive penalty miss as Bengaluru crashed out.\n\nChhetri scored a brace in his side's first match of 2014\u201315 Federation Cup against Salgaocar in a match which eventually ended 3\u20132 in his side's favor. Chhetri scored another brace in the last group stage match of the cup against Pune, scoring one from open play and one from the penalty spot and thus leading his side to the semi final. He kept up his form in the semi final against Sporting Goa and assisted Sean Rooney for the first goal and scored the second goal in a match which ended 3\u20130 in his side's favor. Chhetri scored his 6th goal of the tournament in the final, thus helping them win the 2014\u201315 Federation Cup. Sunil scored his first goal of the 2014\u201315 season in the 7th round away to Mohun Bagan from a Eugeneson Lyngdoh cross but couldn't prevent his team from going down 4\u20131.[72] The CEO of Bengaluru FC, Parth Jindal confirmed that Chhetri along with Robin Singh and Thoi Singh will become contracted to the Indian Super League at the end of the season, to join the ISL team that drafts them in, but an arrangement has been agreed that they will be loaned back to Bengaluru for the next I-League season.[73]\n\nChhetri was picked up by Mumbai City during the 2015 Indian Super League for \u20b91.2 crores, making him the most expensive Indian player at the auctions.[74] He missed his team's first and second round matches in the 2015 Indian Super League season through national team commitments, playing against Turkmenistan and Oman in Group D of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, but returned against Chennaiyin in a 2\u20130 loss.[75] He scored twice in his second game of the season against Roberto Carlos lead Delhi Dynamos in a 2\u20130 win, the first for his team in the season[76] before scoring again, from the penalty spot, in the very next game against then table toppers Goa managed by Zico.[77] Chhetri made history, becoming the first Indian player to score a hat-trick, in his fourth game of the season, against NorthEast United and taking his total of the season to 6 goals in 4 games.[78] he was the top scorer for Mumbai City for that season as he poached 7 Goals. fast forward to 2018 he was still the pole position of all-time top scorers for Mumbai City FC. he came back in Mumbai colors for 2015\u201316 season, the team done well this time as they reached playoffs for first time, but national commitments & less game time with the likes of Diego Forl\u00e1n & Sony Norde kept him away from score sheet. After two seasons with the islanders, he signed a three-year contract which made him the highest-paid Indian player in 2017.\n\nChhetri was loaned out to Bengaluru for the 2015\u201316 I-League season, where he ended up scoring 5 times in the league, thus helping his team win the league title for the second time in three years. He also scored twice in a round of 16 match against Kitchee in the 2016 AFC Cup, helping his side to an unlikely 2\u20133 win away from home. This would be the first time Bengaluru had reached the quarter finals of the tournament.[79]\n\nOn 9 June 2016, Bengaluru announced that Chhetri had signed a one-year contract at the club, thus reverting his ownership rights to the club from Mumbai City.[80] Chhetri scored twice as Bengaluru won the 2016 AFC Cup semi-final tie by beating Johor Darul Ta'zim in Bengaluru. Chhetri's second goal was a 30-yard strike, where he received the ball from C. K. Vineeth, beat one defender and unleashed a screamer to give Bengaluru the lead.\n\nHe scored 14 goals for the club during the 2017\u201318 Indian Super League season and became the top Indian scorer of the league. He was also the second top scorer for Bengaluru in the league and won the Hero of the League.[81] In 2018, Chhetri went on to win the Indian Super Cup with Bengaluru FC. With 9 goals, he was the topscorer for Bengaluru during their 2018\u201319 season in Indian Super League and helped to win the 2018\u201319 Indian Super League title. Chhetri was Bengaluru's topscorer during their 2019\u201320 campaign. During the 2020\u201321 season, he scored eight goals and thus became the topscorer for Bengaluru in three consecutive seasons. On 15 February 2021, Chhetri became the first player to make 200 appearances for Bengaluru FC.[82]  He scored his 100th goal for Bengaluru FC in the final league match of the 2020\u201321 Indian Super League season against Jamshedpur on 25 February 2021.[83] On 20 June, it was announced that Chhetri had signed a two-year contract extension until 2023.[84] He won the 2022 edition of Durand Cup with the team.[85]\n\nOn 3rd March 2023, Chetri scored a controversial goal against Kerala Blasters in the knockout match of ISL 2022-23 season which led to the Blasters team walking out and the game forfeited in favour of Bengaluru FC. [86]\n\nOn 30 March 2004, Chhetri played his first game for the India U-20 football team in the 1\u20130 victory over Pakistan U-23 team in the 2004 South Asian Games in Pakistan.[87] On 3 April 2004, Chhetri scored twice for the India U-20 team against Bhutan U-23 team in their 4\u20131 victory.[88] On 12 June 2005 Sunil scored his first goal for the senior India national football team against Pakistan.[89]\n\nOn 15 October 2019, Chhetri became the only Indian to secure a place in the list of top 10 goalscorers in international football.[90]\n\nChhetri's first international tournament was the 2007 Nehru Cup. In the opening game, India defeated Cambodia 6\u20130 with Chhetri scoring two goals.[91] He also scored a goal in the 2\u20133 defeat to Syria[92] and another in the 3\u20130 win over Kyrgyzstan[93] to take his goal tally to four. Chhetri was involved in the build-up to Pappachen Pradeep's decisive goal as India beat Syria 1\u20130 in the final to become the first champions of the tournament since 1997.[94] Later in 2007, India began their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. They were knocked out in the first round by Lebanon with Chhetri scoring once in the away leg (a 4\u20131 defeat)[95] and once in the home leg (a 2\u20132 draw)[96] resulting in a 6\u20133 aggregate defeat.[97]\n\nThe 2008 SAFF Championship started with three victories out of a possible three in the group stages. In the opening game, Chhetri scored a goal in a 4\u20130 victory over Nepal.[98] He scored once more in the championship\u2014in the 2\u20131 semi-final victory over Bhutan; this was an equaliser before Gouramangi Singh scored India's second goal to send India through to the final.[99] India lost 1\u20130 to the Maldives in the final and Chhetri played for the full 90 minutes.[100] Later that year, in the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup, Chhetri played in all of the matches and scored four goals. In the 1\u20130 win over Afghanistan, he was involved in the build-up to Climax Lawrence's goal.[101] He also played for the full 90 minutes against Tajikistan (a 1\u20131 draw)[102] and Turkmenistan (a 2\u20131 win).[103] In the semi-final against Myanmar, Chhetri scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory after being assisted by Bhaichung Bhutia to see India through to the final.[104] In the final against Tajikistan, Chhetri scored a hat-trick which enabled India to win the Cup. This automatically qualified India for the 2011 Asian Cup, the first time they had qualified for the tournament in 24 years.[105] His first goal was originally disallowed for offside by Uzbek referee Valentin Kovalenko, who changed his mind after consulting his assistant.[106] Hundreds of fans waited outside the stadium to greet India's new \"poster boy\" and India manager Bob Houghton stated, \"He is remarkable, brave and honest. He never gives up.\"[105]\n\nInitially, Goal.com stated that Chhetri would miss the 2009 Nehru Cup through injury.[107] He played in the tournament, however, and he scored in the second match of the Nehru Cup, a penalty in a 2\u20131 win over Kyrgyzstan,[108] this being first time he had completed a full match since getting injured before the pre-season tour of Spain with his club.[109] He featured in the other three games in the round robin stage of the tournament, including the \"dress rehearsal\" for the final against Syria, but did not score.[110][111][112] Chhetri was one of India's scorers in the penalty shootout victory over Syria in the final after the match had ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He showed flashes of brilliance and scored the second goal in a 5\u20132 defeat at the hands of Bahrain in the 2011 Asian Cup. He also scored a goal against South Korea at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.[113]\n\nHe was named the national team Captain for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualification which took place in Malaysia. On 16 November 2011 Chhetri scored in the 39th and 53rd minute for India against Malaysia in a friendly match played at the Salt Lake Stadium. The match ended 3\u20132 in favour of India.[114]\nOn 11 December 2011 after scoring a goal in SAFF Cup's final he set a new record by scoring seven goals in a single edition of the SAFF Championship surpassing I. M. Vijayan's record of six goals in the 97 edition.[115]\n\nOn 22 August 2012, Chhetri scored a goal with a header in the added time of the first half against Syria in the first match of 2012 Nehru Cup where India won the match 2\u20131.[116] In the second match, which was on 25 August he scored two goals against Maldives, one goal coming from penalty where the team won 3\u20130.[117] In the final against fancied opponents Cameroon, Chhetri scored from a well-taken penalty kick to equalize the score at 2\u20132. In the ensuing penalty shootout which India won 5\u20134, Chhetri went as the second kick-taker from India and scored.[118]\n\nOn 11 October 2017, Chhetri scored and assisted in a 4\u20131 home win against Macau in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, with this win they qualified for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup after missing out in 2015.[119] Chhetri captained India to a 13 match unbeaten run before losing the final match to Kyrgyzstan. Nonetheless, not only did India qualify for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup but also managed to top their group. He was among four renowned Asian players including Ali Daei, Sun Jihai and Phil Younghusband to be chosen for the seeds for the upcoming Asian cup.\n\nIn June 2018, Chhetri scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20130 win over Chinese Taipei in their first match of 2018 Intercontinental Cup.[120] However, after this match, Chhetri was disappointed with the poor turnout at the stadium and he uploaded a video on Twitter requesting people to come to Mumbai Football Arena to support the Indian team. His video went viral and garnered widespread support from fans, celebrities and legendary cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. The stadium was packed with exuberant crowd for the rest of the matches. In the second match of the tournament, which was also Chhetri's 100th international appearance for India and also scored two goals including a goal from penalty spot in a 3\u20130 victory over Kenya.[121] Chhetri scored a goal in the next match against New Zealand, but the match ended 2\u20131 loss for India though India qualified for the final.[122] On 10 June, Chhetri scored twice again in a 2\u20130 win over Kenya in the final to win the Intercontinental Cup title and also equalled Argentina's Lionel Messi's tally of 64 international goals, making him the joint-second active international goalscorer at that time in front of Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo.[123] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament with eight goals.[124] Chhetri's brace against Thailand on 6 January 2019 helped India to get a historic 4\u20131 win over them in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.[125] On 7 June 2021, Chhetri scored twice in a 2\u20130 win over Bangladesh in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification.[126] On 13 October 2021, he scored twice again in a 3\u20131 win over Maldives in the 2021 SAFF Championship, making him the joint-sixth all time international goalscorer at that time,[127] and the third highest active international goalscorer in football, behind only to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[128] On 16 October 2021, he scored again in a 3\u20130 win over Nepal in the final of the 2021 SAFF Championship, equalling Messi's 80 international goals.[129]\n\n\nDue to some injuries after 2021\u201322 Indian Super League season, Sunil was not able to participate for International friendlies against Bahrain and Belarus which were held in March 2022. Then he made his appearance against Jordan in an international friendly fixture which was played as a part of preparing for 2023 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers which was going to be held in June 2022.\nOn June 8, 2022, Chhetri played against Cambodia in 2023 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers where he scored a brace, from a penalty spot and a header from a cross from Brandon Fernandes, by which India won 2\u20130 in Salt Lake Stadium.[130] In the next match against Afghanistan, he scored from a freekick taking his international goals tally to 83. India won 2\u20131 in the match. Chhetri scored his 84th goal against Hong Kong in a 4\u20130 win in the next match.[131][132] India qualified for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup with Chettri becoming the top scorer in the third round of the qualifiers with 4 goals.[133] On 28 March, Chhetri scored his 85th goal against Kyrgyzstan in the tri-nation friendly and overtook Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s to become the fifth-highest international goalscorer.[134]\n\nSunil Chhetri was born on 3 August 1984 to K. B. Chhetri, an officer in the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers of the Indian Army, and Sushila Chhetri in Secunderabad, India.[135][1][136][137] His father played football for the Indian Army football team while his mother and her twin sister played for the Nepal women's national team.[138] Chhetri started playing football from a young age taking part in various tournaments.[139]\n\nOn 4 December 2017, Chhetri married his long time girlfriend Sonam Bhattacharya who is the daughter of former Indian international and Mohun Bagan player Subrata Bhattacharya.[140][141] Sunil Chhetri was named an 'Asian Icon' by AFC on his 34th birthday in 2018.[142] He signed a 3-year deal with global sports giant Puma starting from 2020.[143]\n\nOn 27 September 2022, FIFA launched a documentary on FIFA+, of three episodes named 'Captain Fantastic', which captures a lot of what is unseen and unheard about Chhetri, be it his pre-teen anguish, his debut for India at age of 20, his romance with his future wife and his early days and peak as a football player with many awards and records under his belt.[144][145]\n\nSunil, generally, plays as a left winger in his club football to help and supply his foreign centre forward. But for national team, he generally plays as a centre forward which helped him to act as a finisher and also to score 84 goals from 125 Appearances for his national team with a better goals per game ratio than his club football career. Chhetri's style of play increasingly features elements identical to Kom's trademark never-quit commitment and sheer grit. Where he was once all spark plug and no gears, now it's watchful cruise control, but without concession on any scoring opportunity. In his entertaining From Delhi To The Den (written along with Owen Amos), the former India manager Stephen Constantine says this \"hard-working striker with superb technique\" is crucial to team spirit because he embodies fearlessness. You can see it in the goals he racks up, one after another: the astonishing 80-yard run foxing seven separate defenders to score against Kyrgyzstan, the imperious chip over Kenya's outclassed goalkeeper, the edges, parries and headers piled up relentlessly to break every Indian record.\n\n\"Chhetri is in a category all by himself\", says Marcus Mergulhao, Goan sports journalist of The Times of India, who is himself one of Indian football's most respected institutions. He told me, \"As a player, he has made youngsters fall in love with the game. As a person, he has made the media take note. He is the face and voice of Indian football, who has inspired a generation and given us hope. What's more, he's playing his very best at the moment. The last three years have been phenomenal. The ultimate gift the current crop of footballers can give back to him is take India among the top ten in Asia, and play against the top teams on a regular basis. Chhetri would be pleased with that.\"\n\nMergulhao says the superstar \"is a different player and an extremely different person from the one that I had coffee with for the first time in the summer of 2009. It is his stints abroad that changed everything \u2013 at the Sporting Kansas City in the United States and later with Sporting CP in Portugal. Those experiences opened his eyes to another, more professional approach, more efficient ways of training, and probably showed him just how much ground he needed to cover. He didn't get to play very much, but by the time he returned he was clearly transformed, and you could see on the field that he was clearly a cut above the rest.\"\nWhile still with Sporting CP, Chhetri was lent to the Goa team Churchill Brothers FC Goa, and Mergulhao recalls one crucial game when \"with just a few minutes left, Chhetri stepped up and scored from a free kick so effortlessly that you could tell this man had astounding self-belief. The Brazilian star Roberto Mendes da Silva Beto was also in that side and the regular free kick taker, but Chhetri knew what he was doing, showing incredible poise and confidence. You have to remember that in the first ten years of his career, this player did not win any league title, then in the next seven years, he won four. That's how you understand Chhetri as a footballer, and the influence he has over Indian football.\"\nSunil also likes to score by dribbling the defenders with his fake touches and also from long rangers like how he did against some teams like Johor Darul Ta'zim in 2016 AFC Cup.[146]\n\nDempo\n\nChurchill Brothers\n\nBengaluru\n\nIndia[151]\n\nIndia U-20\n\nOthers\n\n[166]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Chhetri"}, {"id": 187, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/77/1528925/original/marlon-king-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Marlon King", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/marlon-king/1528925", "desc": "Marlon Francis King (born 26 April 1980) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker.\nBorn and raised in south London, he started his career in non-League football with Dulwich Hamlet.

He played for Barnet, Gillingham, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest before moving to Watford in 2005. At Watford he was the Football League Championship top scorer, and was voted Watford player of the season as the club earned promotion to the Premier League. King joined Wigan Athletic in 2008, and subsequently spent loan spells at Hull City and Middlesbrough. He joined Coventry City in September 2010, following his release from prison, and made 29 appearances for the club before controversially switching to Birmingham City in June 2011. He made 79 appearances for Birmingham, before suffering a series of injuries during the 2012\u201313 season that prevented him from playing again, leaving the club in August 2013 by mutual consent. King has also played and scored for the Jamaica national team.\n\nKing has served three jail sentences,[2] and has a number of other criminal convictions including: theft from a person and from a car, criminal damage, and attempting to obtain property by deception; fraudulent use of vehicle licence document, driving without insurance, speeding, drink driving; a wounding incident while playing amateur football, and two cases involving assault of young women rejecting his advances in the Soho area of London. King had his playing contract cancelled by Wigan after being convicted of the sexual assault charges and being sentenced to eighteen months in prison.\n\nKing started his career at Dulwich Hamlet, before becoming a trainee at Barnet.[1] After making 60 first team appearances for Barnet he moved to Gillingham in 2000.\n\nKing left Priestfield to join Nottingham Forest in 2003 for a fee of \u00a3950,000.[3] He scored 15 goals in 57 games. He struggled to win over the fans at Nottingham Forest, before netting an injury-time winning goal in an emotional match against West Ham United, the first after the death of Brian Clough.[4]\n\nKing was loaned to Leeds United in March 2005[5] for the remainder of the 2004\u201305 season. Whilst at Leeds, manager Kevin Blackwell mainly played King out of position on the wing, and as a result King failed to net a single goal for Leeds, including missing a penalty kick against Leicester City.[6] In total he played nine games for Leeds and returned to Nottingham Forest in the summer of 2005 after his loan spell ended.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 King was loaned to Watford for six months, with an option to buy in the January transfer window. He impressed at the Hertfordshire club, scoring 12 goals in 21 games as Watford featured in the upper reaches of the table. King scored his first goal for the Hornets in a 3\u20133 draw away at Plymouth Argyle on 9 August, and followed this up with two goals at Cardiff City in his next match.[7]\n\nThe transfer was made permanent for \u00a3500,000 in January,[8] and King went on to finish top scorer in the 2005\u201306 Championship with 21 goals.[9] Watford finished third, with King scoring in the 3\u20130 semi-final first leg win over Crystal Palace. He played in the second leg, and in the final against Leeds United, which Watford won 3\u20130 to win promotion to the FA Premier League. King was named the club's Player of the Season.[10]\n\nKing scored his debut Premier League goal against West Ham United in the second game of the new season.[11] His second Premier League goal, the first in a 3\u20133 draw with Fulham on 2 October 2006 marked his 100th goal in domestic competition.[12] In the following game, away at Arsenal, he sustained a knee injury which kept him out of the next three games. During his return to fitness he suffered a relapse, and in an exploratory operation it was discovered that some bone had flaked away from his femur.[13] The injury kept him out of action for six months, and he did not return until 14 April 2007, when he came on as a substitute in the 4\u20131 FA Cup semi\u2013final loss to Manchester United at Villa Park.[14] He scored in the final two games of the season, away at Reading and at home to Newcastle United to bring his season tally to four.[11]\n\nWatford were relegated and returned to the Championship for the 2007\u201308 season. With Watford topping the table for much of the first half of the season, King scored ten goals before the end of 2007, including five in successive games in October.[15]\n\nKing had a medical at Fulham in January 2008, which Fulham at the time said he had failed.[16] Following King's conviction in October 2009 Fulham manager Roy Hodgson said \"I think we got lucky in that we didn't sign him. There was a problem with the medical and it also became a problem when we found out he had a jail sentence. Mohamed Al Fayed was not at all keen on that so the transfer was allowed to collapse and he went to Wigan instead.\"[17] He signed for Wigan Athletic on a three-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 25 January 2008.[18] Watford chairman Graham Simpson said that King had left for a fee of \u00a33million rising to \u00a34million, dependent on appearances and Wigan keeping their Premier League status,[19] and it was reported that King doubled his wages to \u00a340,000 per week.[20] King scored his first and what turned out to be only goal for Wigan against Blackburn Rovers on 22 March.[21]\n\n In August 2008, Premier League newcomers Hull City bid an undisclosed amount for King, which Wigan accepted. City agreed personal terms with King, but the move fell through as he was unable to negotiate the terms of his exit with Wigan.[22] Hull instead took King on a season-long loan.[23] He scored his first goal for City, a penalty, on 13 September against Newcastle United, adding a second goal in the second half to win the match 2\u20131.[24] King's loan at Hull was cut short after he reacted in an \"unacceptable manner\" when told he was not in the starting line-up for a match against Arsenal, and he was sent home rather than taking his place among the substitutes.[25][26]\n\nOn 22 January 2009, King's loan spell with Hull ended and he signed a loan deal with Middlesbrough.[26] He made his debut against Chelsea on 28 January. He scored his first goal for Middlesbrough on 14 March against Portsmouth. King grabbed a goal against his old club Hull on 11 April in a win for the Teessiders. However, the season ended with Middlesbrough's relegation from the Premier League. King returned to Wigan in the summer of 2009 season after his loan spell ended. He mainly found himself on the bench for Roberto Mart\u00ednez's side. He was sacked in October 2009, following his conviction and sentencing for sexual assault.[17]\n\nUpon his release from jail former manager Aidy Boothroyd invited King to train with Coventry City to regain his fitness. After impressing during training King and Coventry City became involved in lengthy contract talks which took almost two months to sort out. On 20 September 2010, King signed a one-year deal.[27] King scored his first goal for the Sky Blues from the penalty spot to win the game against Middlesbrough on 4 December,[28] and finished the season as the club's top scorer with 13 goals. He was also chosen Player of the Year.[29]\n\nWith his Coventry contract about to expire, King was reported to have verbally agreed a new deal with the club.[30] However, on 10 June 2011, he agreed a three-year contract with Birmingham City, citing the opportunity to play in the Europa League as a major factor in his decision. The free transfer, under the Bosman ruling, was formally completed on 1 July.[31][32] Coventry's chairman and manager felt \"betrayed\" by the player's actions.[33]\n\nHe suffered knee ligament damage in pre-season training which delayed his Birmingham debut until 11 September, when he played the last half-hour of a 3\u20130 home win over Millwall.[34][35] King scored his first goal in European competition on his first start for Birmingham, in the 3\u20131 home defeat to Braga in the Europa League group stage,[36] and his first League goal for the club on 16 October, a penalty to open the scoring in a 2\u20130 win against Leicester City.[37] King finished the season with 18 goals and 12 assists[38] as Birmingham reached the play-off semi-final.\n\nKing scored the first senior hat-trick of his career to secure a draw after Birmingham were 3\u20130 down after 19 minutes away to Millwall in October 2012.[39] This was the start of a scoring run of nine goals in as many games, finishing with Birmingham's 3\u20132 defeat of third-placed Middlesbrough in December, in which King was fouled for and converted a penalty just before half-time to level the scores, and ran onto a through ball by Peter L\u00f8venkrands to score the late winner with what the Birmingham Mail described as a \"clinical finish\".[40] Although put up for sale in January,[41] a bid from Shanghai Shenhua was rejected in February.[42] However, in March, his season was brought to a premature close due to a long-term knee injury deteriorated, requiring an operation.[43] On 28 August 2013, it was announced that Marlon King would be leaving Birmingham, after his contract was terminated by mutual consent in order to reduce the club's wage bill.[44]\n\nHaving initially been rejected by the club,[45] in September 2013 King signed deal with Sheffield United to remain with the League One club for the remainder of the season.[46] Having made his United debut in a 1\u20130 home loss to Preston North End,[47] he scored his first goal for his new club two games later in a 1\u20131 draw with Crawley Town at Bramall Lane.[48] King quickly fell out of favour following the arrival of new manager Nigel Clough however, and following a spell on the sidelines due to a knee injury he was released in December 2013.[49]\n\nIn 2004 King played an important part in Jamaica's unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, scoring six goals in eight games. He played for Jamaica in the friendly against Ghana on 29 May 2006 which they lost 4\u20131.[50] He was named in the squad to face England in a friendly on 3 June 2006, but was sent home for an alleged breach of discipline. Jamaica lost the match 6\u20130.[51][52]\n\nAs a result of the incident, the Jamaican Football Federation banned King from international football until May 2008. When Captain Horace Burrell returned as the JFF president he lifted the ban.[53] King played in Jamaica's 1\u20131 draw with Costa Rica in February 2008, where he provided the cross for Jamaica's goal. King also played for Jamaica in a friendly against Trinidad and Tobago scoring a goal and captaining the team in the absence of Ricardo Gardner due to injury.[54]\n\nKing made his first appearance for Jamaica since 2009 as a second-half substitute in a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to Panama on 27 May 2012,[55] and played in the next game, again as a substitute. He and Chris Humphrey were then suspended from the next two World Cup qualifiers for breaking curfew.[56] He was not selected again after the suspension, and announced his retirement from international football in November 2012.[57] He scored 12 goals from 22 senior international appearances.[60] After the resignation of Theodore Whitmore, new coach Winfried Sch\u00e4fer recalled King to the team for the World Cup qualifiers in September 2013.[61]\n\nKing is married to Julie, a former Miss Zambia, and has three children.[62]\n\nWhile on loan to Hull City, King was alleged to have headbutted teammate Dean Windass in a casino in Scarborough. Hull City stated that the matter had been dealt with internally, and both players remained with the club.[63] Windass later described the incident as a \"storm in a teacup\".\n\nAs of October 2009, King had convictions for 14 offences.[64] He received fines, driving bans, community service sentences, a rehabilitation order and orders to pay compensation on convictions including: theft from a person and from a car, criminal damage, and attempting to obtain property by deception; fraudulent use of vehicle licence document, driving without insurance, speeding, drink driving; a wounding incident while playing amateur football, and two cases involving assault of young women rejecting his advances in the Soho area of London.\n\nThree cases led to imprisonment. In May 2002 he received an eighteen-month prison sentence for receiving stolen goods, in relation to a BMW convertible that he was found driving, but was found not guilty of a charge of assaulting a police officer in a related case. His solicitor commented that \"His reputation will be tarnished forever, whatever success he achieves, he'll always be referred to in a Tyson-esque way as someone who has had a criminal past and that is a considerable penalty.\"[65][66] Gillingham continued to pay his salary while he was in jail, and supported in his appeal, which resulted in the sentence being reduced to nine months, with King being released on licence after five months, returning to the Gillingham team within two days of his release.[67]\n\nIn December 2008, again in the Soho area, King was arrested on suspicion of punching a 20-year-old female university student in the face, causing a broken nose and split lip for which she was treated in hospital. He was later convicted of sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and sentenced to 18 months in prison and placed on the Sex Offender Register for seven years.[68] Wigan Athletic immediately initiated the cancellation of his contract.[20] King's agent, Tony Finnigan, said he was confident that his client would find a club on his release,[69] and accused the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) of failing to offer support. Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the PFA, said that the PFA did not represent players when they have broken the law and been convicted on non-footballing matters. It would support members with anger management or other issues if approached but no approach had been made by King.[17] After his release, King made an appeal against the conviction which was unsuccessful.[70]\n\nKing was arrested and bailed once more in April 2013 after a car crash which left one man seriously injured,[71] and in July of the same year, he was again arrested in connection with a hit-and-run incident which had left a second man injured.[72] King pleaded 'not guilty' to the first incident in November of the same year and had a trial date set for March 2014.[73] On 15 May 2014, King of Torksey, Lincolnshire, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and banned from driving for three years.[2]\n\nFollowing his release from prison, King moved to Zambia with his family.[74]\n\nWatford\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_King"}, {"id": 188, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/72/1427848/original/lee-bowyer-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Lee Bowyer", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/lee-bowyer/1427848", "desc": "Lee David Bowyer (; born 3 January 1977) is an English football manager who, since March 2018, has been the manager of Championship club Charlton Athletic, his first managerial appointment.

He was capped once by the England national team.\n\n", "full_desc": "\n\nLee David Bowyer (/\u02c8bo\u028aj\u0259r/; born 3 January 1977) is an English football manager and former professional player.\n\nAs a player, he was a midfielder who featured for Charlton Athletic, Leeds United, West Ham United (two spells), Newcastle United, Birmingham City and Ipswich Town in over 18 years as a professional. He made 397 appearances in the Premier League, took part in semi-finals of the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League with Leeds and won the Football League Cup with Birmingham in 2011. Bowyer was capped once by the England national team. His career was punctuated by various incidents both on and off the field.\n\nBowyer has managed two of the clubs for which he formerly played: after three years in charge of Charlton Athletic, he left to become Birmingham City's manager in March 2021 and was sacked at the end of the following season.\n\nBorn in Canning Town, London,[1] Bowyer played for youth team Senrab[3] before joining Charlton Athletic as a schoolboy.[4] He turned professional in April 1994.[1] He first drew attention in 1995, when he and teammate Dean Chandler failed a drugs test for cannabis use. Bowyer was dropped from the England under-18 squad and suspended for eight weeks while he took part in a rehabilitation course organised by the Football Association (the FA).[5][6] He went on to become a first-team regular, making 58 appearances for Charlton and scoring 14 goals.[7] A particular highlight was Bowyer's hat-trick in a memorable 5\u20134 victory over Wimbledon FC in a League Cup second round first leg tie in September 1995.[8]\n\nIn 1996, he was signed by Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson for \u00a32.8\u00a0million, which was a record for a British teenager.[9] Later the same year, Bowyer was convicted of affray and fined \u00a34,500 following an incident in a McDonald's restaurant in London in which CCTV footage showed Bowyer throwing chairs and racially abusing a staff member of Asian origin.[10][11]\n\nInitially, Bowyer was kept out of the Leeds first team by Alfie Haaland and David Hopkin; he eventually replaced Hopkin in the 1998\u201399 season, and from then on was a first-team regular. He was a key player in David O'Leary's Leeds side that qualified for the Champions League in 1999\u20132000, and which reached the semi finals of the UEFA Cup in 2000 and the Champions League in 2001. In the Champions League run he scored crucial goals against A.C. Milan, Barcelona and Anderlecht. He was voted the Leeds player of the year by supporters in both 1998\u201399[9] and 2000\u201301.[12]\n\nFollowing an incident near a Leeds nightclub in January 2000, in which an Asian student suffered severe injuries, Bowyer and teammate Jonathan Woodgate were charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent and affray.[13] An initial trial at Kingston upon Hull Crown Court collapsed in April 2001 after an article in a Sunday newspaper,[14] and following a second trial at the same venue which ended in December 2001, Bowyer was cleared of both charges while Woodgate was convicted of affray and sentenced to community service.[15] Bowyer was generally recognised as playing some of the finest football of his career during this period[16] and would often go straight from court to play for Leeds.[17] In 2005, the player agreed a \u00a3170,000 out-of-court settlement of a civil action for damages brought by the victim and his brother, who had been less seriously hurt in the assault.[18]\n\nAfter Bowyer's acquittal, Leeds fined him four weeks' wages for a breach of the club's code of conduct. Despite having had the backing of the club during the trial and the club paying his extensive legal fees, Bowyer took exception to the fine and was placed on the transfer list.[19] The dispute was later settled and Bowyer removed from the transfer list,[20] though he returned to it at the end of the season after turning down a new five-year contract. A \u00a39\u00a0million fee was agreed for a move to Liverpool, which fell through with manager G\u00e9rard Houllier not convinced the player had the \"hunger or desire\" to play for the club.[21] In January 2003, Bowyer signed for West Ham United.[22] He had made 265 appearances for Leeds in all competitions, scoring 55 goals.[7]\n\nBowyer signed for West Ham United on an initial six-month contract for a nominal transfer fee, which meant that should West Ham be relegated at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, the club would not be burdened with a large Premiership salary.[23] The transfer was not popular with a section of West Ham supporters who questioned Bowyer's attitude towards racism. A protest against his signing was held outside Upton Park before Bowyer's introduction to the crowd.[24] Claims that Bowyer would have received a \u00a31\u00a0million bonus had West Ham stayed up were denied by the club's then manager Glenn Roeder.[25] In the event, Bowyer was hampered by ankle injuries and made only eleven appearances for West Ham.[26] West Ham were relegated and Bowyer was not offered another contract.[26]\n\nAfter West Ham were relegated at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, Bowyer joined Newcastle United on a free transfer in July 2003.[27]\n\nIn April 2005, Bowyer was in the media spotlight again after an on-pitch brawl with teammate Kieron Dyer in Newcastle United's Premier League match with Aston Villa. This resulted in a red card, plus an automatic three-game ban, for each player. The Football Association fined Bowyer \u00a330,000 and imposed an additional three-game ban, and the club fined him six weeks' wages; Dyer was not fined as Bowyer was perceived to have thrown the first punch. In addition, Bowyer was charged by Northumbria Police in connection with the brawl with offences under section four of the Public Order Act. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of using threatening behaviour and was fined \u00a3600 and ordered to pay \u00a31000 costs.[28]\n\nBowyer made 98 appearances for Newcastle in all competitions and scored 11 goals.[7]\n\nBowyer rejoined West Ham United, the club he supported as a boy, in June 2006 for an undisclosed fee, declaring that he had \"unfinished business\" with the club.[29] He made 22 appearances in the 2006\u201307 season,[30] which was disrupted by a dislocated shoulder suffered in West Ham United's 6\u20130 loss to Reading in January 2007.[31] However, Bowyer made a quick and sooner-than-expected recovery and played in five of West Ham's crucial games towards the end of the season.[30]\n\nHe regained a regular place in the Hammers first team at the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season, scoring his first goals for West Ham against Wigan Athletic and Middlesbrough, and then two more in the 5\u20130 victory over Derby County.[32]\n\nIn January 2009, Bowyer signed for Birmingham City on loan until the end of the 2008\u201309 season.[33] He made his debut on 17 January at home to Cardiff City in the Championship, scoring an equalising goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time to make the score 1\u20131.[34] Following the expiry of his contract with West Ham United, Bowyer signed a two-year contract with Birmingham in July 2009.[35] He scored winning goals in consecutive Premier League matches, against Fulham and Wolverhampton Wanderers, to take Birmingham into a mid-table position at the end of November,[36][37] and was part of the team that went on a run of 15 games unbeaten in all competitions, including a club record 12 unbeaten in the top flight,[38] as they finished in ninth place, the club's best for more than 50 years.[39]\n\nIn September 2010 Bowyer was forced to apologise for verbally abusing a West Bromwich Albion supporter. The incident occurred following Bowyer's substitution after he had committed a rash challenge on Gabriel Tama\u0219.[5] In the absence through injury of Craig Gardner, Bowyer returned to the starting eleven for the match against champions Chelsea in November 2010, and scored the only goal of the game to give his team a surprise victory,[40] and then followed that up with a late equaliser against Manchester United.[41] In January 2011, television replays highlighted incidents,[42] unnoticed by the match referee, in which Bowyer stamped on Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna and appeared to rake his studs down the same player's Achilles. Suggestions in the media that Bowyer could receive a six-match ban[43] prompted Birmingham manager Alex McLeish to argue that the football authorities were not treating all clubs equally when using television evidence.[42][44] Bowyer received the standard three-match ban for violent conduct.[45]\n\nFrom 2010, Bowyer held the record for most  yellow cards received in the Premier League;[3] by the end of that year, he had 98 yellow cards in the competition as well as five red.[5][46][A]\n\nHe made his first appearance in a major final in February 2011, in the starting eleven as Birmingham defeated favourites Arsenal 2\u20131 in the League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.[50] At that time, it was reported that he was not to be offered a contract extension,[50] in May, McLeish indicated an offer would be made,[51] but after Birmingham's relegation to the Championship, Bowyer left the club when his contract expired at the end of the 2010\u201311 season.[52]\n\nOn 10 July 2011, Bowyer joined Ipswich Town on a free transfer. He signed a one-year contract.[53] He scored his first goal for Ipswich with a late winner against former club West Ham United on 27 September.[54] He was released at the end of the 2011\u201312 season, having scored twice in 29 appearances, after which Bowyer retired from playing.[55]\n\nDuring his early career at Leeds, Bowyer played for the England under-21 team, making 13 appearances for the national side.[56]\n\nBowyer's form during the 2000\u201301 season led to calls for inclusion in the England squad; however, the Football Association ruled that he could not be selected until the court case in relation to an assault on an Asian student was completed.[57] The FA eventually cleared Bowyer for selection following the conclusion of the court case and England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson called him into the squad for an international friendly against Portugal in September 2002.[58] Bowyer made his England debut in the game, setting up a goal for Leeds teammate Alan Smith.[59] It was his only appearance for England.[56]\n\nIn the autumn of 2015, Bowyer spent a month as a guest coach of Watford's under-21 team, working under former Leeds teammate Harry Kewell.[60] After coaching at his first professional club Charlton Athletic,[61] Bowyer was appointed as their assistant manager under Karl Robinson on 1 July 2017.[62]\n\nOn 22 March 2018, Bowyer was named caretaker manager of Charlton  Athletic after former manager Karl Robinson left by mutual consent.[63] His managerial career began with a 2\u20130 win two days later against Plymouth Argyle[64] After winning his first three games, in April he was given the role until the end of the season.[65] His spell in charge ended on 13 May after Charlton were beaten 2\u20130 on aggregate by Shrewsbury Town in the League One play-off semi final.[66] On 14 June, Bowyer was renamed caretaker manager until further notice,[67] and on 6 September, his role was made permanent on a contract lasting until the end of the season.[68]\n\nIn Bowyer's first full season at the club, he guided the side to a third-placed finish in League One, and they faced Doncaster Rovers in the play-offs over two legs. Charlton won the away leg 2\u20131, courtesy of goals from Joe Aribo and Lyle Taylor.[69] Doncaster's 88th-minute goal meant the second leg finished 3\u20133 in normal time. Both teams scored in extra time, resulting in a 4\u20134 aggregate score, and Charlton won the penalty shootout 4\u20133.[70] They earned promotion to the Championship by beating Sunderland 2\u20131 in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium, returning to the second tier of English football after a three-season absence.[71]\n\nOn 17 June 2019, Bowyer turned down the offer of a contract extension, with the club (and owner Roland Duchatelet) announcing that Bowyer and the club were unable to reach an agreement.[72] However, he later reversed his decision by signing a new year-long deal.[73] In October, he received a three-match touchline ban for \"improper conduct and/or questioning the integrity of a match official\".[74] Following the club's takeover by East Street Investments, Bowyer signed a new three-year deal on 22 January 2020.[75] Charlton were relegated on the final day of the 2019\u20132020 season following a 4\u20130 defeat at his former club, Leeds United.[76]\n\nBowyer resigned as Charlton manager on 15 March 2021.[77]\n\nOn 16 March 2021, Bowyer replaced Aitor Karanka as head coach of Birmingham City; he signed a two-and-a-half-year contract.[78] After 16 months in charge, Bowyer was sacked on 2 July 2022. During his final season in charge, Birmingham finished in 20th in the EFL Championship and won just four games in 26 after November 2021.[79]\n\nBirmingham City\n\nIndividual\n\nCharlton Athletic\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Bowyer"}, {"id": 189, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/101/2014992/original/shaun-wright-phillips-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Shaun Wright-Phillips", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/shaun-wright-phillips/2014992", "desc": "Shaun Cameron Wright-Phillips (born 25 October 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a winger.

In 2015, he joined Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls alongside his brother, Bradley. Wright-Phillips joined Phoenix Rising FC in 2017.\n\nThe England international scored six goals in 36 appearances for the national team, which included selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nShaun Cameron Wright-Phillips[3] was born on 25 October 1981[1] in Greenwich, Greater London.[4] He is the son of former England international Ian Wright, who adopted him at the age of three.[5] His younger brother, Bradley Wright-Phillips, is also a professional footballer and the all-time top scorer for the New York Red Bulls.[6] Wright-Phillips grew up in Brockley and attended Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College in New Cross Gate.[7] Wright-Phillips is of Trinidadian and Grenadian descent.[8]\n\nWright-Phillips was released by Nottingham Forest aged 17 and Manchester City took him to Maine Road.[citation needed] He made his first-team debut as a substitute in the second leg of a League Cup match against Burnley, replacing Terry Cooke.[9] His league debut came two months later at Port Vale. Brought on as substitute striker, he helped his team turn a 1\u20130 deficit into a 2\u20131 win. His shot resulted in the first Manchester City goal, which Wright-Phillips attempted to claim, though the strike was later credited as an own goal instead.[10] He then started the next two matches in place of Paul Dickov, who was absent through injury.[citation needed] Once Dickov recovered, Wright-Phillips returned to the reserves, making only one further first team appearance that season.[citation needed] City finished second in the First Division, resulting in promotion to the Premier League for the 2000\u201301 season.[citation needed]\n\nWright-Phillips featured more regularly than the previous season but was still not fully established in the first team, making 12 starts and seven substitute appearances playing in a variety of attacking positions.[citation needed] Manchester City's stay in the Premier League was brief; at the end of the season they were relegated.[11]\n\nUnder Keegan, Wright-Phillips firmly established himself in the first team, not as a forward, but as a wing-back.[12] Keegan was known for playing attacking football, and decided to use the attacking Wright-Phillips in a traditionally defensive position due to his mobility and dribbling ability.[12] From 2000 to 2003, Wright-Phillips won Manchester City's Young Player of the Year award four times in succession,[13] surpassing Steve Kinsey's record of three times.[14]\n\nOn 17 November 2004, he became one of the main targets of racist chants from sections of the Spanish crowd at an international friendly between England and Spain in Madrid.[citation needed] However, he brushed that aside with his performance in his next Manchester City appearance at Portsmouth, saying to reporters after the match, \"I just let the football do the talking\".[citation needed] He also has a similar response regarding his father, saying in an interview with manchesteronline.co.uk: \"The press brought up my adopted father's name. They relate to his name and that is fine by me \u2013 it comes with the name, but I will be my own man.

During his next game against Arsenal he scored in a 3\u20130 League Cup win which saw City progress to the tournament's semi finals.[30][31][32] He found himself in-and-out of the team under manager Roberto Mancini, with new signing Adam Johnson's form forcing Wright-Phillips to be a substitute in most matches, including City's match at his former club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.[citation needed] He came off the bench to replace Johnson in the 60th minute and then set up Craig Bellamy's second goal in the 4\u20132 win.[citation needed] Despite his impact in the match, Wright-Phillips had not secured a place in the team.[citation needed] He started for City on the final match of the 2009\u201310 Premier League against West Ham at Upton Park, where he scored the equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw.[citation needed]\n\nThe 2010\u201311 season saw Wright-Phillips only make seven league appearances, with the increased competition for places following the signings of David Silva and Yaya Tour\u00e9 resulting in him rarely being included in the club's matchday squad.[citation needed] City won the 2010\u201311 FA Cup, and despite being left out of the squad for the final, he did contribute some appearances earlier in the cup run,[33] including coming on as a substitute against Manchester United in the semi-final.[34]\n\nOn 31 August 2011, the final day of the transfer window, Wright-Phillips signed for Queens Park Rangers (QPR) on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.[35] He made his full debut for QPR against Newcastle United on 12 September 2011, making the starting line-up and winning man of the match by supporters.[36] He failed to score a goal for almost a year before scoring his first the following season for QPR against Walsall in the League Cup on 28 August 2012.[37] His only goal for QPR in the Premier League came during the derby against former club Chelsea on 2 January 2013, which ended 1\u20130.[38] Despite this, QPR would find themselves relegated to the Championship at the end of the season.[citation needed] QPR would return to the Premiership at the first time of asking, defeating Derby County in the play-off finals, though Wright-Phillips would increasingly find his role throughout the season diminished to the occasional cameo from the subs bench and reserve outings.[citation needed] After featuring even more sporadically during 2014\u201315, QPR announced that Wright-Phillips would be released from his contract in a batch of players that included fellow former England internationals Rio Ferdinand and Joey Barton.[39]\n\nIn June 2015, Wright-Phillips began training with Major League Soccer club the New York Red Bulls to regain fitness following his departure from QPR.[40] Impressing head coach Jesse Marsch, he suggested he would sign for the club when his contract officially expired on 30 June.[41]\n\nOn 27 July, he completed a move to join his brother, Bradley Wright-Phillips, at the New York Red Bulls.[42] He made his debut on 1 August, coming off the bench to win a penalty and assist his brother in a 3\u20131 victory at the Philadelphia Union.[43] Wright-Phillips was named in the MLS Team of the Week following the performance.[44]\n\nWright-Phillips was released by the Red Bulls at the end of the 2015 Major League Soccer season, but was later re-signed on 25 January 2016.[45][46]\n\nOn 23 February 2017, Wright-Phillips signed for United Soccer League club Phoenix Rising FC.[47] He made his debut on 26 March 2017, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Toronto FC II.[48]\n\nWright-Phillips announced his retirement from playing on 24 August 2019 at the age of 37.[49]\n\nWright-Phillips made his England debut as a substitute for Nicky Butt against Ukraine on 18 August 2004. He scored the last of England's goals in a 3\u20130 win, described by BBC Sport as \"crowning a solo run with a stunning finish.\"[50] He was a regular member of England's squad during qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and made his first competitive start in a 1\u20130 away win over Wales.[51] After a decline in form, however, especially a poor performance away to Northern Ireland, and a lack of matches following his move to Chelsea, he missed out on a place in the squad for the World Cup finals.[52]\n\nAfter a good start to the 2007\u201308 season, Wright-Phillips received an England recall to play against Germany in a friendly match at the new Wembley Stadium.[53] Wright-Phillips was brought on as a substitute in the second half during the match in which England lost 2\u20131 to Germany and he was named the England sponsor's man of the match after an impressive performance.\n\nOn 8 September 2007, Wright-Phillips was selected to start against Israel in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier he scored the first goal in the 3\u20130 victory and won the England sponsor's man of the match award with his performance.[citation needed] He was then selected to start for England against Estonia and scored his third goal for England and the opener in a third consecutive 3\u20130 win at Wembley.[54] He was selected in England's critical Euro 2008 qualifying match against Croatia, substituted at half time in favour of David Beckham with England trailing 2\u20130, with England eventually losing 3\u20132 and therefore missing out on Euro 2008.[55]\n\nAlso one note, on English training he ruined fellow player career.

Torosidis was also given a five-game ban by the Super League Greece following his sending off for headbutting midfielder Sebastian Leto in the closing stages of the match. The punishments were handed down on Thursday after hundreds of fans invaded the pitch following the league leaders' tempestuous 2\u20131 win that took them ten points clear of their local rivals with just seven matches to play. Some Olympiakos supporters threw punches and kicks at the visiting players and battled with police.[9]\n\nIn January 2013, Torosidis refused to sign a new deal with the Greek champions after moving to the Athens outfit in 2007. Martin Jol, manager of Fulham F.C. was linked with a move for the Torosidis, who was believed to be available for around \u00a3500,000. The Fulham boss snapped up Giorgos Karagounis on a free transfer in the summer \u2013 and Torosidis is desperate for a fresh challenge in a different European league. \"I\u2019m not going to sign a new deal,\" Torosidis told the Sun newspaper. \"I want to move abroad.\"[10] On 22 January 2013, he moved from Olympiacos to Roma, signing a contract with the Roman club expiring on 31 June 2015.\n\nOn 23 January 2013, Torosidis moved to Italian Serie A side Roma for only \u20ac400,000 and signed a contract valid until 30 June 2015, with the option to stay for the 2015\u201316 season. The Italian club had beaten Fulham to the Greece international's signature, who had previously revealed he would not be renewing his contract with the Athens outfit. Olympiakos had been keen to sell the versatile defender this month in order to risk losing him for nothing at the end of the season.[11] Roma's sporting director Sabatini in his introduction speech said: \"He is an experienced player and has spent a long time playing for the best team in Greece, Olympiakos. He played over three hundred league matches for them as well as quite a few appearances in European competition and for Greece. I'm grateful to him for choosing Roma over the other offers he received. \"What memories do I have of him? One above all else. When he made a major contribution to beating Lazio and eliminating them from the Champions League here in the Stadio Olimpico a few years back.\" [12]\n\nHe made his debut against Bologna in a 3\u20133 draw. He scored his first goal for Roma in a 2\u20133 away win over Atalanta.

The match ended 2\u20133, with Roma securing a position in the 2013 Coppa Italia Final against Lazio, where they subsequently lost.[13]\n\nOn 9 January 2014, with a very early Vasilis Torosidis goal, Roma labored to a 1\u20130 victory over Sampdoria in the Coppa Italia to help shake off the 3\u20130 league loss against Juventus last weekend. It was indubitably important for Roma to get over their first defeat of the season as quickly as possible, and to that end, Rudi Garcia sent out a side that was a mixture of first team players, fringe players, and youngsters.[14]\nOn 17 March 2014, Torosidis scored as Roma beat Udinese Calcio to maintain their grip on second place from Juventus in Serie A and restored the two-goal margin before Dusan Basta of Udinese ensured a nervous final 10 minutes for Roma.[15][16]\n\nOn 2 August 2014, Roma announced that Torosidis had signed a new contract with the Giallorossi, keeping him at the club until 2017.[17][18] The 29-year-old, who represented his country at this summer's World Cup in Brazil, explained his reasons for staying at Stadio Olimpico at a Press conference. \"My future is at Roma, I signed for three years. I\u2019m staying at Roma because they\u2019re a big club with big targets and I want to win something with this team. We are a strong team with players of a great level. We want to win the Scudetto but it is not easy. It will be a season with a lot of matches. We need to be humble and ready for the season. All the fans are expecting a strong team and that's what we are. We want to win the Scudetto. There will be a lot of difficult matches, there are teams like Juventus, Napoli and Fiorentina.

According to newspapers, La Liga side M\u00e1laga CF are interested in the Greek defender, who is not in the plans of Luciano Spalletti and consequently is in A.S. Roma summer transfer list. Roma have been searching for an alternative at right-back as it appears the Greek's place in the Giallorossi side has not been confirmed.[25]\n\nOn 31 August 2016, the last available day in the Italian summer transfer window, Torosidis moved to Bologna for \u20ac1 million and signed a contract valid until 30 June 2018, with the option to stay for the 2018\u201319 season, as two weeks earlier has turned down an offer by Torino.[26] On 11 September 2016, he made his first appearance with the club as a substitute in a 2\u20131 home win against Cagliari Calcio.\n\nOn 11 October 2016, Torosidis added to the growing injury worries of the club after being substituted only 18 minutes into his country's 2\u20130 World Cup qualifying away win against Estonia.

On 5 April 2018, he completed Bologna's training and seem ready to return in action.[33] On 1 July 2018, he mutually solved his contract with the club.\n\nOn 28 July 2018, following a five-year spell in Italy, Torosidis has returned to his homeland, penning a contract with former club Olympiacos. The length of his Olympiacos contract was not stipulated.[34]\nOn 25 October 2018, Kostas Fortounis stood over a corner kick, expertly sent a looping cross towards the area, and experienced defender was on hand to head into the right corner, giving the lead in a 2\u20130 away  UEFA Europa League group stage against F91 Dudelange. After scoring the winning goal for Olympiacos against Dudelange, defender Vasilis Torosidis has been included in the UEFA Europa League team of the week.[35] On 1 November 2018, he opened the score in a 2\u20130 away Greek Cup win against Panachaiki. It was his first goal with the club in the 2018\u201319 season.[36]\nA week later, he scored with a left footed shot from very close range to the bottom right corner, after an assist from Mady Camara following a corner in a hammering 5\u20131 win game against F91 Dudelange in the UEFA Europe League group stage.[37]\n\nOn 13 September 2020, Torosidis officially announced his retirement from professional football, after the end of the 2019\u201320 Greek Football Cup which he won 1-0 against AEK as the team leader.[38]\n\nTorosidis made his international debut for the Greece national team in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Turkey.

He was a member of the UEFA Euro 2004-winning squad, and also represented Greece at UEFA Euro 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup. With 139 appearances, he is the most capped player in the history of the Greece national team.\n\nKaragounis was born in Pyrgos.[3]\n\nKaragounis began his professional career in 1996 when he signed on loan for Apollon Smyrnis from Panathinaikos. In his first couple of years with the Athens-based club, he already showed signs of his talent as a very energetic player in the centre of midfield who could also score goals. After two seasons with Apollon, he returned to his parent club Panathinaikos in 1998, the club where he learned his trade.[citation needed]\n\nAt Panathinaikos he became a fixture in the first team for the next five years. Although Panathinaikos did not win the Alpha Ethniki title during his spell due to several controversial reasons, including a ball-fixing scandal,[4] the team was always a title contender, and had good runs in both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup, with Karagounis scoring important goals for the team. He scored 6 times in 24 league matches during his first season with the Greens, and in the 2000\u201301. In the UEFA Champions League, he appeared in all 12 of Panathanaikos' games, scoring a memorable goal from a free kick against Manchester United at Old Trafford.[5]\n\nThe following season, at the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, Karagounis scored a wonderful goal against Arsenal, beating David Seaman with a header to help his team reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League.[6]\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Karagounis left Panathinaikos to join Italian Serie A club Inter Milan. During his first season with Inter, he was not a regular starter in the league, mainly appearing in European and Coppa Italia matches. At the end of his first season in Italy, despite Karagounis spending a lot of time on the substitutes' bench, Inter could only finish a disappointing fourth, with city rivals Milan winning the title. However, he performed well enough to be called up to represent Greece at UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal.[citation needed]\n\nAfter helping Greece win that tournament, he returned to Italy for the 2004\u201305 season. Under Roberto Mancini, he was again mainly used in European and domestic Coppa Italia matches rather than in Serie A matches. He won the 2004\u201305 Coppa Italia, helping Inter beat Roma in the final. At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, Inter finished third in Serie A, with Juventus winning the title. Inter also reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, suffering elimination by Milan.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, Karagounis moved to Portugal to sign a three-year contract with Benfica,[7] who are based at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz, the stadium where he won the Euro 2004 final with Greece.[8]\n\nKaragounis scored a couple of memorable long-range goals while in Portugal,[9] against Shakhtar Donetsk, and a free kick against Desportivo das Aves.[10]\n\nKaragounis' first season at Benfica was challenging, as he had difficulty establishing himself as a first-team regular. However, he became a regular starter in his second season, putting in some excellent performances and becoming a fan favourite, who were by this time managed by Fernando Santos, who already knew Karagounis from their time together at Panathinaikos. After a successful stint with Benfica, Karagounis seemed ready to return to play in Greece, again for Panathinaikos.[citation needed]\n\nKaragounis would return to the Est\u00e1dio da Luz to play for a Benfica All-Stars team in a charity match against a team that included Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo in 2010.[11]\n\nKaragounis' contract with Benfica was due to expire in July 2008, but his immediate departure was negotiated due to personal issues.[12] After his release in the summer of 2007, Karagounis immediately returned to Panathinaikos, signing for the club for the next three years.[12] He quickly re-established himself in the team again, scoring key goals, especially in Europe.[citation needed]\n\nWith his acquisition by the Athenians regarded as the start of a new era at the club, Karagounis emerged not only as a leading figure at club level, but for Greece as well. He established himself as the captain of the national team. Karagounis' grit and dedication continued to give Panathinaikos an edge as the team made progress in Europe.[13] On 3 September 2009, Karagounis extended his stay until 2012 and stated he wanted to end his career at the club.[14] As captain of the team, he won his second Superleague title and the Greek Cup. A 79th-minute strike by Karagounis secured Panathinaikos three UEFA Europa League points in Group F.[15]\n\nOn 11 September 2012, Karagounis left Panathinaikos to join English Premier League side Fulham on a free transfer.[16] Karagounis became the eighth Greek player from the Euro 2004-winning side to play in the Premier League, after Nikos Dabizas, Stelios Giannakopoulos, Vassilios Lakis, Theodoros Zagorakis, Angelos Basinas and Kostas Chalkias. Speaking at Fulham's Motspur Park Training Ground, Karagounis said, \"I'm delighted to have signed for Fulham Football Club and I am excited by a new challenge in England and the Premier League. I'm looking forward to working under Martin Jol and playing alongside some fantastic players at this Club.\" Then-Fulham manager Martin Jol added, \"Giorgos Karagounis has a wealth of club and international experience and I'm happy that he's joined us for this season. He's been an influential player for his club sides and is a renowned player in world football as he's about to become the most-capped player for Greece. He brings many certain qualities to our squad.\"[17]\n\nKaragounis made his debut for the club in the Premier League on 29 September 2012, against Manchester City at Craven Cottage, coming on in the 81st minute to replace Chris Baird.[18] Karagounis played the full 90 minutes for Fulham in their 4\u20130 loss to Liverpool at Anfield. He scored his first goal in England on 5 January 2013 in the FA Cup against Blackpool in the 80th minute, with a \"stunning 25-yard half-volley\" which went in off the underside of the crossbar; the match ended 1\u20131.[19] On 12 January 2013, a week after his FA Cup strike, he scored his first Premier League goal against Wigan Athletic in the 22nd minute.[20]\n\nKaragounis was 1 of 12 players released by Fulham at the end of the 2012\u201313 season.[21]\n\nHowever, Karagounis declared his interest to return to Fulham through his agent Paschalis Tountouris.[22] On 9 July 2013, Karagounis signed a new one-year deal to rejoin Fulham.[23][24] In his second season with the Cottagers, Karagounis scored his only goal in a 4\u20133 loss for League Cup against Leicester City when he equalised with just three minutes to play, but could not prevent Leicester from scoring a late winner.[25] Karagounis suffered from muscle problems throughout the season, but on 19 April 2014, he came on as a substitute in his last match for the club in a 3\u20131 away defeat against Tottenham Hotspur.[26] Fulham was relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season.\n\nKaragounis was one of nine players released by Fulham in the summer of 2014.[27][28]\n\nKaragounis captained Greece's entry to the 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and the team came very close to winning, losing 1\u20130 to Spain in the final. After that, he soon became a regular on the national team. He made his first full international appearance against El Salvador in 1999 and went on to appear in 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification.[citation needed]\n\nThe highlight of his international career was undoubtedly winning the UEFA European Championship for Greece at Euro 2004. He was a key player for Greece and famously scored the first goal of the tournament against Portugal, a stunning long-range shot that shocked the hosts and gave Greece the confidence they needed to win the game and progress in the tournament.[29] After winning Euro 2004, Karagounis continued to play on a regular basis for Greece in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification and UEFA Euro 2008. On 26 March 2008, Karagounis participated in a Greece\u2013Portugal friendly match in D\u00fcsseldorf. This proved to be somewhat of a highlight of his international career, as he scored two almost identical well-placed free kicks to give Greece a 2\u20131 victory.[30]\n\nKaragounis, as a captain of Greece, contributed to the nation's qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. As captain, he led Greece to its first win in a World Cup match with a 2\u20131 win against Nigeria. On 8 October 2010, against Latvia, Karagounis reached 100 international appearances, equaling the record of his former Greece teammate Angelos Basinas. On 12 October 2010, Karagounis made his 101st appearance, becoming the second-most capped player in Greek footballing history, behind Theodoros Zagorakis, and scoring his seventh goal in the victory against the Israel national team. On 7 October 2011, Karagounis was awarded by Zagorakis and Basinas for reaching 111 appearances with Greece. The awarding ceremony took place at the Karaiskakis Stadium in Athens before Greece's kickoff against Croatia.[citation needed]\n\nOn 8 June 2012, Poland played with Greece on the opening day of Euro 2012. Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny fouled Greek international Dimitris Salpingidis, resulting in a red card for Szcz\u0119sny. Karagounis took the penalty against substitute goalkeeper Przemys\u0142aw Tyto\u0144, who saved Karagounis' penalty.[31]\n\nOn 16 June 2012, Karagounis started the final match of Group A against Russia, making him Greece's joint-most capped player with 120 caps, together with Theodoros Zagorakis. Karagounis scored the only goal of the match, at the stroke of half-time.[32] This meant Greece qualified for the next stage of the competition. The second half was slightly less dramatic but had its share of talking points. Coming off a significant goal, Karagounis made a mad dash to the Russian box. The captain looked like he was going to score another, but his leg was caught by a Russian defender. Karagounis was adamant he had earned a penalty, but the referee was not impressed and booked him for simulation. Karagounis received his second yellow card of the tournament, forcing him to miss the quarter-finals.[33][34]\n\nOn 12 October 2012, Karagounis played in the second half in the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, making the 121st appearance for his country. With this match, he set a new record of most caps for Greece, surpassing Zagorakis. He also scored a free-kick goal against the Liechtenstein national football team. Karagounis played another inspiring and energetic role throughout the qualifying campaign and helped lead to its third World Cup finals appearance. Despite the waning number of starts for the 37-year-old, his influence was still large for Greece. Greece head coach Fernando Santos, who worked with Karagounis at both Panathinaikos and Benfica, held him in high regard due to the sureness the veteran exudes. \"We have confidence and know we can beat any opponent\", Karagounis said during World Cup qualifying.[35] Karagounis played the entire 120 minutes of the match between Costa Rica and Greece for the World Cup 2014, consisting of 90 minutes of regular time and 30 minutes of extra time.[citation needed]\n\nKaragounis retired from international football after Greece's World Cup elimination in a penalty shootout loss to Costa Rica. He left as the nation's most capped player with 139 appearances over 15 years since making his debut in 1999. Greece's goalscorer in the Costa Rica match, defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos, paid tribute to his departing leader: \"He's written his own story ... he's the record holder [of caps], he's given everything for the team and had to make concessions for it... He's left us a legacy for the future. He shouldn't worry.\"[36][37]\n\nAs a midfielder, Karagounis was short in stature, standing at 5 feet nine inches. He was largely known for his tough, gritty play on the field. He gained many comparisons to \"The General\", Mimis Domazos. Karagounis was known for his dribbling, and creative passing, especially the accuracy of his long passes. Karagounis was described as a \"dogged worker in the midfield and a deliverer of fine set plays\".[38][39] During his career he was one of the finer set piece exponents in Europe. His dribbling was noted as one of his strengths, with Karagounis able to win his own free kicks as well as provide a sometimes-laboured attack with bursts of energy. He also possessed a shooting ability from distance and combined his varied attacking talents with an aggression in midfield that made him able to win the ball back, as well as produce with it at his feet.[40]\n\nInter Milan\n\nPanathinaikos\n\nGreece U21\n\nGreece\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgos_Karagounis"}, {"id": 193, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/113/2255183/original/tom-h-bschman-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 H\u00fcbschman", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/tom\u00e1\u0161-h\u00fcbschman/2255183", "desc": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 H\u00fcbschman (Czech pronunciation: [\u02c8toma\u02d0\u0283 \u02c8\u0266\u026ap\u0283man]; born 4 September 1981) is a Czech football player who plays for Jablonec.

Here he played professional football while attending the University of Antioquia, where he later obtained a degree in dentistry. He began his professional career in 1970 at Atl\u00e9tico Nacional, where he became a starting defender until 1980. During his time in Atl\u00e9tico Nacional he won two Colombian League Championships in 1973 and 1976. In 1981, he transferred to Atl\u00e9tico Bucaramanga and also played 6 matches with the Colombia National Team during the qualifying matches for the 1982 World Cup. In 1982, he played his last year with Deportes Tolima until he retired at the end of the season.\n\nMotivated by Uruguayans An\u00edbal Ru\u00edz and Luis Cubilla, he started managing the Colombian team Once Caldas in 1986. The following year, the Colombian Football Federation hired him to manage the national team's youth squad and then was quickly promoted to manage the Senior Squad to compete in the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where they reached third place by beating the host Argentina. During this time, he was also hired to manage his former team, Atl\u00e9tico Nacional. Then, in 1989, he had his most successful year in his career. He led Atl\u00e9tico Nacional, composed of many Colombian legends, to win the Copa Libertadores for the first time for any Colombian club. Using Atl\u00e9tico Nacional players as a base for the National Team, he qualified the team to the 1990 World Cup after 28 years of absence. In December, he lost the Intercontinental Cup to AC Milan at the last minute of overtime. An upset to what would have been the perfect season. The following year he led Colombia to its best performance in World Cup competition until 2014 by reaching the second round and losing to Cameroon.\n\nAfter the World Cup, he was hired as coach of Spain's Real Valladolid. He was rumored to be the next Real Madrid coach for the 1991\u201392 season. In 1993, he was voted as the South American coach of the year by El Pais and he was ranked third in Spanish Newspaper Marca's list of the world's greatest managers.\n\nHe returned to Colombia in 1992. and got his team Am\u00e9rica de Cali champion of Colombia. In 1993, he got Colombia qualified for a second time in a row to a World Cup, with a historic triumph over Argentina in Buenos Aires by 5\u20130. That score made Colombia a surprising favorite for the 1994 World Cup, but the performance there was disappointing, as the team was eliminated in the first round, being defeated by United States and Romania, although it was understood that the team's make-up had been heavily influenced by rampant threats from the cartel groups at the time.\n\nHe later had a brief stint as coach of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and in 1995 he was hired as the trainer of Ecuador National Football Team. After failing to get Ecuador qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, he returned to Colombia to coach Millonarios.\n\nIn 1999, he briefly coached Costa Rica, and in 2000 he also coached Peru for a few months.\nHe would later return to coach Colombia for the 2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning it for the first time. His latest jobs as a coach would include Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, where he won the domestic league and the Asian Champions League and a new stint for Colombia and Argentina's Col\u00f3n de Santa Fe.\n\nHe worked for FIFA as a technical adviser where he has held various coaching seminars around the world with the likes of Fabio Capello and Cesar Menotti.\n\nIn April 2007 Maturana accepted an offer from Argentine Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata.

He later had periods with Accrington Stanley and Bradford Park Avenue before returning to York as trainer-coach for three years.\n\nBorn in Darfield, West Riding of Yorkshire, Storey worked at a W. H. Smith in Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire at the age of 14 before becoming a miner at Houghton Main Colliery.[2] Meanwhile, he played non-League football for local colliery sides Ardsley Welfare and Grimethorpe Athletic before signing for Huddersfield Town in September 1943.[2] He was released by the club soon after and returned to play non-League football for Wombwell Athletic, where his father worked as a trainer.[2] He joined Third Division North team York City for a fee of \u00a3100 in May 1947, combining mining with playing and training for the club.[2] He was later rated as \"perhaps the best bargain York City ever bought\".[3] He made his debut in a 2\u20132 home draw at Bootham Crescent with Wrexham on 27 May 1947 and finished the remainder of the 1946\u201347 season with three appearances.[2][4] He missed one game for York during the 1947\u201348 season, making 42 appearances and scoring 12 goals in all competitions.[5] An injury resulted in him missing the FA Cup semi-final against Newcastle United on 26 March 1955 and several league games, with many fans believing this cost the club promotion, although he was able to play in the 2\u20130 defeat to Newcastle in the semi-final replay on 30 March at Roker Park.[2][6]\n\nHe received a benefit match in 1955 and was granted a free transfer in 1956 after making 354 appearances and scoring 42 goals in all competitions for York, joining hometown club Barnsley in May to run their reserve team.[2] He managed to play for Barnsley due to an injury to one of their first team players and he was able to \"demonstrate that his old skills had not deserted him\".[2] He made 29 appearances and scored four goals in the league for Barnsley before joining Accrington Stanley in October 1957,[1] where he \"once more belied his age with some top class displays\".[2] He made 30 appearances and scored two goals for Accrington in the league and joined Bradford Park Avenue as player-coach of the reserves in July 1959.[1][2]\n\nHe made two league appearances for Park Avenue and following his retirement as a player he rejoined the York coaching staff as a trainer-coach.[2][7] He left after three years in 1963 and worked for Richmond Sausages as a van driver for two years.[2] He was then employed as a bus driver for the West Yorkshire Road Car Company and after York won the 1983\u201384 Fourth Division championship he drove the open top bus that paraded the team around York.[2] He resided in Haxby, North Yorkshire[3] until his death in York, North Yorkshire on 6 April 2010 at the age of 90.[8] His death was marked a day later by a minute's applause before York's game at home to AFC Wimbledon,[3] which the team won 5\u20130.[9]\n\nStorey played as a left-sided inside forward and has been described as a \"ball-player\", a \"little gem\" and a \"creative spark\".[2] He was held in \"great esteem\" by York fans due to his ball work and vision.[2] Following his death, it was said that \"it will be for his jinking skills and sweet left foot that he will always be remembered\".[10]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Storey"}, {"id": 198, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/1624/32468525/original/jos-holebas-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Holebas", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/jos\u00e9-holebas/32468525", "desc": "Jos\u00e9 Lloyd Cholevas (Greek: \u0399\u03c9\u03c3\u03ae\u03c6 \u03a7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ad\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2; born 27 June 1984), known as Jos\u00e9 Holebas [xo\u02c8se xo\u02c8levas], is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a left back or a left midfielder for Watford.

Born and raised in Germany, he played for the Greece national team from 2011 to 2016.\n\nHolebas was born in Aschaffenburg, West Germany, to a Greek father, Achilles, from Vasiliki, Trikala, and a German-American mother, Lowis. Achilles left the family not long after he was born and Jos\u00e9 was raised only by his mother and her family.[4][5]\n\nHolebas' first club was local youth team S\u00fcdring, which he joined in 1992 when he was eight. He played at non-professional youth football teams in German football which included playing for S\u00fcdring, FC Kleinwallstadt and TSV Teutonia Obernau until 2001, when his girlfriend got pregnant and Jos\u00e9, at age 18, decided to temporarily give up football. He had to work the double shift as a warehouse assistant in order to financially support his family. A year later, in 2002 and with the guidance of his German-American uncle, Alfonso, whom Holebas described as his \"second father\" and \"who gave me the kicks I needed to get my life back on track,\" helped him begin playing football again. He played for local youth side Aschaffenburg-Damm from 2002 to 2005.[6]\n\nIn 2005, Holebas was signed by German 6th-tier Landesliga Bayern-Nordwest club FC Viktoria Kahl. Under manager Antonio Abbruzzese, he played as a striker and scored 15 goals in 33 appearances and finished among Landesliga's top scorers. 1860 Munich scouts approached him and Holebas joined their club in the summer of 2006.[7]\n\nIn his first season in Munich, Holebas was in 1860's second team, where, at 22 years of age, he was considered \"too old\" by the club's youth academy coach, Ernst Tanner. Holebas officially made his debut for 1860 Munich II on 5 August 2006 in a Regionalliga S\u00fcd game against 1899 Hoffenheim. A year later, in the summer of 2007, Holebas signed his first professional contract with the first team. He made his professional debut for the \"Munich Lions\" on 21 September 2007 at 23 years of age against St. Pauli, in a 2. Bundesliga game.\n\nHolebas accumulated three years of professional football experience in the German second tier with 1860 Munich, with the side finishing 11th in 2007\u201308, 12th in 2008\u201309 (while also dropping back to 1860 Munich II for a number of games) and 8th in 2009\u201310. In the summer of 2009, new coach Ewald Lienen, advised 25-year-old Holebas to stay back and play as a defending left-winger.\n\nHolebas finished his five-season stint in Germany with both Viktoria Kahl and 1860 Munich, scoring a total of 34 goals in 154 games in all competitions. Despite initially disliking the club as a child due to being a childhood fan of 1860's fierce cross-city Munich rivals Bayern, Holebas stated his changed opinion of the club that gave him his breakthrough in professional football, stating, \"I'll forever be grateful to 1860 Munich.\"[6]\n\nEwald Lienen left 1860 Munich to become the coach of Superleague Greece club Olympiacos. Lienen signed Holebas for a transfer fee of \u20ac500,000. Holebas stated in an interview, \"My father is Greek, but this is only the second time that I have come back to the country. When I was [here] first here, I was very young and do not remember many things, but I must say that I am very happy to play in the old country.\"\n\nOn 15 July 2010, Holebas made his debut for Olympiacos in a 5\u20130 away victory over Albanian club Besa Kavaj\u00eb in the first leg of a Europa League second qualifying round tie. On 5 August, Olympiacos were knocked out of the UEFA Europa League by Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv, on the away goals rule and after a 2\u20132 draw. Olympiacos sacked Lienen; the new coach, Ernesto Valverde, began to use Holebas both as a defending and an attacking left winger, depending on Olympiacos' opponent. Holebas scored his first goal for the club on 20 March 2011 in a 6\u20130 home league win over AEK Athens, which sealed the club's 38th Greek championship title.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, Holebas opened the score with a header against Borussia Dortmund in a 3\u20131 home victory on matchday 3 of the Champions League group stage. On 3 March 2012, Holebas scored his second goal of the season in a 2\u20130 away league victory over OFI Crete, a goal that won the Superleague goal of the week award.[8]\n\nOn 11 March, the next week, Holebas scored Olympiacos' second goal from the penalty spot in a 3\u20130 league away win over Aris. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title for their second season in a row, winning their 39th Greek Championship title. On 28 April, Holebas started the Greek Cup Final against Atromitos, where he missed a penalty kick in the first-half. Nonetheless, Olympiacos went on to win the Cup 2\u20131 after extra time, at the Athens Olympic Stadium. Holebas in the 2011\u201312 season scored 3 goals in 35 games in all competitions.\n\nOn 23 September 2012, Holebas netted his first goal of the season by scoring Olympiacos' second goal in a 4\u20131 home league win over Panthrakikos. On 7 October, Holebas scored his second goal of the season by netting Olympiacos' first and only goal of the game in a 1\u20130 league home win over Asteras Tripoli. The next week, Holebas scored his third goal of the season by scoring the second goal in a 4\u20130 home league win over Skoda Xanthi. On 29 October, Holebas scored his fourth goal of the season by scoring Olympiacos' second goal and second equalizer in a 2\u20132 away league draw against Aris. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title for a third season in a row, their 40th Greek Championship title.\n\nOn 11 May 2013, Holebas started and played in the Greek Cup final, where Olympiacos went on to retain the cup for a second season in a row with a 3\u20131 victory after extra time over Asteras Tripoli with goals from David Fuster, Rafik Djebbour and Djamel Abdoun at the Athens Olympic Stadium.[9] Holebas the 2012\u201313 season scoring four goals in 40 games in all competitions, winning another league and cup double.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, there were rumours that Holebas would join Turkish club Be\u015fikta\u015f, according to the Turkish media, which reported that he had agreed to sign a deal with the Black Eagles. The Turks reportedly offered the 29-year-old defender a three-year contract, with an annual salary reaching \u20ac750,000, a significant pay rise than what he was being paid by Olympiacos. The deal, however, was not completed, and Holebas decided to stay in Piraeus, subsequently signing a contract extension lasting until 2017.[10]\n\nOn 27 October 2013, Holebas scored his first goal of the season by netting Olympiacos's third goal with a wonderful free-kick in a 5\u20131 league home win over OFI Crete. On 18 January 2014, he scored his second goal of the season by netting their second goal in a 2\u20130 home league win over Levadiakos. Olympiacos went on to retain their league title again for a fourth season in a row by winning their 41st Greek championship. He finished the 2013\u201314 campaign scoring two goals in 29 games in all competitions and winning another League title.\n\nHolebas finished his very successful four-season stint with Olympiacos by netting ten toal goals in 135 games in all competitions, and also by winning the Superleague Greece four times in 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312, 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314; the Greek Cup twice and in a row in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313; and participating in both the Champions League and Europa League.[11]\n\nOn 30 August 2014, Holebas joined Serie A club Roma for a \u20ac1 million transfer fee from Olympiacos, plus \u20ac500,000 in bonuses. He signed a three-year contract.[12] After being presented to the media in Rome by Roma CEO Italo Zanzi, Holebas stated why he joined Roma in a press conference: \"I had other offers, but I decided on Roma because they are a great club at a European level. Was I expecting this move? I had discussions, it was a difficult situation because I was at the World Cup, but I am happy to be here because this is a great club. My preferred position? Certainly I will do my best. I am a left-back, playing in an attacking manner. I can also play at centre-back, but the Coach will decide.\"[13]\n\nOn 24 September 2014, Holebas made his debut for the club, by playing the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20131 away league victory over Parma in their fourth match of the 2014\u201315 Serie A.[14] On 30 November, Holebas scored his first goal for Roma in an important 4\u20132 home victory over Internazionale in their 13th match of Serie A to stay in touch with the top of the table. He finished his 2014\u201315 season scoring one goal in 34 games in all competitions, whilst keeping veteran English international left back Ashley Cole out of the team for much of the season. For the second season in a row, Roma finished runners-up to league champions Juventus, marking for the first time since the 2009\u201310 season that Holebas did not win any piece of silverware.\n\nOn 25 June 2015, it was reported that recently promoted Premier League club Watford were close to securing a deal for Holebas after the side confirmed interest by contacting the Italians and admiring the player's profile; they allegedly offered between \u20ac2\u20133 million for his services. At that point, there was a summit at Trigoria between Roma Sporting Director Walter Sabatini and the entire staff, including head coach Rudi Garcia and Simone Beccaccioli. Talks between the two clubs continued, where it was growing likely that the deal would officially be announced the following Monday. Fabio Parisi, Holebas' agent, spoke to VoceGiallorossa about the situation: \"Nothing is done. There is confirmation of Watford\u2019s interest, but there is absolutely nothing done. For now, the player's will is to have a holiday.\"[15] On 2 July, Watford officially announced the signing of the Greek international from Roma, which Holebas denied when he found out 24 hours later after the announcement, claiming he did not know anything about it. He later stated in an interview, \"They arranged my transfer without asking me. I haven't signed anything yet, I have to see the contract first. I don't know why this has happened, I know that both Roma and Watford announced my transfer, but they'd have to talk to my representatives first. I never said I wanted to leave Roma. I'll sign after first agreeing to the terms of the contract. I can't understand why this has happened, I came back from my holiday in Dubai and everyone started telling me my transfer had been officially announced. I'm in Germany right now, how could I sign a contract?\"[16]\nFollowing that claim, and after days of confusion and wondering if Holebas was going to either continue his contact and talks with Watford and eventually sign for them, or if he was going to turn his back on Watford's offer to stay committed to the three-year deal he signed at Roma a year earlier, it was reported that on 5 July that Holebas had decided to revive his contact and discussions with Watford.[17]\n\nWatford eventually officially completed the signing of Holebas for an initial fee of \u00a31.8 million, which Roma confirmed. On 8 August 2015, he made his debut for the club, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20132 away league draw against Everton in their opening 2015\u201316 Premier League match and Watford's return to the top division. He picked up a yellow card in the match.\n\nPlaying just three games in all competitions in the first two-and-a-half months of the season, he struggled to secure a first place spot in the Watford side, sitting third in the pecking order behind Nathan Ak\u00e9 and Ikechi Anya for the starting left-back spot. As a result, rumours circulated that he could be off-loaded already in the January transfer window.[18][19] After three months of not playing, Holebas returned to the side on 26 December to play the full 90 minutes in a 2\u20132 league draw away against reigning league champions Chelsea, picking up a yellow card.[20]\n\nOn 7 January 2016, reports surfaced that French Ligue 1 giants Marseille were keen on signing Holebas, and that their head coach M\u00edchel was seeking to rekindle the relationship that he and Holebas formed whilst working together for a season-and-a-half at Olympiacos.[21] On 1 March, Holebas complained on social media after being dropped for Ak\u00e9 in a game against Bournemouth.[22]\n\nOn 24 March 2016, radio station Radyospor reported that Holebas had been offered to Turkish giants Fenerbah\u00e7e, as a potential replacement for Caner Erkin if the latter left at the end of the season.[23] However, Holebas remained at the club, and on 9 April 2016, he thought he had scored his first goal with a header just before the break in a 1\u20131 home draw against Everton, helping the club end a poor run of four consecutive league defeats. It was later given as a Seamus Coleman own goal.[24]\n\nOn 10 September 2016, Holebas scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20132 comeback victory at West Ham United.[25] On 16 October, he scored the only goal of an away win against Middlesbrough.[26] In January 2018, Holebas signed a new deal to keep him at Vicarage Road until the summer of 2020.[27] On 26 August 2018, Holebas scored to give his club a two-goal lead in a 2\u20131 victory over Crystal Palace, his first goal of the 2018\u201319 season.[28] On 2 September 2018, Holebas helped his club to maintain their perfect start to the Premier League season, setting up goals for Troy Deeney and Craig Cathcart in a 2\u20131 home win against Tottenham.[29] On 10 November 2018, he scored his second goal of the season in a 1\u20131 away draw against Southampton.[30] On 15 December 2018, he curled in a left-footed strike from the edge of the box to give Watford a two-goal lead in a 3\u20132 win against Cardiff.[31] On 12 May 2019, in the last matchday of the season and his 100th match in Premier League, West Ham's winger Michail Antonio causing the problems, outpacing the Greek left back onto Felipe Anderson's through ball, and the former Greek international tugs him back receiving a straight red card, that will keep him away of the FA Cup final, in a hammering 4\u20131 home loss against West Ham, but a day later Holebas will be available for the FA Cup final against Manchester City after his red card was rescinded.[32][33]\n\nHe started the 2019\u201320 season as a key figure of the club's defence. On 7 December 2019, Jose Holebas has ruled himself out of this game with an ankle injury, and his rehabilitation process is under examination.[34] He returned to the squad as a substitute in a 2\u20131 home win against Wolverhampton.[35] He left Watford at the end of the season as he found playing time hard to come by and admitted in a statement that he felt \"left out\".[36]\n\nOn 18 August 2020, Holebas rejoined Olympiacos. Holebas was available as a free agent after leaving Watford at the end of the 2019\u201320 Premier League campaign. The vastly experienced left-back, now 36 years of age, has been signed as a replacement for Konstantinos Tsimikas who recently joined Liverpool and in overall he participated in 114 Premier League games, contributing with six goals and 14 assists.[37]\n\nIn September 2021, Holebas decided to leave professional football and accepted the offer of his close friend, coach-player Peter Sprung, signing a contract with Hessenliga club Bayern Alzenau and at the same time continue the lessons for obtaining UEFA coaching diplomas.[38]\n\nBeing born in West Germany, Holebas was eligible to represent the Germany national football team and through his Greek and African-American heritage was also eligible to represent Greece or the United States in international football. He never appeared for any of the countries at youth level. In an interview about his international ambitions with a Greek reporter, he stated, \"My dream growing up was to play for Germany, but my father is Greek so I would be happy to play for Greece.\" In November 2011, he received Greek citizenship as \"Iosif Cholevas,\"[39] and on the 11th of the same month, he officially made his debut for Greece in a friendly match against Russia, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus.\n\nIn 2012, Holebas was part of Greece's 23-man squad for the UEFA Euro 2012 finals held in Poland and Ukraine. He started the first two group games against Poland in a 1\u20131 draw and against Czech Republic in a 2\u20131 loss and was dropped for the third match due to heavy criticism that his attacking tendency was becoming hazardous to the usually-solid defensive tactics of Greece. Nonetheless, he did come on for the final 30 minutes of the match, playing admirably and assisting Greece in holding on to the 1\u20130 win against Russia, which took them to the quarter-finals. Here, however, Greece fell to Germany by a score of 4\u20132, a defeat in which Holebas picked up a suspension for receiving another yellow card after his previous booking in the game against Russia.[40]\n\nHolebas scored his first international goal for Greece in a 1\u20130 victory against the Republic of Ireland in November 2012, a friendly match played at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.\n\nHolebas' impressive 2013\u201314 season with Olympiacos prompted his nomination from Greek manager Fernando Santos as a part of the final 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. He played in all of Greece's matches, which included a 3\u20130 loss to Colombia, a 0\u20130 draw with Japan, a 2\u20131 victory over Ivory Coast in the Group Stages, and the 1\u20131 (5\u20133 penalty shoot-out) defeat to Costa Rica in the last 16, during which he converted his penalty kick.[41]\n\nOn 27 March 2015, two days before the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier for Greece against Hungary, media reports claimed that Holebas had trained normally with his Roma squad after departing from Austria on Tuesday. \"On Monday Jos\u00e9 underwent a radiographic examination of which it was diagnosed that he was suffering from a left rib case injury. The player trained in Austria under an individual program but was not fit to be available to play against Hungary,\" the Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) said in an announcement. The HFF added that reports out of Italy cited by the Greek media \"lead to completely erroneous conclusions in regards to the willingness of the player to contribute to his commitments with the national team any further.\"[42] This was probably the cause for the non-call-up of the player for the national team, creating tension with new Greek sporting director and former national team teammate Georgios Karagounis.[43] On 4 September 2015, Holebas returned to the national side after being picked by caretaker coach Kostas Tsanas, where he appeared for Greece for the first time in 12 months in Greece's 1\u20130 home defeat against Finland in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Piraeus. The defeat officially ended Greece's hopes of qualification to the final tournament in France in a poor overall qualifying campaign for Greece.[44]\n\nIn 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Holebas played his 38th and last ever cap for Greece when he came on as a second-half substitute in the Greek 2\u20130 home win over Cyprus on 7 October 2016 in Piraeus. Then on 10 October 2016, after a 2\u20130 away win against Estonia, Holebas officially announced his decision to retire from International football because he feels that it is time for the younger footballers of Greece to step up and become Greek international regulars.[45] However, on 1 September 2017, Holebas admitted he had left the Greece national team due to his dislike of national team coach Michael Skibbe.[46]\n\nAt the age of 18, Holebas became the father to a daughter.[47] In 2011, he married Diana J\u00e4ger, a German woman who also hails from Aschaffenburg. Holebas speaks German and English fluently and although he does not speak much Greek, he understands it.

He began his career as a youth player at Manchester United in 1995, turning professional in 1999, but signed for Preston North End two years later after a short loan spell. He spent three years with Preston, maintaining a healthy goals to games ratio, before transferring to Leeds United in 2004. After three years to Leeds he moved on to Fulham for a season, before settling at Sunderland in 2008. He moved north to Scotland to play for Rangers in January 2011. He helped the club to the SPL title in 2010\u201311 and also played in the 2011 League Cup final victory, before departing at the end of the 2011\u201312 season, when his contract expired. He joined Bury for a one-season spell in August 2012. In addition to these clubs he has also played for Port Vale, Norwich City, Ipswich Town, and Doncaster Rovers on loan. He was released by Bury in May 2013, and chose to retire in November 2013 after failing to find a club. Before representing his country at a senior level, he also played for both the under-21 team and the B team.\n\nHe began his management career with Linfield in October 2015, and led the club to a NIFL Premiership, Irish Cup and County Antrim Shield treble in 2016\u201317. The following season proved a disappointment, before they secured the league title and the Northern Ireland Football League Cup in 2018\u201319. They retained the Premiership trophy in 2019\u201320, and would win another Premiership and Irish Cup double in 2020\u201321. He then guided Linfield to a fourth consecutive league title in the 2021\u201322 season.\n\nHealy was born and raised in Killyleagh, Northern Ireland, and played for Crossgar, Lisburn Youth and Down Academy High School in Downpatrick.[3] He made eight appearances for Manchester United's junior B team in the 1995\u201396 season and signed for the club as a trainee in June 1996. He made 28 league appearances for the B team in 1996\u201397 and finished the season as top scorer with 25 goals. He signed as a professional in November 1997 and scored a combined 20 league goals for the A and B teams in 1997\u201398. He made his debut for the reserve team in April 1998, coming on as a substitute for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r in a 2\u20130 win over Birmingham City. In 1998\u201399, he remained a prolific scorer for the youth team, scoring 11 goals in 11 appearances to finish as the team's top scorer for the season, while also becoming a regular for the reserves. He only managed two goals in 12 league appearances, though he was more productive in the Manchester Senior Cup, scoring four in five, including opening the scoring in the final against Oldham Athletic, which United won 3\u20130.\n\nHealy made his first appearances for the Manchester United first team in pre-season ahead of the 1999\u20132000 campaign, coming on for Andy Cole in a 9\u20130 win over Omagh Town on 3 August 1999, before coming on for Nicky Butt in a 2\u20130 win over Wigan Athletic the next day. He made his competitive senior debut for United on 13 October 1999, coming on for Danny Higginbotham in the 66th minute of a 3\u20130 away defeat to Aston Villa in the League Cup. He remained a regular in the reserves that season, playing 13 times and scoring eight goals before being sent on loan to Port Vale in February 2000. He managed just three goals in 16 games for Brian Horton's side, who were relegated to Division Two.\n\nIn 2000\u201301, Healy was included in the Manchester United squad for their Champions League second group stage match against Panathinaikos on 21 November 2000, but he did not come off the bench. A week later, he made his second appearance for the club away to Sunderland, again in the League Cup; with the score at 1\u20131 early in extra time, Healy came on for Luke Chadwick, and hit the crossbar, but Sunderland were able to find a winner from a late penalty.[5] He made his Premier League debut on 23 December 2000 in a 2\u20130 victory against Ipswich Town at Old Trafford; he came on as substitute in the 60th minute, and with 10 minutes remaining, he hit the post denying him a debut goal.[6] This was his final appearance for United as he signed for First Division club Preston North End six days later, initially on loan to allow him to play against Sheffield United on 30 December; Healy scored the opening goal as Preston took a 2\u20130 lead, only to end up losing 3\u20132.[7] A permanent move was completed on 3 January 2001, as Preston paid Manchester United a fee of \u00a31.5\u00a0million, before Healy signed a four-and-a-half-year contract.[8][9][10]\n\nHealy made his debut for Preston against Sheffield United on 30 December 2000; he scored after just four minutes in the 3\u22122 loss at Bramall Lane.[7] In the remainder of the 2000\u201301 season, Healy made 26 appearances for Preston and scored 10 goals. He was a virtual ever-present in the 2001\u201302 season, appearing in 44 league games and scoring 10 goals. In the 2002\u201303 season he was less successful after Craig Brown replaced the departed David Moyes.[11] By the end of January 2003 he had made only 23 league appearances but scored five goals. Healy joined Nigel Worthington's Norwich City on a month's loan at the end of January. In the end he stayed for the remainder of the season, but in thirteen appearances for the \"Canaries\" he scored only scored past Sheffield Wednesday[12] and Wimbledon.[13] Having attempted to sign him from Man United two years previously, Norwich attempted to sign Healy permanently from Preston but were denied by Brown.[11] He found his scoring form again in 2003\u201304, and netted 15 times in 42 matches for Preston. For this feat he was given the club's Player of the Year award.\n\nAiming for a move away from Deepdale, Healy got his wish in October 2004, as he was signed by Leeds United for a \u00a3650,000 fee.[11] In his first season at Leeds he was the club's joint top scorer alongside Brian Deane with seven goals, despite only joining Leeds halfway through the season.[14] During his time at Elland Road he was linked with dozens of moves to other clubs, the most notable rumour reported in the press being a potential \u00a33 million move to Manchester City.[11] He again finished as joint top scorer in the 2005\u201306 season, both he and Rob Hulse on fourteen goals. Leeds reached the play-off finals this season but lost in the final 3\u20130 to Watford. During the management of Kevin Blackwell Healy found himself regularly being played out of position at Leeds, mainly as a right winger, with Leeds rotating Hulse, Cresswell and Blake up front. Healy then finished the following 2006\u201307 season as Leeds' top scorer with ten goals. With Leeds relegated into League One, he left the club at the end of the campaign.\n\nHealy reunited with former Northern Ireland boss Lawrie Sanchez at Fulham in July 2007 for a reported fee of around \u00a31.5 million.[15] He scored his first goal for Fulham in a pre-season friendly against South China in the Asia Trophy, with a low diving header. He scored fifty seconds into his league debut for the club following a mistake from Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann. He also found the net in his second game against Bolton Wanderers, in a 2\u20131 win at Craven Cottage. However, he only scored two further top-flight goals in the season (past Reading and Sunderland), as well as two cup goals past Bolton and Bristol Rovers. Following the sacking of Sanchez, new manager Roy Hodgson preferred a strike partnership of the American pairing of Brian McBride and Eddie Johnson, leaving Healy on the bench.[16]\n\nIn July 2008, Healy caused controversy when he adopted the posture of a flute player (similar to a previous incident involving Paul Gascoigne) in response to a question posed by Celtic fans chanting \"Where were you on the Twelfth?\" during a pre-season friendly match against Celtic at Craven Cottage. Healy subsequently apologised profusely for any offence he may have caused and signed many autographs for Celtic fans after the game.[17] He remained out of favour with Roy Hodgson, who regarded his signings Andy Johnson and Bobby Zamora ahead of Healy in the pecking order.[11]\n\nIn August 2008, Healy joined Sunderland on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee, believed to be worth \u00a31.2 million.[18] Despite this sum he would never start a league game for the \"Black Cats\". Healy made his debut for Sunderland four days later in the League Cup and marked by scoring the winning goal in extra time against Nottingham Forest.[19] Healy also scored in the FA Cup against Blackburn Rovers.[20] Healy scored his first Premier League goal for the club in a 2\u20130 home win against Stoke City on 7 February 2009.[21] He managed to score in every competition that Sunderland were entered into in his first season with the club. He was sent out on loan to Ipswich Town during the winter 2010 transfer window along with teammate Daryl Murphy.[22] He made his debut against Middlesbrough on 6 February 2010, helping Ipswich to earn a point by setting up Murphy to score with a cross.[23] He scored his first goal for Ipswich on 24 February 2010, in a 1\u20131 draw with Scunthorpe United, salvaging a point and ending his goal drought by scoring for the first time in over a year.[24] Healy joined Doncaster Rovers on loan in November 2010, to fill the void left by the injured Billy Sharp.[25] He marked his Doncaster debut with a goal, finding the net in a 2\u20131 win over Millwall on 6 November.[26] Doncaster extended Healy's loan spell into a second month.[27]\n\nIn January 2011, Healy signed for Rangers on a six-month deal, with a view to signing a longer contract.[28] Having scored in his Leeds, Fulham, Sunderland, Doncaster and Northern Ireland debuts, he also marked his first Rangers appearance with a goal, coming off the bench to add the final goal of a 6\u20130 win over Motherwell on 12 February.[29] Upon the expiry of his contract he signed a new one-year deal with the club, tying him to the Ibrox club until the end of the 2011\u201312 season.[30] On 2 January 2012, Healy scored his second goal for the club, again against Motherwell, with the opener of a 3\u20130 win.[31] His third goal for the club came the following week, when he scored the first of a 4\u20130 victory over Arbroath in the Scottish Cup.[32] He netted his third league goal of the season for the \"Gers\" in a 4\u20130 win over Hibernian on 28 January,[33] and got his fourth goal in a 4\u20131 victory over Dunfermline Athletic on 11 February.[34] He left Ibrox at the end of the 2011\u201312 season following the expiration of his contract.\n\nHe signed a one-year deal with League One side Bury in August 2012.[35] He had previously been linked with a return to Preston North End,[36] but manager Graham Westley rejected the chance to re-sign the striker after finding that Preston fans still resented Healy for the manner of his departure eight years ago.[37] He made a scoring debut for the \"Shakers\" on 25 August, converting a penalty in a 2\u20132 draw with Coventry City at the Ricoh Arena.[38] He was limited to one goal in his 19 games in the 2012\u201313 campaign as Bury were relegated into League Two. He was one of 16 players released at the end of the season.[39] Unable to find a club after his release and struggling with persistent ankle injuries, Healy announced his retirement from football on 3 December 2013.[40]\n\nOn 31 July 2014, Healy played for Glenavon in a 5\u20130 loss in a pre-season friendly against his former club Leeds United.[41] The match was part of Glenavon's 125th anniversary celebrations.[42]\n\nHe made his d\u00e9but for Northern Ireland on 23 February 2000, putting a brace past Luxembourg. He was still only 20 years old; having made his d\u00e9but for Manchester United the previous October, he had just joined Port Vale on loan. His competitive international d\u00e9but came in September 2000, in a World Cup qualifying game against Malta, and he scored his first competitive goal for his country a month later against Denmark.\n\nOn 6 June 2004, in a friendly game away to Trinidad and Tobago (his 35th international), he scored his 13th and 14th goals for Northern Ireland, thus equalling and overtaking Colin Clarke's record for the country. In September that year, Healy was controversially sent off in Northern Ireland's 2\u20132 draw with Wales. After celebrating the goal he scored to put Northern Ireland 2\u20130 up, he made a hand gesture towards the fans. The referee sent him off but Healy later explained that he was celebrating towards his family and that was how he always celebrated when scoring for his then-club, Preston North End.\n\nOn 7 September 2005, at Windsor Park, Healy secured a famous victory for his country against England in a World Cup qualifier when he scored the only goal of the game. This was his nation's first win over the English since 1972.[11]\n\nHe achieved his 50th cap and 20th international goal against Finland in August 2006, also playing as captain.[11] A month later, on 6 September 2006, Healy became the first man since Colin Clarke to score a hat-trick for Northern Ireland and the first since George Best to do so in Belfast. His three goals gave Northern Ireland a historic 3\u20132 victory over Spain.[11] Healy followed this feat with the winner against Latvia on 11 October 2006.[43] In the following international game, against Liechtenstein, he scored a second hat-trick, thus becoming the first player ever to score two hat-tricks for Northern Ireland.[44]\n\nHe scored both of Northern Ireland's goals in a 2\u20131 win against Sweden on 28 March 2007,[45] and two more against Liechtenstein on 22 August, followed by a penalty away to Iceland on 12 September. On 17 November 2007, when he scored against Denmark, it was his 13th goal in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group F tournament (in eleven games). This made him the highest-ever goalscorer in a UEFA European Championship qualifying campaign. The previous record, of twelve goals in ten games, had been set by Davor \u0160uker of Croatia in 1996. As a result, Healy was presented with the award by Michel Platini, who quoted: \"David Healy's record goes down in history and he beat a world-class striker in Davor Suker to do so. The outstanding performance of David in the qualifying competition of the European Championship and his goal tally of 13 goals is a new record and deserves to be recognised. I am sure that this record will last for some time to come and will be hard to beat. This is why I will be presenting him with a special award to celebrate his fantastic achievement.\"[46]\n\nIn October 2008, Healy received several death threats after he welcomed an international goal he had scored by saying 'the famine is over'. The goal had come after an uncharacteristic drought at the time. Healy's comments were interpreted[by whom?] as a reference to Rangers fans' chant \u2013 \"'the famine is over, why don't you go home?\"\nHealy claimed to be oblivious to the fact that he had offended anyone saying, \"I'm so disappointed and upset that anyone could even try and make this link. And when told about this I was totally bemused.\"[47] Despite finding a new club, Healy was left out of the Northern Ireland squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 2012 by new manager Michael O'Neill.[48] On 14 November 2012, he marked his return to international duty with an equalising goal from the bench against Azerbaijan \u2013 it was his first international goal in four years.[49]\n\nHe won a total of 95 senior caps, making him Northern Ireland's third most capped outfield player [50] and fourth overall in the nation's all-time appearances chart behind goalkeeper Pat Jennings (119), Aaron Hughes (112) and Steve Davis (108). His 36 international goals make him the nation's all-time leading goalscorer by a considerable distance.\n\nHealy was appointed manager of NIFL Premiership side Linfield in October 2015, the club he had supported all his life.[54][55] He steered the \"Blues\" to a second-place finish in 2015\u201316, eight points behind Crusaders. On 7 February 2017, he won his first managerial honour as Linfield beat Crusaders 3\u20131 in the County Antrim Shield.[56] On 25 February, he was given a six-game general ban after being dismissed from the touchline for the third time of the season.[57] Despite this setback, the \"Blues\" went on to win the league title in 2016\u201317, and ended the campaign with a treble after beating Coleraine 3\u20130 in the final of the Irish Cup.[58] He went on to add the Charity Shield to Linfield's honours with a 3\u20131 victory over Coleraine at The Oval.[59] They went on to lose to Celtic in the second round of qualification for the UEFA Champions League in the 2017\u201318 season, and had a disappointing campaign domestically as they finished fourth in the league and exited both cup competitions at the quarter-finals. On 16 February 2018, Healy won his fifth domestic honour with Linfield as they won the Northern Irish League Cup final with a 1\u20130 over Ballymena United.[60]\n\nHealy won his second league title as a manager during the 2018\u201319 campaign, with Linfield finishing seven points ahead of second-placed Ballymena United and Healy also being named as Manager of the Year.[61] He also added the League Cup to his collection, as Linfield defeated Ballymena United 1\u20130 in the final.[62] Linfield also reached the 2019 County Antrim Shield final, losing out 4\u20133 to Crusaders.[63] He stated that he was looking to strengthen the first-team in the summer, saying that \"we're not just going to be bringing in players for the sake of making up the numbers, we're going to be bringing in players who will be challenging for a starting berth\".[64]\n\nThe 2019\u201320 season was ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland and Linfield were crowned champions after finishing ahead of Coleraine on points per game.[65] Healy said that it was unfortunate that they were unable to secure the title on the pitch but was pleased that they were \"rightly crowned champions\".[66]\n\nLinfield retained the league title in the 2020\u201321 campaign and on 21 May, Healy won his second Irish Cup when his Linfield side defeated Larne 2\u20131.[67] He was linked with a move to Irish club Dundalk and stated that \"I certainly don't want outstay my welcome [at Linfield]\".[68][69] Healy was also named as the NI Football Awards manager of the year for the third time.[70]\n\nDespite securing a fourth consecutive title at the end of the 2021\u201322 season, Healy stated that he had \"never quite won the supporters over\" and that online abuse was starting to affect his family.[71][72] He was named as Manager of the Year for the fourth time at the annual Northern Ireland Football Awards.[73]\n\nLinfield came close to becoming the first Northern Irish team to qualify for the group stages of a European competition when they took FK RFS of Latvia to a penalty shoot-out in the play-offs for the UEFA Europa Conference League on 25 August 2022.[74] Linfield won the 2022\u201323 edition of the Northern Ireland Football League Cup, beating Coleraine 2\u20130 in the final.[75]\n\nHealy is married to Emma and they have three children: daughters Taylor and Taluulah, and son Jude.[76] He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours for services to football.[77]\n\nRangers\n\nIndividual\n\nLinfield\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Healy_(footballer)"}, {"id": 201, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/97/1933977/original/roman-pavlyuchenko-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Roman Pavlyuchenko", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/roman-pavlyuchenko/1933977", "desc": "Roman Anatolyevich Pavlyuchenko (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e; born 15 December 1981) is a Russian footballer who plays as a striker for FC Znamya Noginsk.\nHe started his career at Dynamo Stavropol, and Rotor Volgograd, before transferring to Spartak Moscow in 2003.

Pavlyuchenko began his football career when he joined Victory Sports School and stayed there for seven years before joining another youth club, Dynamo Stavropol.\n\nPavlyuchenko started his football career at Dynamo Stavropol.

But under Fyodor Gagloyev, he was first invited to join pre-season tour with the club.

In his second season, Pavlyuchenko made 26 appearances and scored 10 goals which once again he was the most effective player on the team, which took eighth place in the league. In his third season, Pavlyuchenko made 25 appearances and scored 11.\n\nIn his fourth season, Pavlyuchenko was the top scorer in the league with 18 goals and the first player to do so at Spartak Moscow. This also became the first player in the history of Spartak, who was tournament top scorer after the creation of the Russian Federation in 1992. The club was also close to winning the league but lost out to CSKA Moscow having the same points but with an inferior goal difference. In his fifth season, Pavlyuchenko became a top scorer with 14 goals along with Roman Adamov. With Spartak Moscow he qualified for the UEFA Champions League. Pavlyuchenko was the hero when he scored the winning goal and provided an assist for Mozart in a 2\u20131 win over Slovan Liberec in the second leg of Champions League Qualification following a first leg 0\u20130 draw. That win would secure the club Champions League status as Spartak Moscow would play in the Group Stage and were drawn against Sporting Clube de Portugal, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan. On 18 October 2006, Pavlyuchenko scored the only goal in a 2\u20131 loss against Inter Milan Matchday 3. On 5 December 2006 Matchday 6, Pavlyuchenko scored the first goal in the game as Spartak Moscow win 3\u20131 over Sporting Lisbon. This win ensured Spartak Moscow would go to the UEFA Cup after becoming third in the group stage. The following season Spartak faced Celtic in their UEFA Champions League qualifier. The first leg finished 1-1, with Pavlyuchenko scoring Spartak's goal.[5] The second leg also finished 1\u20131 with Pavlyuchenko scoring again, though he also missed a penalty in normal time. The game went to penalties and Spartak lost.[6] On 19 April 2007, Pavlyuchenko scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 3\u20130 win over Kuban Krasnodar. In his fourth and last season, Pavlyuchenko made 14 appearances and scored 6.\n\nDuring his time at Spartak, Pavlyuchenko was the club's most prolific goalscorer, scoring 69 goals in 141 games. His goalscoring, together with his loyalty to the rhombik (the club's emblem), earned him much respect and appreciation from the \"Army of Red-White Fans\".\n\nIn September 2008, Pavlyuchenko signed for Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a313.7\u00a0million.[7]\n\nPavlyuchenko made his debut for Spurs on 15 September against Aston Villa.[8] He scored his first goal on 24 September 2008, in the 2\u20131 League Cup 3rd round win against Newcastle United.[9] Pavlyuchenko went on to score his first league goal for the club in the 2\u20130 victory against Bolton Wanderers on 26 October 2008.[10] On 16 May 2009 in a 2\u20131 win over Manchester City, Pavlyuchenko was substituted 15 minutes before full-time for Fraizer Campbell. Unhappy at coming off, Pavlyuchenko stormed down the tunnel rather joining his teammates on the bench. His actions were criticised by Harry Redknapp, saying that he let the players and fans down.\n\n\"I don't like that, It's not something I like. You're looking to scrap away. The fans are here and paying their money to watch and I think when a player runs down the tunnel without sitting down and watching and getting behind the team, I think that is disrespectful to his team-mates\n Pavlyuchenko then apologised for his actions, saying it wasn't his best performance and was angry at himself after coming off the pitch and not at the decision to replace him.[12]\n\nHe has scored in every English domestic cup competition game he has played in, except for the 2009 Football League Cup Final. In the 2009\u201310 season, Pavlyuchenko was fourth-choice striker for Tottenham, with Harry Redknapp preferring Robbie Keane, Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe to the Russian which Pavlyuchenko was linked a move away from the club.[citation needed] Pavlyuchenko has been linked with clubs like Lokomotiv Moscow,[13] Zenit Saint Petersburg,[14] Roma,[15] A.C. Milan,[16] Hertha BSC,[17] Birmingham City,[18] West Ham United[citation needed] and Spartak Moscow.[19] However, Pavlyuchenko says that he cannot understand why the club didn't let him leave the club, without any explanation.[20]\n\nPavlyuchenko came on as a substitute on 21 February against Wigan Athletic and scored his first league goal of the season, a close-range finish to make the score 2\u20130. He also added a second from a very tight angle during injury time to make it 3\u20130. Harry Redknapp acknowledged the importance of his performance and remarked on Pavlyuchenko's popularity with the fans in his post-match interview.[21] He made his second start of the season three days later in the FA Cup fifth-round replay against Bolton Wanderers and scored twice, a match Tottenham won 4\u20130. Redknapp has since gone on to say that the Russian striker has taken his opportunity and may well see further first team action.[22] Pavlyuchenko continued his good form with another goal against Everton on 28 February, and another two goals against Blackburn Rovers on 13 March. He also scored a goal in the quarter-final replay against Fulham at White Hart Lane on 24 March.\n\nOn 17 August, he scored a vital away goal against BSC Young Boys in the Champions League play-off round first leg. Tottenham were losing 3\u20130 until a S\u00e9bastien Bassong header pulled it back to 3\u20131 and Pavlyuchenko later made it 3\u20132. In the second leg, Spurs won 4\u20130 at home, meaning that they would progress into the Champions League group stages. Pavlyuchenko's promising form in this tournament continued with two second-half penalty strikes against FC Twente in Tottenham's second group match, followed by a decisive third goal as Spurs beat cup holders Inter Milan on Matchday 4. On 4 November, Pavlyuchenko scored with a volley in a 4\u20132 defeat to Bolton Wanderers. The following weekend, he scored again in a home win against Blackburn Rovers. On 6 March 2011, he scored a goal against Wolves. He scored the first goal against West Bromwich Albion on 2\u20132 draw on April. Pavlyuchenko scored a goal in a London derby against Chelsea in a 1\u20131 draw. On 22 May, the final day of the season, Pavlyuchenko scored two stunning long-range goals in a 2\u20131 win against Birmingham City to ensure that Tottenham finished fifth in the Premier League and qualified for the 2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League. The win also relegated Birmingham to the Championship.[23]\n\nThe Russian's Tottenham career up until this point had consisted of constantly being down the pecking order in the 2009\u201310 season despite having a better goals per minute ratio than all of his fellow strike partners in Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch and Robbie Keane. The same went for the 2010\u201311 season when in March Pavlyuchenko had a minutes per goals ratio of 151 compared to competitors Jermain Defoe who had 208, Peter Crouch had 243 and Rafael van der Vaart had 161.[24] On 22 May 2011, Pavlyuchenko scored a brace against Birmingham City, to relegate them to the EFL Championship, on the 38th Match Day.   In December of the 2011\u201312 season, the striker had been restricted to just 18 minutes of Premier League football, until he came on against Sunderland and went on to score the only goal of the game in the 61st minute.[25] This was his third goal of the season having scored against Shamrock Rovers and Rubin Kazan in the Europa League earlier in the season.\n\nIn early 2012, Tottenham unilaterally invoked an option to extend Pavlyuchenko's contract until the end of next season.[26] Reports claim that Pavlyuchenko had been involved in a training ground bust-up with Spurs coach Kevin Bond which led him to leave the club in the January transfer window. This was later refuted by his agent.[27] On the transfer deadline, Pavlyuchenko signed a deal with Lokomotiv Moscow for a fee of \u00a38 million with Louis Saha as his replacement.[28] On 3 March 2012, Pavlyuchenko made his debut in his first match back at Russia since 2008 against Kuban Krasnodar in a 2\u20130 win.[29] On 24 March 2012, Pavlyuchenko scored his first goal in over four years in Russia in a 2\u20130 win over CSKA Moscow and provided an assist for Felipe Caicedo.[30] After starting first 6 games of the 2012\u201313 season under the new manager Slaven Bili\u0107, he lost his spot in the starting lineup and was intermittently used as a substitute for the rest of the season. In the 2013\u201314 season, there was again a change of manager in Lokomotiv, but Pavlyuchenko was still used as a substitute by Leonid Kuchuk.\n\nOn 16 July 2015, Kuban Krasnodar announced the signing of Pavlyuchenko. He reunited with former Russia teammate Andrei Arshavin.[31]\n\nOn 25 June 2016, following Kuban's relegation, he signed a one-year deal with FC Ural Yekaterinburg.[32]\n\nOn 30 May 2017, he signed with FC Ararat Moscow and played with the new club in the Russian Professional Football League (third-level).[33] On 17 November 2017, his Ararat contract was dissolved by mutual consent.[34]\n\nOn 31 August 2018, he joined the fourth-tier Russian Amateur Football League side FC Znamya Noginsk. He announced he will be with the team on part-time basis and play only in home games.[35] He then returned to Ararat for 3 months in 2019 and then back to Znamya, both at amateur fourth-tier. As Znamya was promoted to Russian Professional Football League for the 2020\u201321 season, he returned to professional-level football at the age of 38. He was joined at Znamya by former Russian internationals Aleksandr Samedov, Renat Yanbayev and Aleksandr Sheshukov. On 21 August 2021, he scored 4 goals in a 5\u20133 victory over FC Kolomna which was the first time he scored 4 goals in a competitive game in his career.[36] On 19 October 2022 in a game against FC Kosmos Dolgoprudny, Pavlyuchenko was sent off after trying to fight an opponent and swearing at him. Russian Football Union banned him for 8 games for his conduct.[37] Following that, Pavlyuchenko announced his retirement from playing.[38]\n\nPavlyuchenko made his debut for the Russian national team on 20 August 2003, replacing Dmitriy Sychev at half-time of a 3\u20131 friendly loss to Israel at Lokomotiv Stadium in Moscow. He did not play again until 3 September 2005, when he started in a 2\u20130 home win over Liechtenstein in World Cup qualification. He scored his first goal on his third cap on 8 October, the third in a 5\u20131 win over Luxembourg in World Cup qualification, four minutes after coming on for Andrey Arshavin.[39]\n\nRoman Pavlyuchenko was in the spotlight when he scored both goals in Russia's 2\u20131 victory in a crucial Euro 2008 qualification match against England.[40] He was named in Guus Hiddink's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2008,[41] and scored in warm-up victories against Serbia and Lithuania.[39]\n\nHe scored a late consolation goal in Russia's loss to Spain in their opening match of the campaign and the first goal in Russia's third match of the tournament against Sweden to send Russia through at Sweden's expense.[42][43] He was declared man of the match after the 1\u20130 game with Greece,[44] although he did not score in the game, and then scored the first goal of the match in Russia's 3\u20131 quarter final victory over the Netherlands.[45] After the tournament ended, he was named in the 23-man Team of the Tournament.[46]\n\nPavlyuchenko scored his first international hat-trick on 4 June 2011 in a European qualifier against Armenia in Saint Petersburg.\n\nHe was confirmed for the finalized UEFA Euro 2012 squad on 25 May 2012. In their opening match against the Czech Republic on 8 June in Wroclaw, he came off the bench in the 73rd minute and set up his teammate Alan Dzagoev for Russia's third goal. Minutes later he scored Russia's fourth goal, and Russia went on to win 4\u20131.[47]\n[48] Pavlyuchenko come on as a substitute against Poland (1-1) and Greece (0-1), which caused the team to be eliminated from the group.\n\nOn 24 July 2013, Pavlyuchenko announced his retirement from international duty.[3][49][50]\n\nPavlyuchenko has Ukrainian ancestry and he is married to Larisa and has a young daughter named Kristina. In Russia, Pavlyuchenko is a local Duma (city council) deputy in Stavropol, representing the ruling Vladimir Putin-led United Russia party,[51] although \"because of my profession it won't be easy for me to take part directly in the workings of the city council \u2013 but I am ready to help with advice and with a concrete contribution to the development possibilities for exercise and sport\".[52]\n\nSpartak Moscow\n\nLokomotiv Moscow\n\nRussia\n\nIndividual\n\n(* Jointly shared with Roman Adamov)\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Pavlyuchenko"}, {"id": 202, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/2251/45012710/original/anwar-ali-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Anwar Ali", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/anwar-ali/45012710", "desc": "Anwar Ali is an Indian footballer, currently playing for  Minerva Punjab FC in the I-League as a centre back.\n\n", "full_desc": "Anwar Ali may refer to:\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Ali_(footballer)"}, {"id": 203, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/54/1060951/original/george-weah-photo-u9?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "George Weah", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/george-weah/1060951", "desc": "George Manneh Oppong Weah (; born 1 October 1966) is a Liberian politician and former professional footballer currently serving as the 25th President of Liberia, in office since 2018.

Prior to his election to the presidency, Weah served as Senator from Montserrado County. He played as a striker in his prolific 18-year professional football career, which ended in 2003.[6] He is the first African former professional footballer to become a head of state.[7]\n\nAfter beginning his career in his native Liberia, Weah spent 14 years playing for clubs in France, Italy and England. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger first brought him to Europe, signing him for Monaco in 1988. Weah moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 1992 where they won the Ligue 1 in 1994 and became the top scorer of the 1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League. He signed for AC Milan in 1995 where he spent four successful seasons, winning the Serie A twice.[8] He moved to the Premier League towards the end of his career and had spells at Chelsea and Manchester City, winning the FA Cup at the former, before returning to France to play for Marseille in 2001. He ended his career with Al Jazira in 2003. FourFourTwo named Weah one of the best players never to win the UEFA Champions League.[9]\n\nWeah represented Liberia at the international level, winning 75 caps and scoring 18 goals for his country and playing at the African Cup of Nations on two occasions. He also played an international friendly in 2018, where his number 14 jersey was retired. Regarded as one of the best players never to have played at the World Cup,[10][11] Scott Murray in The Guardian refers to Weah as \"hamstrung by hailing from a global minnow\".[12]\n\nWidely regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time, in 1995, Weah was named FIFA World Player of the Year and won the Ballon d'Or, becoming the first and only player to win these awards while representing an African country internationally. In 1989, 1994 and 1995, he was also named the African Footballer of the Year, and in 1996, he was named African Player of the Century. Known for his acceleration, speed, and dribbling ability, in addition to his goalscoring and finishing, Weah was described by FIFA as \"the precursor of the multi-functional strikers of today\".[13] In 2004, he was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[14]\n\nWeah became involved in politics in Liberia following his retirement from football. He formed the Congress for Democratic Change and ran unsuccessfully for president in the 2005 election, losing to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in the second round of voting. In the 2011 election, he ran unsuccessfully for vice president alongside Winston Tubman. Weah was subsequently elected to the Liberian Senate for Montserrado County in the 2014 elections. Weah was elected President of Liberia in the 2017 election, defeating the incumbent vice president Joseph Boakai[15][16] and was sworn in on 22 January 2018.[17]\n\nWeah was born and raised in the Clara Town district of Monrovia.[18] He is a member of the Kru ethnic group, which hail from south-eastern Liberia's Grand Kru County, one of the poorest areas of the country.[19][self-published source] His father, William T. Weah Sr.,[20] was a mechanic[21] while his mother, Anna Quayeweah (d. 2013),[22] was a seller.[21] He has three brothers, William, Moses and Wolo.[22] He was one of thirteen children largely raised by his devoutly Christian paternal grandmother,[21][18] Emma Klonjlaleh Brown after his parents separated[18] when George was still a baby.[21] He attended middle school at Muslim Congress and high school at Wells Hairston High School, and reportedly dropped out in his final year of studies.[23] He began to play football for the Young Survivors youth club at the age of 15 and later moved to other local football clubs, assuming starring roles for Mighty Barrolle and Invicible Eleven.[18] Before his football career allowed him to move abroad, Weah worked for the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation as a switchboard technician.[19]\n\nWeah was a real surprise. I have never seen any player explode on to the scene like he did.\n\n\u2014Ars\u00e8ne Wenger[24]\n\nAfter playing in the Liberian domestic league at the beginning of his successful career and winning several national honors (including the Liberian Premier League and the Liberian Cup),[24] Weah's abilities were discovered by the Cameroon national team coach, Claude Le Roy, who relayed the news to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Weah moved to Europe in 1988, for just \u00a312,000 from Cameroonian club Tonnerre Yaound\u00e9,[25][26] when he was signed by Wenger[27] \u2013 the manager of Monaco at the time \u2013 who flew to Africa himself prior to the signing,[18] and whom Weah credits as an important influence on his career.[28] During his time with Monaco, Weah won the African Footballer of the Year for the first time in 1989; this was his first major award and he took it back home for the entire country to celebrate.[24] Weah also won the Coupe de France in 1991, and he helped Monaco reach the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1992, scoring four goals in nine cup appearances.\n\nWeah subsequently played for Paris Saint-Germain (1992\u201395), with whom he won the Coupe de France in 1993 and 1995, the French league in 1994, and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1995 during a highly prolific and successful period; he also became the top scorer of the 1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League, with seven goals, after reaching the semi-finals with the club, one of which was a skilful individual \"wonder-goal\" against Bayern Munich in the group stage, on 23 November 1994.[24][29] During his time at the club, he also managed to reach the semi-finals of the 1992\u201393 UEFA Cup, and the semi-finals of the 1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup; in total, he scored 16 goals in 25 European games.[24] In 1994, he won the African Footballer of the Year Award for the second time in his career.[24]\n\nWeah joined AC Milan in 1995, with whom he immediately won the Italian league in 1996 under Fabio Capello, playing alongside Roberto Baggio and Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107 in Milan's attack, as well as Marco Simone, on occasion, and finishing the season as Milan's top goalscorer; he won the Serie A title once again in 1999. During his time with the club, he also reached the 1998 Coppa Italia final, and finished as runner-up in the Supercoppa Italiana on two occasions, in 1996 and 1999.[8] Despite their European dominance in the early 1990s, Milan were less successful in Europe during this time, however, with their best result being a quarter-final finish in the 1995\u201396 UEFA Cup.\n\nExhibiting skill, athleticism and goalscoring prowess, Weah became famous at Milan for scoring several notable goals, in particular a solo goal against Hellas Verona at the San Siro which saw him deftly control the ball from Verona's corner kick just outside his own penalty area, before he set off.[30] With all his teammates back defending the corner Weah made a beeline for goal, leaving his own teammates in his wake.[30] His teammate Zvonimir Boban stated, \"It was an incredible run. We were thinking, 'When's he going to stop? When's he going to stop? He's not going to stop! He's never going to stop!'\".[30] Weah finished by rifling the ball into the bottom left corner before an exuberant goal celebration.[24][31]\n\nDue to his performances with both Paris Saint-Germain and Milan, in 1995 Weah was the recipient of several individual awards: he won the Ballon d'Or, the Onze d'Or, and was named FIFA World Player of the Year, becoming the first and, currently, only African player (by FIFA nationality) to win these awards, and second African-born player to do so after Eus\u00e9bio.  Weah dedicated his FIFA World Player of the Year victory to his former manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, stating that it was thanks to him that he was able to develop into a world class player.[32] That year, Weah also won the African Player of the Year Award for the third time in his career, and was named to the Onze de Onze by the French football magazine Onze Mondial.[24] In 1996, Weah finished second in the FIFA World Player of the Year ranking; he was also the recipient of the FIFA Fair Play Award, and was voted the African Player of the Century by sport journalists from around the world.[24]\n\nWeah was banned from six European matches for breaking the nose of the Portuguese defender Jorge Costa on 20 November 1996 in the players' tunnel after Milan's draw at Porto in the Champions League. Weah said he exploded in frustration after putting up with racist tauntings from Costa during both of the teams' Champions League matches that autumn. Costa strenuously denied the accusations of racism and was not charged by UEFA as no witnesses could verify Weah's allegations, not even his Milan teammates. Weah later attempted to apologize to Costa but this was rebuffed by the Portuguese, who considered the charges of racist insults leveled against him to be defamatory and took Weah to court.[33] The incident led to Costa undergoing facial surgery and he was subsequently sidelined for three weeks. Despite the incident, Weah still received the FIFA Fair Play Award in 1996.[34]\n\nThe most astonishing thing about Weah is that genius on the field and generosity off it come in equal measure. He personally bankrolls his national team. Paying for players to travel to matches, supplying kit, and even offering win bonuses have amounted to tens of thousands of dollars so far. He is his country's best-known ambassador. Back home, they call him King George and adore him so much they wish he will one day become president.\n\n\u2014Amy Lawrence of The Guardian, writing in April 2000.[25]\n\nWeah signed for Premier League club Chelsea on loan from Milan on 11 January 2000, in a deal which would keep him with the West London club until the end of the 1999\u20132000 English season.[35] Although past his prime, Weah's time in England was deemed a success, especially at Chelsea where he instantly endeared himself to their fans by scoring the winner against rivals Tottenham Hotspur on his debut,[36] and scored further league goals against Wimbledon[37] and Liverpool.[38] He also scored twice in Chelsea's victorious 1999\u20132000 FA Cup netting crucial goals against Leicester City[39] and Gillingham.[40] This led to him starting in the final, which Chelsea won 1\u20130.[41]\n\nChelsea manager Gianluca Vialli did not make Weah's move permanent, and, on 1 August 2000, he officially left Milan, and signed for newly promoted Premier League side Manchester City on a free transfer on a two-year contract worth \u00a330,000 a week,[42] declining the offer of a \u00a31\u00a0million pay-off from Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi.[43] He played 11 games in all competitions for City, scoring four times, before leaving on 16 October 2000 after becoming dissatisfied with manager Joe Royle for selecting him as a substitute too frequently; he had only played the full 90 minutes in three of his 11 games for the Maine Road club.[44] At City, he scored once in the league against Liverpool (as he did at Chelsea),[45] and three times against Gillingham (again as he had at Chelsea), this time in the League Cup; once in the first leg[46] and twice in the second.[47]\n\nFollowing his time in England, Weah returned to France and had a spell at Marseille, where he remained until May 2001. He later played with Al-Jazira in the UAE Pro-League, where he remained until his retirement as a player in 2003, at age 37.[24] He had planned on joining the New York/New Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer, but elected to join Al-Jazira on a temporary basis.[48]\n\nSince making his debut for the Liberia national team against Sierra Leone in 1986, Weah played 75 games over 20 years, scoring 18 goals.[49] Representing one of the smaller nations in world football and perennial underdogs, Weah did much to support the national squad: aside from being the team's star player, he also later coached the squad and even funded his national side to a large extent. Despite his efforts, he was unsuccessful in helping Liberia qualify for a single FIFA World Cup, falling just a point short in qualifying for the 2002 tournament. However, he did help Liberia to qualify for the African Cup of Nations on two occasions: Weah represented his country in the 1996 and 2002 editions of the tournament, although Liberia failed to make it out of their group both times, suffering first-round eliminations.[24]\n\nWeah has been named by several media outlets as one of the best players to never play at the World Cup.[10][12][50]\n\nOne of the greatest African players of all time, George Weah was, like his namesake George Best before him, hamstrung in World Cup terms by hailing from a global minnow.\nWeah returned to the national team for a specially arranged friendly against Nigeria on 11 September 2018, his final international appearance, playing at the age of 51 while in office as the country's president. His number 14 shirt, worn at his playing peak, was retired after the friendly, with Weah receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted.[51]\n\nAn exceptional goalscorer, it is no exaggeration to describe him as the precursor of the multi-functional strikers of today. Quick, skillful and boasting a powerful physique, fierce shooting power and deadly finishing skills, in his pomp Liberia's 'Mr George' was rightly considered one of the giants of the game.\n\n\u2014FIFA profile of George Weah.[13]\n\nDuring his prime in the 1990s, Weah was regarded as one of the best strikers in the world. He was lauded for his speed, work-rate, stamina, and attacking instincts, as well as his physical and athletic attributes, which he combined with his finishing, technical ability and creativity.[13][52] A fast, powerful, physically strong player, with an eye for goal, many observers agree that he successfully filled the void left in the Milan attack by club great Marco van Basten.[8][13][25][53] In addition to his pace, acceleration, dribbling skills, and goalscoring ability, as a multi-functional forward Weah was also a team player who was capable of creating chances and assisting goals for teammates.[54][55]\nAlong with Ronaldo and Rom\u00e1rio, Weah was viewed as a modern, new style of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area and run with the ball towards goal, at a time when strikers primarily operated inside the penalty area where they would receive the ball from teammates.[13][56][57] Among the next generation of strikers who were inspired, Thierry Henry states, \"George Weah, Rom\u00e1rio, and Ronaldo changed the game for me. It was the first time as a striker I saw players that could score on their own. Pick the ball up anywhere and score. Before as a number nine, people would say \u2018stay within the line of the box, don\u2019t move too much, don\u2019t go to the wings, don\u2019t drop, stay.\u2019 Then I saw George Weah. And then I saw Ronaldo. And I saw Rom\u00e1rio in a different way before those two. And it was like \u2018hang on a minute, someone has lied to me\u2019.\"[58]\n\nOne such goal that exemplified this ability was against Verona in 1995 where he received the ball in the edge of his own penalty box and ran the length of the field.[25] Scoring such a goal in Serie A \u2013 the best defensive league in the world \u2013 saw media outlets such as Gazzetta dello Sport running pages of analysis for days afterwards, and calling it the greatest strike of all in Italian football.[25] On his impact on the sport, Weah states, \"When I look at my idols \u2013 Pel\u00e9, Maradona, Beckenbauer, Cruyff \u2013 they did a lot of great things. I came into the game and made history too.\"[25]\n\nThe best player on the planet, at his peak in 1995 he reigned as world, African and European footballer of the year, a trio of crowns never worn simultaneously before or since.\n\n\u2014 Amy Lawrence in The Guardian on The wonder of Weah.[25]\n\nNamed African Footballer of the Year three times and the first African to win the Ballon d'Or and be named FIFA World Player of the Year, Weah's prominence in the 1990s led him to be nicknamed \"King George\". Regarded as one of the greatest African footballers of all time,[12][59] Weah was named African Player of the Century in 1996,[60] and is usually ranked among the three greatest African strikers ever, alongside Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o.[61][62] In 2013, Milan great Franco Baresi named Weah in the greatest XI he has ever played with.[63] FourFourTwo magazine named Weah one of the best players never to win the UEFA Champions League.[9] A number of publications, including Scott Murray of The Guardian and Kevin Baxter of the Los Angeles Times, in addition to FIFA, consider him to be one of the greatest players never to feature at the World Cup.[10][11][12]\n\nThe status of Weah in the sport saw him feature in EA Sports' FIFA video game series where he was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in FIFA 14.[64] During his playing career Weah was sponsored by sportswear company Diadora, and he became famous for his red Diadora boots while playing for AC Milan.[65]\n\nMighty Barrolle\n\nInvincible Eleven\n\nMonaco\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nAC Milan\n\nChelsea\n\nLiberia\n\nIndividual\n\nWeah is a devoted humanitarian for his war-torn country. During his playing career he became a UN Goodwill Ambassador.[94] At the 2004 ESPY Awards at the Kodak Theatre, Los Angeles, Weah won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award for his efforts.[95] He has also been named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador,[96] a role which he has suspended in his political career.[97] Off the football pitch, he stood out throughout his career for his initiatives to fight against racism in the game.[98]\n\nWeah has tried to use football as a way to bring happiness and promote education for children in Liberia. In 1998, Weah launched a CD called Lively Up Africa featuring the singer Frisbie Omo Isibor and eight other African football stars. The proceeds from this CD went to children's programs in the countries of origin of the athletes involved.[99]\n\nWeah was President of the Junior Professionals, a former football team he founded in Monrovia in 1994. As a way to encourage young people to remain in school, the club's only requirement for membership was school attendance. Many of the young people, recruited from all over Liberia, went on to play for the Liberian national team.[100] Weah was also actively involved with youth programs in a Liberian enclave on Staten Island, New York, when he resided there for a time.[101]\n\nThe Diya Group chairman and Indian entrepreneur Nirav Tripathi announced a multimillion-dollar partnership with Weah in 2016, whereby global football academies would be established to help assist youth in both impoverished and emerging nations.[102]\n\nThe motivation for the academies is cited as a shared experience between both Tripathi and Weah in how sport can transform lives in their nations of India and Liberia, which both still suffer from severe poverty.[102]\n\nFollowing the end of the Second Liberian Civil War, Weah announced his intention to run for President of Liberia in the 2005 elections, forming the Congress for Democratic Change to back his candidacy. While Weah was a popular figure in Liberia, opponents cited his lack of formal education as a handicap to his ability to lead the country, in contrast with his Harvard-educated opponent, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Analysts also noted Weah's lack of experience, calling him a \"babe-in-the-woods\", while Sirleaf had served as minister of finance in the Tolbert administration in the 1970s and had held positions at Citibank, the World Bank and the United Nations. Weah's eligibility to run for presidency was also called into question as it was reported that he had become a French citizen in his footballing career at Paris St. Germain, but these complaints were rebuffed by the electoral commission in court and Weah was allowed to proceed.[103]\n\nWeah obtained a plurality of votes in the first round of voting on 11 October, garnering 28.3% of the vote. This qualified him to compete in a run-off election against Sirleaf, the second placed candidate. However, he lost the run-off to Sirleaf on 8 November, garnering only 40.6% to 59.4% for Sirleaf. Weah alleged that the election had been rigged through voter intimidation and ballot tampering, and many of his supporters protested the results in the streets of Monrovia. However, after assurances that the vote was fair, several prominent African leaders called on Weah's supporters to accept the result with grace and dignity, and Sirleaf became president. The African Union had characterized the elections as \"peaceful, transparent, and fair\".[104]\n\nWeah's lack of education became a campaign issue. He has been highly critical of those who say he is not fit to govern: \"With all their education and experience, they have governed this nation for hundreds of years. They have never done anything for the nation.\" He initially claimed to have a BA degree in Sports Management from Parkwood University in London; however, this is an unaccredited diploma mill, which awards certificates without requiring study.[105] Weah then pursued a degree in business administration at DeVry University in Miami.[106][107]\n\nWeah also remained active in Liberian politics, returning from the United States in 2009 to successfully campaign for the Congress for Democratic Change candidate in the Montserrado County senatorial by-election.[108] Some analysts saw these moves as preparation for a repeat run for the Presidency in 2011,[109] and Weah did indeed later announce his intention to challenge Sirleaf in the 2011 election.[110] After a series of failed alliances with other opposition parties, the Congress for Democratic Change chose Weah as its 2011 vice presidential candidate, running with presidential candidate Winston Tubman.[111] However, Sirleaf was re-elected, with the Tubman / Weah ticket receiving only 9.3% of the vote.\n\nIn 2014, he ran for election to the Senate as a Congress for Democratic Change candidate in Montserrado County. He was overwhelmingly elected to the Liberian Senate on 20 December 2014. Weah defeated Robert Sirleaf, the son of President Sirleaf, becoming the first Liberian international athlete elected to represent a county in the Legislature. He won a landslide victory, receiving 99,226 votes, which represented 78.0% of the total votes from the 141 polling centers, while Sirleaf, his closest rival received 13,692 votes, which is nearly 11% in the election marred only by a low turnout.[112][113] Following his election, Weah only occasionally attended sessions of the Senate and did not introduce or sponsor any legislation.[114]\n\nIn April 2016, Weah announced his intention to run for President of Liberia in the 2017 elections,[94] standing for the Coalition for Democratic Change. After winning the first round of the 2017 election with 38.4% of the vote, he and Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party went into the second round of the election. In the second round, Weah was elected President of Liberia, winning a run-off against Vice President Joseph Boakai with more than 60% of the vote.[115]\n\nWeah was sworn in as president on 22 January 2018, making him the fourth youngest-serving president in Africa,[116] marking Liberia's first democratic transition in 74 years.[117] He cited fighting corruption, reforming the economy, combating illiteracy and improving life conditions as the main targets of his presidency.[117] Two other world class African strikers, Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto'o, attended the inauguration.[118]\n\nOn 29 January 2018, in his first annual message to the national legislature, he reduced his salary and other benefits by 25% with immediate effect. \"With the assessment that I gave you earlier of the poor condition of our economy, I believe that it is appropriate that we should all make sacrifices in the interest of our country. According to Article 60 of the Constitution, the salaries of the President and the Vice President are established by the Legislature, and cannot be increased or reduced during the period for which they are elected. However, in view of the very rapidly deteriorating situation of the economy, I am informing you today, with immediate effect, that I will reduce my salary and benefits by 25% and give the proceeds back to the Consolidated Fund for allocation and appropriation as they see fit.\"[119]\n\nOn 29 January 2018, Weah announced he would seek constitutional changes to allow people of \"non-Negro\" descent to be citizens and allow foreigners to own land. He called the present situation \"racist and inappropriate\".[120]\n\nOn 12 September 2020, he declared a national emergency over sexual violence in the country, pledging to create a special prosecutor for rape, a national sex offender registry, and a national task force to tackle the issue.[121] He further announced a 2 million dollar emergency fund, part of which was used to purchase DNA-testing equipment for forensic identification of perpetrators.[122] However, as of March 2022, the DNA-testing equipment had yet to be made functional.[123] As well, the special prosecutor had yet to be appointed, the sex offender registry had yet to be implemented, and specialized gender-based violence courts had only been implemented in three of the sixteen Liberian counties.[124]\n\nUpon his election to office, Weah first made an official visit in Senegal to meet with President Macky Sall, to \"strengthen the bond between the two countries\". On 21 February 2018, Weah made his first official visit outside Africa, to France, meeting French President Emmanuel Macron. The meeting focused on improving the relationship between France and Liberia and also sought French help for a sports development project in Africa. The meeting was also attended by Didier Drogba, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and FIFA president Gianni Infantino.[125]\nOn 25 May 2018, following a meeting with President Weah, the Liberian Football Association president Musa Bility announced that Liberia would vote for the Canada\u2013Mexico\u2013United States World Cup bid, breaking ranks with the rest of Africa, who were voting for the Moroccan bid.[126]\n\nAs President, Weah has come under criticism for inciting violence on opposition candidates including Telia Urey in 2019.[127] On August 15, 2022, three senior members of Weah's cabinet were sanctioned by the United States for alleged corruption.[128]\n\n\nOn 25 March 2020, the Liberian president recorded his song with the local group The Rabbis, the text of which was written by himself. In this song \"He invites the Liberian and African population to stand up by all means against this virus [SARS-CoV-2] which is causing damage around the world.\"[129][130]\nIt could be your mom, it could be your dad, your brothers or your sisters. Let's all stand together to fight this dirty virus an extract from President Weah's song on a reggae rhythm.\nThe majority of people in Liberia do not have internet or Facebook access, but everyone listens to the radio. The song will be played on various stations across the country to properly broadcast the message, according to the president's spokesperson.[131][132]\n Weah had already recorded a song against Ebola.[131]\n\nWeah has four children; three children with his Jamaican-born[133] wife Clar Weah: George, Tita, and Timothy and a child from another relationship. In 2016, he was sued by the mother of his daughter for child support expenses.[134]\nBoth of his sons became footballers and signed for Paris Saint-Germain,[135] although only Timothy played for the first team.[136] Both played youth internationals for the United States,[137] and Timothy was capped for the senior team.[138]\n\nWeah practiced Islam for ten years before converting back to Christianity.[139] Currently, Weah again practices Protestantism.[140] In October 2017, he was spotted in the prominent Nigerian church of Pastor T.B. Joshua alongside Liberian Senator Prince Yormie Johnson.[141] Joshua was allegedly a key influence in Johnson's decision to endorse Weah's candidacy in the 2017 Liberian elections.[142][143]\n\nHe holds French citizenship and speaks the French language fluently.[144]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Weah"}, {"id": 204, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/645/12889615/original/giannis-maniatis-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Giannis Maniatis", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/giannis-maniatis/12889615", "desc": "Ioannis \"Giannis\" Maniatis (Greek: \u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \"\u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\" \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2; born 12 October 1986) is a Greek professional footballer who plays for Greek club Panionios and the Greek national team", "full_desc": "\n\nGiannis Maniatis (Greek: \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 Greek pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8\u029da.nis ma\u02c8\u0272a.tis]; born 12 October 1986) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a right back or a defensive midfielder.\n\nManiatis was first spotted as a 16-year-old playing for A.A. Arachova Parnassos in 2002. He quickly caught the eye of scouts while finishing his youth career while playing with AO Thiva, and was then snapped up by Panionios in late 2003. He made his debut for the 'Kyanerythri' in 2004 and has since become integral part of the first team. Made 27 league appearances \u2212 all but one in the starting lineup \u2212 in 2006/07, when the club finished fifth and qualified for Europe. Helped Panionios into the group stage of the following season's UEFA Cup after making his European debut in a 2\u20130 win at FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard in the first round. Scored his first Super League goal the following season, against Aris on 18 October 2008, and held his place in the side for the next two years despite a succession of coaching changes.[2]\n\nHe has attracted interest from the big Greek clubs, AEK Athens, Olympiacos and Panathinaikos. However, on 22 June 2009, Maniatis ended speculation over his future by signing a new four-year deal with Panionios.[3]\n\nIn January 2011, Olympiacos won the race for Maniatis' signature, ahead of AEK Athens who showed a strong interest in the player. Maniatis had been acquired as a right-back, where he would be a back-up to the first-choice in that position, team captain Vasilis Torosidis; however, later events would see Maniatis flourish in a new position. His versatility allowed him to play many games for Panionios as a defensive midfielder, a position he would cement himself in at Olympiacos. Olympiacos were plagued with injuries ahead of their UEFA Champions League encounter with Marseille and coach Ernesto Valverde decided to field Maniatis as a defensive midfielder in a tough away game of great importance. Maniatis put in a man-of-the-match performance and has since established himself as a key, first-choice player in midfield for Olympiacos. Maniatis has proven to be more effective in midfield than in what was thought to be his best position at right-back. He has proven to be a revelation at Olympiacos where he has shown great tackling skills, superb stamina and a surprisingly good passing range with impressive vision. Initially being moved into a defensive midfield position, Maniatis now plays as a box-to-box midfielder playing alongside a more established defensive midfielder. He began playing soccer for A.A. Arachova Parnassos  in the lowest division of Greek professional soccer league. Maniatis has overcome a lot of obstacles during his professional career and once said: \"I used to play in front of 10 people in the village of Arahova and a few years later I played in front of 40.000 fans in the Karaiskakis stadium\".[4]\n\nHe scored his first goal at Olympiacos in a 4\u20130 home win against Levadiakos. On 4 December 2012, he managed to score his first goal in the Champions League, in a 2\u20131 home win against Arsenal.\n\nIn the 2014 Greek Cup semi-final between PAOK and Olympiacos, PAOK fans littering the Olympiacos substitutes' bench with anchovies, the match finished with three red cards and fighting between Olympiacos captain Giannis Maniatis and his teammate in the Greece national football team, Kostas Katsouranis. The latter tried to prevent the former from taking a throw-in during the match (or something of the sort). The former, at the best of times, is a slightly ... volatile footballer.[5] A month later in an interview for the 30-man provisional 2014 World Cup squad Kostas Katsouranis admitted his mistake and said that the incident is in the past. \"We talked too much about it. I think that was a mistake from many aspects. And as one of the captain, as second captain or at least one of the two older players in the team, since 2004, I think I have a great responsibility, I was wrong, I explained to Maniatis many times and he understood it and we'll continue as usual to reach our targets\" he said.[6][7][8]\n\nIt was one of the most stable and most valuable players of Olympiakos during the last seasons, and in any case, the 27-year-old cashed his offer champions Greece with a new four-year contract which will tie him with the club till 2017.[9] The 26-year-old has enjoyed a successful move to Piraeus, joining from Panionios in 2011 and since then establishing himself as a key player and breaking into the national team. \"I am proud that I am playing in this team, which is above all a family and I am happy that I will continue to wear red and white. I will give all of my strength to achieve the team's goals, to continue to achieve titles and success and especially to keep our fans proud and happy\". Maniatis said.[10]\n\nOlympiakos's captain Giannis Maniatis on Friday extended his contract with the Greek champions by two years despite being ruled out for four months with a knee injury. The 28-year-old defensive midfielder's contract had been due to expire in the summer of 2017 but that has now been stretched to 2019 by the current Super League leaders. Despite rumours which linked him with a move abroad in the past, Maniatis always had the desire to remain at Olympiakos and he was more than happy to commit his future to the club for the next four years.[11] Maniatis injured his knee in Olympiakos' midweek Greek Cup quarter-final second leg win over AEK Athens which was abandoned in the 89th minute after a pitch invasion by AEK fans. He will be out of action for six months, according to the club's medical team.[12] On 18 December 2015, almost nine months since his severe injury Maniatis, has fully recovered but he could not be able take playing time and according to Greek newspaper Fos, Olympiakos manager Marco Silva will possibly make roster cuts in January and he is in danger. The 29-year-old right back has attracted the interest of Italian and Russian clubs and that the Greek Champions want to let him go on loan until the summer 2016.[13]\n[14] After a very difficult year for the midfielder absent through injury (302 days to be exact), Maniatis returned to action on 7 January 2016, in his first appearance in the 2015\u201316 season where he scored the last goal in a glorious 4\u20131 away win against Chania for the Greek Cup.[15]\n\nOn the beginning of 2016\u201317 season, Maniatis has been informed that was not among the first priorities of the new manager Paulo Bento plans. On 1 September 2016, Maniatis was excluded from Olympiakos's UEFA Europa League squad.[16] On 21 September 2016, Maniatis returned to training however he is still not considered among Paulo Bento's plans. Olympiakos tried to offload Maniatis over the summer but the Greek midfielder did not manage to find a club abroad.[17] After a frustrating six months period for the 2016\u201317 season, the experienced defensive midfielder and captain of Olympiakos is expected to leave the club in January, to continue his career elsewhere, as was not in the plans of Paulo Bento. Still, the 30-year-old international does not seem so intended to join APOEL, which have expressed their interest in signing him on loan until the end of 2016\u201317 season.[18] On 3 February 2017, after a frustrating first half season, Olympiacos officially announced the mutual termination of experienced central midfielder and captain of the club contract.[19]\n\nOn 1 February 2016, he signed a six months contract with Standard Li\u00e8ge on loan from Olympiakos.[20]\nOlympiakos have put a minimum clause fee in the loan move of Maniatis to Standard Li\u00e8ge. Standard Li\u00e8ge completed the loan move of Olympiakos skipper on the transfer deadline day in a loan fee of \u20ac250,000. Olympiakos have included a clause Maniatis contract if the Belgian club wishes to make the move permanent over the summer. The clause is believed to be in the region of \u20ac2 million.[21] On 7 February 2016, he made his debut in Belgian Pro League with a club as a starter in a 1\u20131 home draw against Sint-Truidense V.V. On 10 April 2016, he scored his first goal with the club in a 1\u20131 home draw against Kortrijk.\n\nManiatis was not in Olympiakos' head coach Paulo Bento's plans for the 2016\u20132017 season and after failing to make a single appearance throughout the first half, his contract was mutually terminated in February 2017. Shortly after he signed for the west Athenian club Atromitos on a free transfer for the remainder of the season, with an optional extension clause until June 2018. On 12 May 2017, the experienced central midfielder will not continue his career at Atromitos.[22]\n\nOn 29 June 2017, Maniatis signed a 2-year contract with Turkish S\u00fcper Lig club Alanyaspor for an undisclosed fee. Maniatis argued, in his official club presentation, that he was happy to have come to Alanyaspor and he said, \"I will do what is best in the direction of our goals, I hope that I will be useful to Alanyaspor\". In the Turkish club, he will meet again with his teammate at Greece national football team, Georgios Tzavellas.[23] Since the beginning of January 2018, he was suffered an injury being unable to help his club in the effort to stay in S\u00fcper Lig. On 8 April 2018, he returned to the squad in a 3\u20131 home win game against Akhisarspor. On 1 September 2018, he scored his first goal with the club after Efecan Karaca's assist sealing a 1\u20130 home win game against G\u00f6ztepe S.K.[24]\n\nOn 8 February 2019, after eight years away, Giannis Maniatis returned to Panionios, signing a contract with the Nea Smyrni club after being released from Alanyaspor over the winter transfer window.[25] On 29 June 2019, Panionios announced the renewal of the contract with Maniatis until the summer of 2021 with an undisclosed fee.[26] On 13 November 2019, after a rather mediocre for the player season, in addition to an episode with team manager Nikodimos Papavasiliou, resulted in mutual termination of his contract.[27]\n\nAfter his impressive performances at Panionios, Maniatis was called up to the Greece national football team on 11 August 2010 by Fernando Santos to face Serbia where he made his debut coming on as a substitute in Greece's 0\u20131 away win. Maniatis made his second cap for Greece in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Israel. Played all four games of Greece's UEFA EURO 2012 campaign, which ended at the hands of Germany in the quarter-finals.[28]\nManiatis exceptional season year with Olympiakos was his passport not only to be called by Santos to the 30-man provisional World Cup squad, but also to the final 23-man squad for 2014 FIFA World Cup.[29]\n\nAfter the 3\u20130 defeat from Colombia in the opening game of FIFA World Cup 2014, Maniatis lashed out at fellow defender Georgios Tzavellas over the quality of crosses the PAOK defender was delivering at training, and the former reportedly booked a flight home to Greece after storming off the training pitch.  There was a heated exchange between the pair.[30] The Greece midfielder was so enraged after a training ground spat that he booked a himself on a flight back to Athens before being persuaded not to walk out on Fernando Santos's squad.[31]\n\nManiatis scored his debut international goal for Greece on 7 June 2016, with a spectacular 60-metre strike against Australia in an eventual 2\u20131 win.[32]\n\nOlympiacos\n\nStandard Li\u00e8ge\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Maniatis"}, {"id": 205, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3369/67379021/original/jan-szcz_sny-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Jan Szcz\u0119sny", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/jan-szcz_sny/67379021", "desc": "Jan Szcz\u0119sny is a Polish footballer who plays for Gwardia Warszawa."}, {"id": 206, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/90/1795946/original/phil-o-donnell-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Phil O'Donnell", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/phil-o_donnell/1795946", "desc": "Phillip O'Donnell (March 25, 1972 \u2013 December 29, 2007) was a Scottish footballer, who played as a  left-sided midfielder for Motherwell, Celtic, and Sheffield Wednesday during his career.

In 1999 O'Donnell was among a number of players who failed to agree terms on a new contract with Celtic chairman Fergus McCann and instead moved on.[citation needed]\n\nAfter leaving Celtic as a free agent,[8] O'Donnell signed for Sheffield Wednesday later that year. He made his debut against Everton on 11 September 1999, but injuries continued to curtail his career and he played just one match during his first season (when the club were relegated from the Premier League). He went on to play just 20 times in four years for Sheffield Wednesday (scoring once in a League Cup quarter final tie against Watford)[9] and was given a free transfer at the time of their relegation to Division Two in 2003.[citation needed]\n\nO'Donnell returned to Scotland, where Motherwell offered him the chance to train with them again. The Fir Park outfit re-signed him in January 2004, allowing him the chance to appear alongside his nephew, David Clarkson and earning him the club nickname, \"Uncle Phil\".[4] He was also the uncle of St Mirren midfielder Stephen O'Donnell and Brian Dempsie, who had also played for Motherwell. In his second spell at Motherwell, he appeared in another cup final, this time being on the losing side as Rangers defeated them 5\u20131 in the 2005 Scottish League Cup. The following season, he replaced Scott Leitch as club captain.[citation needed]\n\nOn 29 December 2007, O'Donnell collapsed during a game against Dundee United just as he was about to be substituted. He was treated on the pitch for about five minutes by the Motherwell and Dundee United club doctors before being taken by ambulance to Wishaw General Hospital. However, he was pronounced dead at 17:18 hours.[10] He was 35 years of age.[4]\n\nA postmortem examination was carried out on 1 January 2008 and it was revealed O'Donnell died of left ventricular failure.[11] His funeral was on 4 January, at St Mary's Church in Hamilton.[12] He was then buried in the town's Bent Cemetery.[13]\n\nHe was survived by his wife Eileen, their daughters Megan and Olivia and sons Christopher and Luc, aged twelve, six, ten and four years respectively.[14]\n\nFormer Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell, MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw, was among those to pay tribute. He hailed the midfielder as a \"great professional.\"[citation needed]\n\nMotherwell and other fans laid flowers, scarves, strips and other mementos at the gates of Fir Park.[5] The club's scheduled SPL game against Hibernian at Easter Road the following Wednesday was postponed, along with the club's home game with Celtic the following Sunday out of respect. Scottish Premier League chairman Lex Gold said: \"We understand from Phil's family that they would appreciate it if the Motherwell v Celtic game scheduled for 6 January 2008 could be postponed. Both clubs are happy to meet the request and we have called the game off.\"[15] On 31 December the SPL postponed the Celtic v Rangers fixture scheduled for 2 January 2008, following a request by O'Donnell's former club Celtic, which was agreed by Rangers.[16] These postponements contributed to fixture congestion at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, which required the 2007\u201308 Scottish Premier League season to be extended when Rangers reached the 2008 UEFA Cup Final.[17]\n\nPlayers on 30 December in Premier League matches between Derby County and Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City and Liverpool, wore black bands in his honour. Sheffield Wednesday's matches at Hull City and at home to Preston North End were preceded by a minute's applause as a mark of respect to their former player, with the Hillsborough flags flying at half mast.[18] All Premier League matches in the New Year programme were preceded with either a minute of applause or silence in O'Donnell's memory. While playing for Everton, James McFadden, a former Motherwell player, dedicated his goal to O'Donnell in Everton's 2\u20130 win at Middlesbrough by pointing solemnly to his black armband and then towards the sky.[19]\n\nNottingham Forest opted not to show their respects before their Football League One match with Huddersfield Town on New Year's Day. Forest manager Colin Calderwood, himself a Scottish former international with 36 caps, explained: \"The fact that it was a boy in Scotland, does that make it any different to a boy in Colombia?\" Calderwood later apologised for any offence caused by the comments, after he had been appointed manager of Hibernian in the SPL in November 2010.[20]\n\nThousands of tributes from around the world were posted on the Internet.[21] The club received hundreds of written tributes from fans as far as Korea and Ukraine, as well as many emotional messages from Sevilla FC, comparing O'Donnell's death to the similar fate of their player Antonio Puerta that August. Sevilla director of football Monchi said, \"This is terrible news. Right now, my thoughts are with Phil's family and everybody at Motherwell. Unfortunately, with the death of Phil O'Donnell, Motherwell have suffered a similar tragedy to ours. Antonio Puerta died at the beginning of the season and I know how terrible the whole experience is. Sevilla will be available to help in any way that we are able, to heal the pain and sadness of this tragic loss.\"[22][23]\n\nMotherwell announced the Main Stand at Fir Park would be renamed the \"Phil O'Donnell Stand\" as a permanent tribute[24] and his team-mates paid their own personal tribute by having his signature embroidered on their strips for the remainder of the 2007\u201308 season.[25] In November 2011, a permanent memorial to O'Donnell was erected on the side of the stand bearing his name.[26]\n\nOn 25 May 2008, a benefit match was held at Celtic Park in memory of O'Donnell with the proceeds going to various charities. The match was between a Celtic side drawn from their 1998 title-winning squad and a Motherwell side drawn from their 1991 Scottish Cup win. Other players such as David Clarkson and James McFadden played in the game. Henrik Larsson described the match as \"a sad occasion but at the same time it's a kind of celebration for everything.\" The match finished 5\u20131, in front of 60,000.[27]\n\nThere is also the annual sponsored walk, started on 29 December 2008, to honour O'Donnell's memory. The walk starts from Fir Park and ends at Celtic Park, the homes of two of O'Donnell's former clubs. The money raised from the walk goes directly to charities such as the British Heart Foundation and Mary's Meals.[28]\n\nIn December 2010, a number of fellow Scottish footballers that had played alongside Phil had thought of his family announced they would trek up Cotopaxi in Ecuador in memory of Phil to raise \u00a3100,000 for the British Heart Foundation. The trek is scheduled to take place in the summer of 2012.[29]\n\nSince O'Donnell's death in 2007, his nephew David Clarkson is the only player to have worn the number 10 shirt, which he had up until his departure in 2009. Since then this number, although not retired, has not been issued to any subsequent player.[citation needed]\n\nMotherwell\n\nCeltic\n\nIndividual\n\n\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_O%27Donnell_(footballer)"}, {"id": 207, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/477/9524548/original/roman-shirokov-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Roman Shirokov", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/roman-shirokov/9524548", "desc": "Roman Nikolayevich Shirokov (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0428\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0432 [r\u0250\u02c8man n\u02b2\u026ak\u0250\u02c8\u026ba\u026av\u02b2\u026at\u0255 \u0282\u0268\u02c8rok\u0259f]; born 6 July 1981) is a Russian international football official and a former player.\nAs a player, he was described as \"a deep-lying midfielder with an aptitude for getting forward to score goals\".", "full_desc": "\n\nRoman Nikolayevich Shirokov (Russian: \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0428\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0301\u043a\u043e\u0432 [r\u0250\u02c8man n\u02b2\u026ak\u0250\u02c8\u026ba\u026av\u02b2\u026at\u0255 \u0282\u0268\u02c8rok\u0259f]; born 6 July 1981) is a Russian international football official and a former player.\n\nAs a player, he was described as \"a deep-lying midfielder with an aptitude for getting forward to score goals\".[1]\n\nBefore signing for Zenit, Shirokov played for FC Khimki, Rubin Kazan, Saturn Moscow Oblast, FC Vidnoye, FC Istra, Torpedo-ZIL Moscow and CSKA Moscow's farm club.[citation needed]\n\nShirokov started his first season for Zenit as central back, as then-head coach Dick Advocaat was forced to fill the gaps left in the centre of defence after the departure of Martin \u0160krtel to Liverpool and severe injury to Nicolas Lombaerts.[citation needed]\n\nOn 18 July 2014 it was announced that Shirokov signed a contract with Spartak Moscow as a free agent.[2] After a long recovery from an injury he made his debut for Spartak on 26 October 2014 in a game against FC Lokomotiv Moscow, scoring a late equalizer in a 1\u20131 game. On 13 January 2015, he was loaned back to FC Krasnodar.[3]\n\nShirokov was benched during the 2015\u201316 season, in order to not pay him the amount due to him by contract if he plays a certain number of minutes.[4] The President of the RFU, Vitaly Mutko, commented: \"He's one of the best footballers in our country. I don't understand why he's not playing. If it's due to the contract clause that's just dishonest.\"[5] On 23 January 2016, his Spartak contract was dissolved by mutual consent.[6]\n\nOn 9 February 2016, he returned to his first club, PFC CSKA Moscow, signing a contract until the end of the 2015\u201316 season with an extension option.[7] His contract was not extended at the end of the season.[8]\n\nHe was called up for the Euro 2008 and started in the opening group match against Spain, being deployed in the centre of defence as then-manager of Russia Guus Hiddink decided to follow the footsteps of his compatriot Advocaat, thus relegating experienced Sergey Ignashevich to the bench. This move proved unsuccessful as Russia were beaten 1\u20134 with Shirokov at fault on the number of occasions, including Spaniards' first[9] and third[10] goals. After the game Hiddink slammed his team's performance in defence[11] and revamped the squad, leaving Shirokov out of the first team for the rest of the tournament.\n\nAfter a string of assuring performances in the centre of Zenit's midfield, he was called back to the national team in 2010 for a friendly against Bulgaria. \nHe was confirmed for the finalized UEFA Euro 2012 squad on 25 May 2012.[12] He scored the second goal of Russia's opening game of this tournament against the Czech Republic in a 4\u20131 win.[13]\n\nOn 2 June 2014, he was included in Russia's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad.[14] He was excluded from the squad on 6 June due to injury.[15]\n\nOn 5 June 2018, he was appointed by FC Dynamo Moscow as the deputy general director in charge of sports.[16] He left Dynamo on 1 May 2019.[17]\n\nDuring an amateur game in August 2020 he attacked a referee with punches to his face and kicks once he had knocked the referee to the ground, causing the referee to be hospitalized for three weeks.[18][19][20] He was reported to the police for assault.[21] He was tried and found guilty by a Moscow court.[20] He was sentenced to 100 hours of community service.[20] He was also suspended by his employer, Match TV.[20]\n\nOn 2 March 2022, Shirokov supported the Russian invasion of Ukraine, adding that those Russians, who are ashamed of the war, are welcome to leave the country.[22]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Shirokov"}, {"id": 208, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/567/11323524/original/diogo-luis-santo-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Diogo Lu\u00eds Santo", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/diogo-luis-santo/11323524", "desc": "Diogo Lu\u00eds Santo (born 26 May 1987), known simply as Diogo, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Malaysian club Johor Darul Ta'zim F.C. as a striker.\nAfter starting out at Portuguesa, he spent most of his professional career in the Superleague Greece with Olympiacos \u2013 having signed in 2008 \u2013 and in the Thai League 1 with Buriram United.", "full_desc": "\n\nDiogo Lu\u00eds Santo (born 26 May 1987), known simply as Diogo, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Malaysia Super League club Johor Darul Ta'zim.\n\nAfter starting out at Portuguesa, he spent most of his career in the Super League Greece with Olympiacos \u2013 having signed in 2008 \u2013 and in the Thai League 1 with Buriram United.\n\nBorn in S\u00e3o Paulo, Diogo started his football career at Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos. He quickly made a name for himself at the club, breaking into the first team in 2007 and contributing largely to a promotion to the S\u00e9rie A, scoring 18 goals in 28 games \u2013 season's best \u2013 and being voted the competition's best player.[3]\n\nIt was this form which initially prompted Brazilian under-20 coach N\u00e9lson Rodrigues to include Diogo in his team (he had already played in previous national youth sides). In 2008 he had his first taste of top-flight football with Portuguesa, and showed early good form with six goals in 13 matches.[4] Early in the same year, president Manuel da Lupa said he was as good as if not better than A.C. Milan's teenage sensation Alexandre Pato; he added that the player had only shown 50% of his capability due to consistent injuries.[5]\n\nIn July 2008, several teams had been attracted to Diogo's talents, and the player revealed his desire to play his trade in Europe after longtime admirers Arsenal were joined by ACF Fiorentina in bidding for his services. He had been monitored by the former's scouting department for more than two years, and offers included a \u00a39,000,000 one, promptly rejected by Portuguesa;[6] Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger also publicly stated that he had tried to sign him once, as a 16-year-old.[7]\n\nOlympiacos F.C. also became interested and, in a widely documented and somewhat controversial period of negotiation, Diogo finally signed for the Greek club in August 2008, for \u20ac9 million and 70% of the player's rights. After passing his medical, he agreed to a five-year contract.[8][9]\n\nDiogo made his first appearance in the season's opener, against Asteras Tripolis F.C. on 30 August 2008. On 6 September he scored from the penalty spot against Ionikos FC, in a friendly. In the second round, he netted the game's only goal at Skoda Xanthi FC. During his first campaign he also showcased his good heading ability by scoring many of his goals from headers, being at one point the player with more goals with that specific body part at four.\n\nIn that year's UEFA Cup, Diogo scored twice in the 5\u20130 home victory over FC Nordsj\u00e6lland on 2 October, adding two more in a 5\u20131 defeat of S.L. Benfica the following month, also in the group stage and at Karaiskakis Stadium.[10] Hence, heightened rumours of a big-money transfer to Europe's elite \u2013 and again to England \u2013 surfaced, whilst the player was ranked seventh (out of 50) in The Daily Telegraph's list of Footballers Transfer Target List;[11] eventually, the Piraeus team won the double.\n\nFurther interest arose in October 2008, now from three other Premier League sides, Middlesbrough, Chelsea and Liverpool.[12] The latter's coach, Rafa Ben\u00edtez, again declared interest in the player in March of the following year, preparing to offer \u00a312 million to acquire his services.[13] Anfield scouts had been said to have checked on him, seeing him as a perfect replacement for the departed Robbie Keane; Ben\u00edtez then loaned Sebasti\u00e1n Leto to Olympiacos, further fueling rumours that the player would be included in a swap deal, but nothing came to fruition, with Leto instead moving to Panathinaikos FC.[14]\n\nDiogo's second season was disastrous for both him and the team, suffering several injuries which limited to just slightly more than half of the games, scoring just two goals and losing his place in the starting lineup to Kostantinos Mitroglou. He started 2010\u201311 by netting twice against Besa Kavaj\u00eb of Albania in a 5\u20130 away win (11\u20131 on aggregate) in the Europa League. In the competition's next round, however, against Maccabi Tel Aviv FC, he was sent off after punching opposing goalkeeper Liran Strauber, in a 1\u20130 away loss that also meant the Greeks' elimination on the away goals rule.[15]\n\nDiogo returned to Brazil on 19 August 2010, being loaned to CR Flamengo.[16] Six months later, he joined Santos FC also on loan,[17] failing to perform overall and returning to Olympiakos in January 2012, being excluded from the squad later that year.[3]\n\nOn 6 March 2013, Diogo returned to his first club Portuguesa.[18]\n\nOn 31 December 2014, Diogo signed a two-year contract with Buriram United F.C. from the Thai Premier League.[19] He scored in his debut on 24 January 2015, helping his new team to defeat Bangkok Glass F.C. 1\u20130 in the Kor Royal Cup.[20]\n\nDiogo scored 45 goals in 51 competitive games in his first season,[21] as Buriram became the first Asian side to win five titles in one year.[22][23]\n\nOn 3 January 2019, Johor Darul Ta'zim F.C. announced the signing of Diogo for an approximate fee of \u20ac1.5 million, the highest ever paid by a Malaysian club.[24][25]\n\nOlympiacos\n\nSantos\n\nBuriram United\n\nJohor Darul Ta'zim\n\nBG Pathum United\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Lu%C3%ADs_Santo"}, {"id": 209, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/1633/32644353/original/lenny-rodrigues-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Lenny Rodrigues", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/lenny-rodrigues/32644353", "desc": "Lenny Rodrigues (born 10 May 1987) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Goa in the Indian Super League.", "full_desc": "\n\nLenny Rodrigues (born 10 May 1987) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Goa in the Indian Super League.\n\nBorn in Cortalim, Goa, began to develop a passion for football when his grandfather took him to watch local matches.[1] He began playing for Fransa-Pax before the club folded.

During this time, Dunn helped the club to win promotion out of the First Division in 2000\u201301, as well as lift the League Cup the following season. He also made his only appearance for England in 2002. He was sold to Premier League rivals Birmingham City for \u00a35.5 million a year later, before returning to Blackburn in 2007 for a fee of \u00a32.2 million; continuing as a crucial squad member.[3] He remained there until 2015, with them now a Championship club, when he signed for Oldham Athletic, his final club as a player before his retirement under a year later.\n\nHe was player-manager at Oldham between September 2015 and January 2016, and then Blackburn's under-23s and first-team assistant coach.

I was bored in the classroom. It never really excited me and it was never something I really wanted to do. I went to a good school \u2013 St Augustine's in Billington. \"I didn't wag school or anything like that.\"[6]\n\nGrowing up, Dunn wanted to be a footballer because of his influence from grandfather, David, who was a footballer himself, and was a Blackburn Rovers fan, along with his family.[7] Growing up, he idolised Simon Garner.[8] In addition to playing football, Dunn also played cricket.[9]\n\nDunn joined Blackburn Rovers as a trainee at the beginning of 1997 and quickly impressed the reserve side.[10] His first goal for Blackburn Rovers\u2019 Reserves came on 3 February 1997.[11] Dunn then played in both legs of the FA Youth Cup semi\u2013finals, as Blackburn Rovers Academy lost 4\u20133 on aggregate.[12] Nevertheless, he was part of the squad that saw Blackburn Rovers Youth win 3\u20130 against Everton Youth in a penalty shoot-out following a 1\u20131 draw after extra-time.[13] However, in the final of the Lancashire FA Youth Cup, they lost 3\u20131 against Manchester United Youth.[14] The following season, Dunn played in both legs of the FA Youth Cup, as they lost 5\u20133 on aggregate against Everton Youth.[15]\n\nThe start of the 1998\u201399 season saw Dunn being called up to the first-team squad by manager Roy Hodgson.[16] He made his debut during a goalless draw with Everton on 26 September 1998.

The gaffer explained to me why he did it afterwards and I agree with him.\"[18] In his second appearance, Blackburn beat Newcastle United at St James' Park in the League Cup; Dunn scored the winning penalty in the shootout.[19] The end of the year saw Dunn being linked a move away from Blackburn Rovers, as Preston North End wanted to sign him on loan.[20] But it was announced on 12 December that he signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2003.[21] His first goal came in a 3\u20131 victory against Aston Villa on 6 February.[22] Throughout the 1998\u201399 season, he had receive a handful of first-team appearances for the club.[23] At the end of the 1998\u201399 season, Dunn made sixteen appearances and scored one goal in all competitions.[24]\n\nAhead of the 1999\u20132000 season, it was expected[by whom?] that Dunn was to fight for his first-team place in the central midfield position.[25] He began the season when he appeared in a number of matches, either starting a match and coming on as a substitute, without able to play the whole game for the side.[26] On 22 September, Dunn scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20131 win against Portsmouth in the second round of the League Cup.[27] Dunn then spend the next two months playing for the reserve side, though he did return to the first-team once, coming against Leeds United in the third round of the League Cup.[28] On 6 November, Dunn returned to the first-team, where he started a match and played 83 minutes before being substituted, in a 2\u20132 draw against Ipswich Town.[29] Dunn started in the next two matches before he returned to the reserve side for a month until on 28 December 1999 against Portsmouth, starting the whole game, winning 2\u20131.[30] Dunn then regained his first-team place for the rest of the 1999\u20132000 season.[31] His lack of first-eam opportunities led him to a transfer request, only to be rejected by Blackburn Rovers.[32] He later withdrew the transfer request a month later.[33] Dunn then scored two goals in two matches between 18 March and 22 March against Fulham and Birmingham City.[34] Despite suffering injuries during the 1999\u20132000 season, Dunn made twenty\u2013six appearances and scored three times in all competitions.[35]\n\nAt the start of the 2000\u201301 season, Dunn became a first-team regular, establishing himself in the starting eleven, playing in the midfield position.[36] On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20132 win against Norwich City.[37] This was followed up when Blackburn entertained Rochdale in the League Cup, where Dunn scored a hat-trick from the penalty spot.[38] He then scored in the next two matches, against Nottingham Forest and Watford.[39] Two weeks later on 26 September, Dunn scored his seventh goal of the season, in a 1\u20131 draw against Portsmouth.[40] He reached double figures in terms of goals in 2000 after scoring five more goals, including a brace against Crystal Palace on 22 December.[41] Along the way, Dunn was suspended on three occasions.[42] After his performances attracted interests from top division clubs, Blackburn Rovers began open talks with him over a new contract.[43] It was announced on 14 February that he signed a four-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until 2005.[44] During the same month, Dunn added three more goals in February, including scoring against Bolton Wanderers in two separate matches.[45] His performances throughout February earned him the Young Player of the Month award.[46] He then scored three goals throughout April and then helped Blackburn achieve promotion back to the Premier League for the first time since 1999.[47] At the end of the 2000\u201301 season, Dunn made fifty\u2013two appearances and scored eighteen times in all competitions.

16 August 2003.[85] After the match, Manager Steve Bruce praised his performance, saying: \"David Dunn proved he had some real, real quality with the spotlight on him and such a big crowd. He's rushed to get the ball (for the penalty). He's got something about him and he's a special player.\"[86] Two weeks later on 30 August, Dunn scored his second goal of the season, in a 1\u20130 win against Newcastle United.[87] During a 0\u20130 draw against local rivals, Aston Villa on 19 October, he attempted to do the Rabona pass, only for it to backfire.[88] Dunn later spoke about his embarrassing incident on numerous occasions.[89][90][91][9] Since the start of the 2003\u201304 season, he started in every match until a niggling hamstring sustained in February meant that Dunn spent much of the second half of his first season on the side-line.[92] At the end of the 2003\u201304 season, Dunn made twenty\u2013two appearances and scored two times in all competitions.[93]\n\nThe beginning of his second season saw Dunn continuing to recover from his injury.[94] It was not until on 18 September 2004 when he returned to the first-team, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute, in a 1\u20131 draw against Charlton Athletic.[95] Dunn quickly re-established himself in the heart of the Birmingham midfield and chipped in some vital goals despite suffering from injury along the way.[96][97] However, a recurrence of Dunn's hamstring problems in November limited him to just a handful of performances for the remainder of the season, and kept him out of the side until midway through the following season.[98] At one point, he thought about retiring from football because of the injury.[99] At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, Dunn made twenty\u2013eight appearances and scored two times in all competitions.[100]\n\nThe 2005\u201306 season saw Dunn continuing rehabilitating from his hamstring injury.[101] It was not until on 16 October when he returned to the first-team, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss against rivals Aston Villa.[102] However, Dunn's return was short\u2013lived when he suffered a calf injury while training and was sidelined for a month.[103] Ultimately, Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League, with Dunn still not returning to fitness.[104] Amidst injuries, he went on to score three goals during the season, coming against Portsmouth, Reading and Wigan Athletic.[105] At the end of the 2005\u201306 season, Dunn made nineteen appearances and scoring three times in all competitions.[106]\n\nAhead of the 2006\u201307 season, Dunn made a return to training and spent the whole pre\u2013season regaining his fitness.[107] He made his first appearance of the season, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20131 win against Colchester United in the opening game of the season.[108] Since the start of the 2006\u201307 season, Dunn quickly became a first-team regular, playing in the midfield position.[109] He then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2\u20132 draw against Ipswich Town on 16 September 2006.[110] However, Dunn was plagued with injuries throughout the first half of the season.[111] Amid to injuries, he was linked with a return to Blackburn in the upcoming transfer window in November, as Bruce said his departure from Birmingham City could be imminent.[112] By the time he left the club, Dunn made eleven appearances and scored once in all competitions.[113]\n\nOn 17 January 2007, Dunn returned to Blackburn Rovers for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal believed to be \u00a32.2 million.[114] He rejected a move to Bolton Wanderers in favour of returning to his boyhood club.[115] On 3 February, Dunn played his first Premier League match since his return to Blackburn Rovers against Sheffield United and earned a free kick which led to Rovers scoring a last minute winner.[116] After the match, he said: \"It was good to be back out there again \u2013 it felt like I'd never been away. I was really touched by the reception I got from the fans \u2013 it was special for me.\"[117] Dunn then played a role in the FA Cup fifth round replay against Arsenal when he set up a goal for Benni McCarthy to score the only goal of the game to advance to the next round.[118] At the end of this campaign, despite injury problems, he managed to feature in a total of 16 games in all competitions,

Manager Darren Kelly stated that his addition would make the team's midfield one of the strongest in the league for the upcoming 2015\u201316 season.[214] Upon joining the club, he was given a number seventeen shirt.[215] Dunn made his Oldham Athletic debut, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20131 draw against Walsall in the opening game of the season.[216] Since making his debut for the club, he was involved in every match, and contributed two assists.[217] By the time Dunn was appointed manager, he made nine appearances in all competitions.[218]\n\nDunn represented England at international level and was first called up to the England U18 squad for the first time and made his debut for the U18 squad on 12 February 1998.[219] He was then a part of their squad for the 1998 UEFA European Championship in Cyprus, where they were eliminated in the Group Stage.[220]\n\nIn November 1998, Dunn was called up to the Under-21 squad for the first time.[221] He made his debut on 18 November 1998.[222] In May 2000, Dunn was called up to the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Slovakia.[223] He played two times in the tournament, as England were eliminated in the Group Stage.[224] It was not until on 31 August 2000 that Dunn scored his first goal for England U21, in a 6\u20131 win against Georgia U21.[225] Two months later, he was appointed as captain for a 1\u20131 draw against Germany.[226] Dunn was called up for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship and played three times, as they finished last in their group.[227]\n\nThroughout 2001, there were calls from the British media that Dunn should be called up to the England squad.[228] He was considered to be in the England squad for the FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final cut.[229] Three months later, on 3 September 2002, Dunn was called up to the England for the first time and made his first cap on 7 September 2002, when he replaced Steven Gerrard against Portugal at half-time.[230] This turned out to be his only senior England appearance.[231] Following this, there were calls for England to call Dunn to the squad, but to no avail, as he said: \"I know that I should\u2019ve had more caps. I truly wish that I'd knuckled down at times and pushed myself that bit more. I'm really proud that I played professionally for my country, it's what I started out wanting to do but there's always that little bugbear that I could and maybe should\u2019ve had more caps.\"[90][232]\n\nOn 13 September 2015, following the sacking of Darren Kelly, Dunn was appointed as the caretaker manager of his playing club Oldham Athletic, with him supposed to remain in that position until a permanent replacement was found.[233] At the time of his appointment, he was working on completing his UEFA Pro Licence, having previously completed his UEFA A and B Licences.[91][234] On 7 October, Dunn was appointed on a permanent basis, following a recent unbeaten run.[235] His first game in charge as their permanent manager came three days later in a 4\u20132 defeat to Scunthorpe United at Boundary Park.[236] His first victory was a 2\u20131 victory at Swindon Town on 20 October 2015.[237]\n\nHis tenure as manager did not go according to plan: Oldham entered into a relegation battle after a negative run of results which resulted in Dunn being dismissed on 12 January 2016, just three months after his appointment.[238] Oldham had gone several league games without a win.[239] Dunn's departure also led to the exits of Dean Holden and Keith Brown, who were both members of Dunn's coaching staff.[238] He left the club sat in twenty-second place, with Dunn being replaced by heavily experienced John Sheridan a day later.[240]\n\nOn 25 February 2016, Dunn returned to his former playing club Blackburn Rovers to work alongside his former teammate Damien Johnson in the academy set-up as the under-23s assistant coach.[241] His appointment as coach saw Dunn hang up his boots after an 18-year-spell as a professional footballer.[241] On 22 February 2017, Dunn was promoted to first-team coach under new manager Tony Mowbray.[242] Dunn remained in that role until the end of the season; he reverted to his previous position after Blackburn were relegated to League One.[243] A successful season followed for Blackburn: the under-23s (which Dunn coached with Johnson) won the Premier League 2 Division 2, earning promotion to Division 1; whereas the first-team achieved immediate promotion back to the Championship as runners-up.[244] Dunn departed Blackburn for the third time in June 2018, in order to concentrate on his family and other business interests outside of football.[244][245]\n\nIn January 2020, Dunn joined League One side Blackpool as an assistant coach.[246] On 12 February, Dunn was installed as the club's caretaker manager until further notice, following the dismissal of Simon Grayson, who was sacked after a negative run of form.[247] His first game in charge was 2\u20131 defeat in the league, away at Bristol Rovers, taking place three days following his appointment.[248] However, Blackpool went on to record a respectable run of form, including a goalless draw against AFC Wimbledon,[249] before achieving 2\u20131 victories whilst hosting Bolton Wanderers and promotion-chasing Ipswich Town at Bloomfield Road, respectively.[250][251]\n\nNeil Critchley, a highly acclaimed coach who had previously been employed by Premier League giants Liverpool as their under-23s team manager, was appointed as Grayson's replacement on 2 March.[252] Following his appointment, Critchley stated that he was satisfied with the existing coaching staff, with Dunn confirming two days later that he intended to remain in his previous role as an assistant coach, with all four members of the coaching staff being on the touchline for the club's reserves fixture against Huddersfield Town one day previously.[253]\n\nIn July 2020, Dunn became linked with the vacant managerial position at Barrow, whose previous manager Ian Evatt had recently departed to join Bolton Wanderers just shortly after guiding the club to promotion into the English Football League.[254] On 9 July, his appointment at the club was confirmed, after he signed a two-year contract.[255] This became Dunn's first permanent managerial position since his tenure at Oldham Athletic concluded in 2016.[256] After 22 matches, the last nine without a win, and with the team 21st in the table, Dunn was sacked on 13 December 2020.[257]\n\nIn July 2022, he joined Port Vale as a first-team coach.[258]\n\nDunn was in a relationship with actress Sammy Winward; the couple were once engaged and had a daughter named Mia together.[259] Dunn has three children with his wife, Hayley.[260] The oldest, Isaac, was born in 2008.[133]\n\nDuring his first spell at Blackburn Rovers, Dunn wrote a column for the Lancashire Telegraph,[261] and was known as a prankster.[262]\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\nBirmingham City\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dunn"}, {"id": 211, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/519/10373370/original/arthur-henfrey-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Arthur Henfrey", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/arthur-henfrey/10373370", "desc": "Arthur George Henfrey (19 December 1867 \u2013 17 October 1929) was an English footballer who made five appearances for England between 1891 and 1896 playing initially as a forward and later as a half back.

He began his management career as joint-manager of Worcester City, alongside John Snape, in May 2017. In March 2018, he joined Halesowen Town as a player, where he remained until moving on to Mickleover Sports in August 2019. He later played for Grantham Town, Nuneaton Borough, Cradley Town and Stourport Swifts.\n\nHughes spent four years at West Bromwich Albion as a schoolboy from ages 11 to 15, though was not offered a youth team contract.[3] He then had unsuccessful trials at numerous clubs, though came close to being offered a contract by Swansea City.[4] He instead started his career playing semi-professionally for Conference club Kidderminster Harriers, whilst holding down a part-time job as a roofer.[3] Although Hughes scored 34 goals in the 1996\u201397 season, Kidderminster failed to gain promotion to the Football League after finishing five points behind champions Macclesfield Town.[5] At this point in his career Hughes was regarded as one of England's finest semi-professionals and was called up to the England national football C team.[6] In total, Hughes scored 70 goals in 139 games for Kidderminster in all competitions.[7] He also played for amateur touring side Middlesex Wanderers during their tour of Vietnam whilst he was aged 19.[8]\n\nHughes was sold to West Bromwich Albion for an initial \u00a3200,000\u00a0\u2013 incentives later took the final sum up to \u00a3380,000\u00a0\u2013 in August 1997.[9] He said \"It was a dream to join the team I have supported all my life\".[10] The Daily Mirror printed that \"Hughes has red hair, tattoos of a Tasmanian devil and a British bulldog on his forearms, dynamite in his boots and Albion in his blood.\"[3] Fans affectionately nicknamed him the \"Ginger Ninja\".[11]\n\nHe made his debut at The Hawthorns as a substitute in a 2\u20131 win over Tranmere Rovers on 9 August 1997.[3][12] Seven days later he scored two goals from the bench in a 3\u20132 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road.[3] Though signed by Ray Harford, he came to the fore under new boss Denis Smith.[13] Smith handed Hughes his first start on 28 December, in a 1\u20131 home draw with Stoke City. He finished his debut season as the club's top-scorer with 14 goals in 41 appearances, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.[13]\n\nHe started the 1998\u201399 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August.[14] Despite having recently signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours of a big money move to a host of Premier League clubs.[15][16] West Brom eventually issued a \"hands-off\" warning to other clubs.[17] He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games.[18][19] This tally left him as the country's top-scorer.[20] He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division.[21] He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have \"been a number of things going on behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently\".[22] In particular, his \u00a31,400 a week salary was compared with the \u00a35,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.[23]\n\nHe remained at the club for the 1999\u20132000 season and scored 17 goals in 43 appearances. Albion struggled in the First Division under new manager Brian Little, though improved after Gary Megson replaced Little as manager in March and avoided relegation despite Hughes missing the final five matches of the season due to a knee injury.[24]\n\nHe was partnered with Jason Roberts for the 2000\u201301 season; the pair went on to score 40 goals between them to help secure the \"Baggies\" a play-off place.[25] With 23 goals to his name, he again attracted interest from other clubs.[26] He claimed two hat-tricks in seven days against Gillingham and Preston North End. Hughes converted a penalty in a 2\u20132 draw with Bolton Wanderers in the first leg of the play-off semi-final, before a 3\u20130 defeat at the Reebok Stadium ended Albion's play-off hopes.[27][28] He refused to sign a new contract in July 2001, and was placed on the transfer list.[29]\n\nHughes was sold to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record transfer fee of \u00a35,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding \u00a35 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001.[30][31] His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be \u00a315,000 a week.[32] Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001\u201302 season as the club's top-scorer.[33] Coventry rejected a loan offer from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.[34]\n\nIn August 2002, Hughes returned to West Bromwich Albion for a club record \u00a32.5\u00a0million\u00a0\u2013 half the fee Albion had received for him a year earlier\u00a0\u2013 and signed a four-year deal with the club.[35][36] Despite being a regular in the first team, Hughes failed to score a single Premier League goal in the 2002\u201303 season and Albion were relegated in 19th place with just six wins and 26 points from 38 matches.[37] Hughes was criticised by several teammates following the club's 1\u20130 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park, though was publicly backed by manager Gary Megson.[38] He told the press that \"I want to establish myself in the Premiership and any accusations of me not pulling my weight should be made to my face.\"[39] He put his poor form down to him missing pre-season training with injury problems.[40] He rediscovered his form back in the First Division, scoring 12 goals in 36 games in 2003\u201304 as West Brom secured promotion with a second-place finish.[41] His contract at West Bromwich Albion was immediately terminated in August 2004, following his conviction for causing death by dangerous driving. He spent the next three years in prison, serving half of his six-year sentence.[42]\n\nUpon his release from prison on 20 August 2007, Hughes signed a two-year contract with League One club Oldham Athletic;[43][44] the club asked supporters \"not to pass moral judgement\".[45] His reported salary of \u00a31,800-a-week at Boundary Park was less than a 10th of what he earned at the peak of his career with West Bromwich Albion.[46] Hughes made his debut for Oldham in a 4\u20131 defeat by Hartlepool United at Victoria Park on 1 September 2007.[47] He failed to find the net in his first seven games, and underwent an operation to correct a hernia problem.[48] He recovered quickly from the procedure, and registered his first two goals for the Latics in a 3\u20130 win over AFC Bournemouth at Dean Court on 25 November,[49] before being named in the \"League One Team of the Week\".[50] He scored his first hat-trick for the club against Millwall in a 3\u20132 victory at The Den on 15 December, and again made the \"League One Team of the Week\".[51] He picked up a groin injury in March 2008, and was sidelined for the rest of the season.[52] Hughes had scored eight goals by the end of the 2007\u201308 season, making him the club's second highest goalscorer behind Craig Davies.[53]\n\nHe opened his account for the 2008\u201309 season with a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win over Cheltenham Town on 23 August.[54] Stating his future ambitions as playing Championship football with Oldham, he was offered a new deal at the club on 30 December 2008.[55][56] He was linked with a move to Doncaster Rovers in January 2009, but stayed put after talks with manager John Sheridan, who insisted Hughes was \"very happy\" at Oldham.[57][58] In March 2009, it was widely reported that Hughes had been involved in a drunken brawl with Sheridan where Hughes was reported to have had him \"in a headlock\". Sheridan later downplayed the incident as \"jovial\", saying \"people have made things up\".[59] Sheridan was sacked, but insisted that the two incidents were not related, as \"it was results that cost me the job\".[60]\n\nOn 26 March 2009, Hughes joined Championship club Blackpool on loan until the end of the season.[61] He made his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Plymouth Argyle at Bloomfield Road on 4 April.[62] His first goal for the club came on 18 April against Charlton Athletic at the Valley, when after coming on as an 89th-minute substitute, and with Blackpool 2\u20131 down, he scored four minutes later to make the score 2\u20132.[63] Hughes ended the campaign as Oldham's highest scorer with 18 goals in 40 appearances.[64] However, he was one of a number of players released by the club's new manager Dave Penney in May 2009,[65] and returned to Kidderminster Harriers for training in order to keep up his fitness levels whilst searching for a new club.[66]\n\nHughes signed for League Two team Notts County on a two-year contract on 22 July 2009, on the same day that Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson arrived at the club as director of football.[67] He scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 5\u20130 victory over Bradford City on the opening day of the season.[68] He then got his second hat-trick against Northampton Town in a 5\u20132 home win on 12 September. He claimed his third hat-trick of the campaign on 28 December during a 4\u20131 win over Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium.[69] However the club endured a turbulent time, with manager Ian McParland sacked and replaced by Hans Backe, who himself resigned after Qadbak Investments proved unable to fund Backe's wages.[70][71] New owner Ray Trew appointed Steve Cotterill as manager, and County entered April ten points behind league leaders Rochdale, though Hughes remained confident that they could reduce the deficit and win the league.[72][73] On 17 April, Hughes scored two goals in a 4\u20131 victory over Morecambe as County won promotion to League One.[74] He was named as League Two's Player of the Month in April.[75] On 1 May, Hughes added another two goals in County's final home game of the season, making him the first Notts player to score 30 league goals since Tommy Lawton in the 1949\u201350 season.[76][77] He finished as the division's top-scorer in 2009\u201310 with 30 league goals in 39 games, and was named on the PFA Team of the Year alongside teammates Kasper Schmeichel and Ben Davies.[78] County won the league by a ten-point margin.[79] In July 2010, Hughes signed a one-year extension to his contract that would see him at Meadow Lane until the summer of 2012.[80]\n\nOn 23 September 2010, Hughes revealed a 'Boing, Boing' t-shirt in a League Cup tie with Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux\u00a0\u2013 the slogan of Wolves' rivals West Bromwich Albion\u00a0\u2013 and was quizzed by police after angry Wolves fans retaliated to the message by attacking Notts County supporters' coaches. He was reported to be \"angry\" at being named as a substitute in a league game against Milton Keynes Dons on 11 December, though boss Paul Ince stated that \"Hughesy is 34 and cannot play week in week out. But he's never come and said 'I should be starting'. He's been different class.\"[81] On 8 January 2011, he was on the scoresheet as County beat Premier League side Sunderland 2\u20131 in the FA Cup.[82] Two weeks later he was confirmed to be a target of Sheffield Wednesday.[83] He remained with the \"Magpies\", and ended the 2010\u201311 season as the club's top-scorer with 16 goals in 37 appearances.[84] The club again went through a succession of managers\u00a0\u2013 Craig Short, Paul Ince and then Martin Allen\u00a0\u2013 and ended the season three points above the relegation zone.[85][86][87]\n\nOn 8 September 2011, he played against Italian club Juventus in the inaugural game of the Juventus Stadium, and scored County's goal in a 1\u20131 draw; after the game he had a signed shirt from Andrea Pirlo.[8][88] The next month he accepted a pay cut to sign a new 18-month contract, and was quoted as saying he never planned to leave the club as \"the fans have taken me in and I love it here\".[89][90] He ended the 2011\u201312 campaign on 11 goals in 44 games.[91] In summer 2012, the club rejected offers for Hughes from Cheltenham Town and former club Oldham Athletic.[92]\n\nAt the beginning of the 2012\u201313 season, new manager Keith Curle stated that \"we know he is of an age where he won't be playing for 46 games, so he needs to be managed\".[93] New signing Yoann Arquin became the county's first choice striker, and Hughes announced his intention to leave the club in order to find first team football.[94] He was reported to have joined Port Vale on loan, with a view to a permanent move, on 22 November 2012; though the deal had yet to be ratified by the English Football League.[95] However, the next day it was revealed that the loan move would not go through as the relevant paperwork had not been sent in on time.[96] Three weeks later Hughes provided the club with a sick note, saying that he was unavailable until January.[97] His contract was terminated by mutual consent on 7 January 2013.[98]\n\nHughes joined Port Vale the day after securing his exit from Notts County, as the BBC reported that \"promotion-chasing boss Micky Adams wants to bring him in to add impetus to a Vale attack who have occasionally misfired this term\".[99] He signed a contract to keep him at Vale Park until the end of the 2012\u201313 season, at which point his contract would be extended by 12 months if the \"Valiants\" were promoted.[100] However Hughes later revealed that Adams was against the transfer but had been overruled by chairman Norman Smurthwaite.[8] He marked his debut against the \"Gills\" with the winning goal that sent Vale to the top of the table.[101] Being partnered with the country's leading goalscorer Tom Pope allowed Hughes space in front of goal vacated by opposition defenders attempting to double up on Pope.[102] Hughes scored his first hat-trick for the \"Valiants\" in a 7\u20131 home victory over Burton Albion on 5 April, with two of his goals coming from the penalty spot as he took over from Jennison Myrie-Williams as the club's penalty taker.[103] This performance won him a place on the League Two team of the week.[104] Vale were promoted at the end of the season, with Hughes scoring ten goals in his 18 games, ensuring his contract was extended until summer 2014.[105]\n\nHe was not a regular starter in the 2013\u201314 season, especially as Jordan Hugill began to impress from the youth development squad, and so he decided to leave the club in the January transfer window.[106]\n\nOn 3 January 2014, he joined Conference Premier side Forest Green Rovers on an 18-month contract.[107] Manager Adrian Pennock stated that \"He's come to play football, he's not come for money and I'm chuffed to have him on board. He has the experience we need and I believe he'll score goals.\"[108] He made his debut six days later in a 1\u20131 draw with Hereford United at The New Lawn.[109] On 25 January, he scored his first goals for the club, securing a brace in a 3\u20130 home win over Chester.[110] He ended the 2013\u201314 season with eight goals in 21 appearances for Rovers.\n\nOn the opening day of the 2014\u201315 season, Hughes scored Forest Green's winning goal in a 1\u20130 away victory at Southport.[111] He then scored his 300th career goal with his second strike of the season in a 2\u20130 win over Alfreton Town at The New Lawn on 16 August 2014.[112]\n\nOn 30 January 2015, Hughes returned to Conference Premier club Kidderminster Harriers on a deal till the end of the season after having his contract with Forest Green Rovers mutually terminated. On his 'second debut' for Kidderminster, he put his side ahead in a Worcestershire Senior Cup tie against Stourbridge.[113] He also scored on his league return against Woking at Aggborough, scoring in the 39th minute in a 1\u20131 draw.[114] He was released at the end of the season as manager Gary Whild's playing budget was reduced by half for the 2015\u201316 campaign.[115]\n\nAfter impressing in pre season, Hughes signed for Northern Premier League Premier Division side Ilkeston, and was sent off on his debut against Skelmersdale United on 15 August 2015.[116]\n\nIn September 2015, Hughes signed for Worcester City on non-contract terms, who played at Aggborough, the home of Kidderminster Harriers where he started his career.[117] He scored 19 goals in 29 appearances in the 2015\u201316 campaign. In February 2017, he applied to succeed Carl Heeley as manager.[118] However, he instead left the financially troubled club and moved on to National League North rivals AFC Telford United.[119]\n\nIn March 2018, Hughes signed for Northern Premier League Premier Division side Halesowen Town as a player.[120] The \"Yeltz\" ended the 2017\u201318 season in 23rd-place, before being relegated out of the Southern League Premier Division Central at the end of the 2018\u201319 campaign. He left Halesowen in August 2019, after losing his place in the starting eleven.[121] Later that month he joined league rivals Mickleover Sports,[122] where he made nineteen league appearances and scored six goals,[123] and then Grantham Town in January 2020,[124] where he scored once in six league appearances.[125]\n\nHe was reported to have been a target for Nuneaton Borough just before the 2019\u201320 season was formally abandoned on 26 March, with all results from the season being expunged, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England.[126][127] Hughes also ended up signing with Nuneaton in March 2020, before he announced his retirement a month later, at the age of 43.[128] In October 2021, having made one scoring appearance for Cradley Town,[129] Hughes appeared on the team-list for Stourport Swifts.[130] He remained with the club until the end of the 2021\u201322 season, scoring four goals in 19 league appearances.[131]\n\nHughes rejoined Worcester City as both a player and as joint-manager, alongside John Snape, on 4 May 2017; Worcester had just been relegated out of the National League North.[132] He resigned on 6 March 2018.[133] In March 2019, he was appointed caretaker player-manager of Halesowen Town,[134] remaining in the role until May.[135]\n\nDescribing Hughes's attributes in January 2013, former Notts County coach Dave Kevan said that he was a \"fantastic finisher... a clever player whose movement is good, whose intelligence is good, who uses his body well and who uses his strength well... he plays with his brain and he's adapted his game as he has got older... he's also clever enough to create opportunities for others\".[136] He maintained a \"natural goalscoring instinct\" throughout his career, and has said \"I always fancy myself to stick the ball in the back of the net if I get a chance\".[137][138] His dancing goal celebration originated as a mocking tribute of a friend's bad dancing.[4]\n\nThe son of Bill and Gail Hughes, older brother to Clint and Brett, Hughes worked with his father as a roofer in his home-town of Smethwick before turning professional.[139] In 1999, Sharlene Gillies claimed that she and Hughes had a child together.[140] DNA tests later proved that he was not the father, though by this time his engagement to lap dancer Donna Nisbet was called off.[141] Hughes stated that \"I don't think Donna was particularly happy with all the limelight that comes with football\", though insisted that barracking from opposition fans only made him more determined to put in a good performance on the pitch.[142] Hughes and Jason Roberts were questioned by police over allegations that they assaulted a man outside a pub in Brierley Hill; the case was dropped in September 2000.[25] It was reported that he had converted to Islam during his time in prison, due in part to his friendship with Muslim prisoners and the fact that abuse of alcohol had helped to bring about his downfall\u00a0\u2013 his father said that \"this story is not true.\"[143] In 2005 Hughes was reported to be on suicide watch after learning that his wife had reportedly been seeing a younger man.[144]\n\nHe married air hostess Anna Kuzmanic in June 2000 in the Croatian town of Trogir.[145] The couple had two children together but split up in 2008; the split was described as \"very amicable\".[146] His eldest, Mia, was born in November 2000.[147] Hughes was declared bankrupt in March 2018.[148]\n\nOn 23 November 2003, near his home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG[149] and went onto the wrong side of the road before colliding with a Renault Sc\u00e9nic.[150] A passenger in the Renault, Douglas Graham, was killed in the incident, whilst his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were severely injured.[150] Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later.[150] He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.[151] He denied the charge,[152] though later pleaded guilty to charges of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.[153]\n\nDuring his trial at Coventry Crown Court, Hughes was accused of driving too fast in wet conditions and was described as driving \"like a madman\".[154] He claimed the brakes on his car had locked, though tests showed that the brakes were in perfect working order and had technology installed to prevent the driver from losing control.[155] When asked where he had been in the 36 hours after leaving the scene of the incident Hughes said that \"I would rather not say, really\", though later admitted he had travelled 20 miles to Smethwick.[156] Prosecutor Melbourne Inman QC told the court Hughes had fled the scene to dodge a breath test.[157] On 9 August 2004, Hughes was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, and was sentenced to six years imprisonment.[150] Frisby said that the sentence was not long enough.[158] Hughes lodged an appeal against the sentence, but not the conviction.[159] In January 2005, his appeal for his sentence to be reduced was refused.[160]\n\nHe served his time in Category C prisons.[161] During his time in HM Prison Featherstone he played in the Staffordshire County Senior League for the prison football team.[162] He also helped to organise a charity football match which raised \u00a35,000 for a children's hospice.[163] He was released in August 2007, three years into his six-year sentence.[164]\n\n\"After today I do not intend to discuss or make comment about the events which led to my imprisonment. I have made this decision, not out of protection for myself, but with regard to the privacy and respect for the families involved. I made dreadful mistakes and decisions that will live with me for the rest of my life. It also greatly affected my immediate family, including my wife and children, and I will never forgive myself for this.\"\nOn 3 December 2011, Hughes was arrested and bailed on charges of sexual assault after an incident in Croydon.[166][167] He was then charged with the offence on 30 January 2012.[168] In May 2012, Hughes was found guilty of common assault and fined \u00a3500, but the charge of sexual assault was dropped.[169]\n\nNotts County\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hughes"}, {"id": 220, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/84/1674197/original/niall-quinn-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Niall Quinn", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/niall-quinn/1674197", "desc": "Niall John Quinn, (honorary MBE born 6 October 1966) is an Irish former professional footballer and businessman, and the ex-chairman of Sunderland.

Quinn also received 92 caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team, scoring 21", "full_desc": "\n\nNiall John Quinn (honorary MBE;[3] born 6 October 1966) is an Irish former professional footballer, manager, businessman and sports television pundit.\n\nAs a player he was a striker who played top flight football for Arsenal, Manchester City and Sunderland, with spells in the Premier League for both City and the Black Cats. Quinn also received 92 caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team, scoring 21 times, which makes him Ireland's second highest goalscorer of all time. He also appeared with the Irish team at the UEFA European Football Championship of 1988 and two FIFA World Cups in 1990 and 2002.[4][5]\n\nHe later was part of a consortium to buy Sunderland and became the club's chairman. He also had a spell as manager before stepping down to a role of club director. He left the club in February 2012 and has since worked as a pundit namely on Sky Sports.\n\nNiall Quinn played Gaelic football for the Perrystown, Dublin 12, club Robert Emmets.[6] He also played underage football and hurling for Dublin. In July 1983, Quinn captained a Dublin Colleges GAA party on a one-month tour of Australia.[citation needed]\n\nAged 16, he played in the 1983 All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship Final,[7] and was offered a contract to play professional Australian rules football before settling on a career in football.[8] He played Gaelic football[9] for Co. Kildare club Eadestown after his retirement, winning a junior C county title in 2008.[10]\n\n\"I learned my trade at Arsenal, became a footballer at Manchester City, but Sunderland got under my skin. I love Sunderland.\"\nHe played as a youth for Irish club Manortown United and then Lourdes Celtic in Crumlin, Dublin 12. After an unsuccessful trial at Fulham he signed professional forms with English club Arsenal in 1983. He was signed as a centre-forward, but also had a brief spell as a centre-half for the Arsenal third team.[12] After scoring 18 goals in 18 reserve matches in the first half of the 1985\u201386 season, Quinn was included in the first-team squad for a match against Liverpool.[7] Quinn scored in the match as Arsenal recorded a 2\u20130 win.[13] He made a further 11 league appearances for Arsenal that season, but failed to score as they finished seventh in the league.[14] The end of the season brought Quinn his first call-up to the Republic of Ireland national team.[15]\n\nQuinn found himself playing under a new manager for the following season, as George Graham was appointed in place of Don Howe.[16] Quinn had a regular place in the side that season, appearing in 35 league games and scoring eight goals. He also collected a Football League Cup winner's medal as Arsenal triumphed 2\u20131 over Liverpool.[17] However, after Arsenal signed another target man, Alan Smith, in the 1987 close season,[18] Quinn struggled to get into the team. Over the next three seasons he managed a total of just 20 league appearances and five goals \u2013 his three appearances in 1988\u201389 not being enough for a title medal. Quinn's lack of opportunities led him to submit a written transfer request at the start of the 1989\u201390 season.[19] In total he scored 20 goals in 94 appearances for Arsenal, of which 81 were starts.[13]\n\nManchester City manager Howard Kendall signed Quinn for \u00a3800,000 in March 1990, shortly before the transfer deadline.[20] He marked his debut with a goal, in a 1\u20131 draw against Chelsea at Maine Road.[20] He scored 22 times in his first full season, and he went on to spend six years at the club, scoring 78 goals in 245 appearances; his time at City was hampered by a cruciate ligament injury in 1993\u201394. Although he returned to the side the following season, he managed just eight goals from 35 games.\n\nHis most notable game for City was 20 April 1991 when he scored early on and saved a penalty as City beat Derby County 2\u20131, relegating Derby in the process.[21] City goalkeeper Tony Coton had been sent off before half time for fouling Dean Saunders to concede the penalty. At this time teams rarely named goalkeepers as substitutes, so Quinn replaced Coton in goal. Other notable games included the Manchester derby on 7 November 1993, in which he scored twice in the first half to put City 2\u20130 up against United by half time, although a remarkable United comeback saw City lose 3\u20132.[22]\n\nIn the 1993 close season, Everton made a bid to sign Quinn and a further bid was made early in the 1993\u201394 season, but both bids were rejected and Quinn remained at Maine Road for a further three seasons.[23] A cruciate ligament injury sustained in a match against Sheffield Wednesday in November 1993 caused Quinn to miss the majority of the 1993\u201394 season, and prevented him from playing in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He returned at the start of the 1994\u201395 season, but the partnership forged by Uwe R\u00f6sler and Paul Walsh in his absence meant he was not always a starter. In attempt to reduce the wage bill, Manchester City tried to sell Quinn in the 1995 close-season, but a proposed move to Lisbon club Sporting fell through after failure to agree contractual terms.[24]\n\nHe managed a total of 193 league appearances in over six years at Maine Road, and scored a total of 64 goals for them.[25]\n\nQuinn finished his career with a highly successful spell at Sunderland, joining the north-east club in August 1996 for a club record \u00a31.3\u00a0million, although he missed six months of his first season due to a knee injury \u2013 similar to the one which ruined his World Cup chances three years earlier. Before his injury, he had got off to a fine start to his Sunderland career, finding the net twice on his debut in a 4\u20131 win at Nottingham Forest. In his absence from September to March, Sunderland struggled and although he was back in action by the end of the season, they were relegated.[26]\n\nHis partnership with striker Kevin Phillips, signed in the 1997 close season, was one of the most prolific in the Football League in the late 1990s/early 2000s (a combined 194 goals for both players in all competitions from 1997-98 to 2002-03) and helped the club to regain promotion to the Premiership for the 1999\u20132000 season. In March 1999 Quinn again had to play in goal, this time replacing the injured Thomas S\u00f8rensen in a game against Bradford City. In similar circumstances to when playing for Manchester City against Derby County in 1991 Quinn scored and then went in goal, and kept a clean sheet to help his side win.[27] He also has the distinction of being the first player to score at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, against Manchester City in 1997. He became a local legend at Sunderland, winning both the Sunderland and North East Sportswriters' Player of the Year awards in 1999 after scoring 21 goals in Sunderland's record-breaking Division One title-winning season. His final appearance for Sunderland came on 19 October 2002 against West Ham.[28]\n\nIn a league career lasting 17 years, he had played a total of 475 times in the Premier League and Football League, scoring 141 goals.\n\nQuinn played in the qualifiers for the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship, and made his Irish international debut at under-17 level against Northern Ireland at Seaview in a 6\u20131 friendly win in January 1985, the first ever fixture between the two nations. Quinn scored a hat trick as did Eamonn Dolan. However Arsenal refused permission for Quinn to travel to the 1985 FIFA World Youth Championships.[citation needed]\n\nQuinn made his senior debut as a substitute against the host nation in the Iceland Triangular Tournament in 1986. Quinn played for his country at two World Cups, in 1990 and 2002; he missed the 1994 FIFA World Cup because of injury.[29]\t\t\nQuinn was also a member of the Irish squad that participated in the 1988 European Championship playing just once, as a substitute in the Republic of Ireland's 1\u20130 win over England in Stuttgart.\n\nQuinn scored the equaliser against the Netherlands in the 1990 FIFA World Cup which allowed the Republic to progress to the second round of that tournament. In the qualifiers for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he scored against Cyprus on his 35th birthday to break the all-time goalscoring record, then held by Frank Stapleton. In the tournament proper, his header set up Robbie Keane's late equaliser against Germany, which was the only goal Germany conceded before the final. In the second-round, with the Republic behind 1\u20130 to Spain, it was a foul on Quinn that led to Ireland's last-minute penalty, converted by Robbie Keane, which tied the game and brought extra-time, but the Republic lost 3\u20132 in the resulting penalty shootout.\n\nAfter the tournament, he announced his retirement from international football, amassing 92 caps. At the time, he was his country's all-time top scorer with 21 goals; this record was later surpassed by Robbie Keane in October 2004.\n\nQuinn had a testimonial match between Sunderland and the Republic of Ireland in 2002. He donated the entire proceeds to charity, an act for which he received a number of awards, including an honorary MBE. Instead of receiving an appearance fee for the game, all the players received a letter from a sick child. Quinn played for both teams during the match, which raised over \u00a31 million. The Republic of Ireland won the match 3\u20130.[30]\n\nQuinn retired in 2003 at the age of 37, taking a brief coaching role at Sunderland. Quinn has also made appearances as a television pundit and commentator for televised matches involving his former teams with Sky Sports. He made a single league appearance for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana in March 2006 to promote the league and the side's link with Arsenal.[31]\n\nQuinn released an acclaimed autobiography Niall Quinn \u2013 The Autobiography (2002), which was ghostwritten by Tom Humphries. It won the Best Autobiography category in the inaugural British Sports Book Awards.[32] It was also nominated for a William Hill Sports Book of the Year award.[33] The book is not structured chronologically, but rather in the context of Quinn's career swansong, the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.\n\nHeading the Drumaville Consortium of wealthy Irish businessmen, in June 2006, Quinn successfully brokered a deal to buy a controlling stake in Sunderland.[34] In July 2006 Quinn became the chairman and manager of Sunderland.[35] The deal was finalised on 27 July 2006, with sufficient shares being sold to the consortium in order for them to take complete control.\n\nHis managerial career did not get off to a good start as the team lost its first four league games in a row. On 22 August, Sunderland played Bury away in the League Cup where they lost 2\u20130.[36] After the match Quinn said that a new manager would be appointed by Sunderland's next game. Quinn stepped to one side (to continue in his role as Sunderland chairman) paving the way for Roy Keane to take charge. This was highly unexpected considering the huge rift between the two arising from Keane's infamous ejection from the 2002 World Cup. Keane was appointed manager of the club on 28 August 2006. The appointment matured into a great success, with Sunderland clinching an immediate Premier League comeback as Football League Championship champions. Quinn made substantial amounts of money available for buying new players, as he had a declared ambition to establish Sunderland as a top club.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2008, he received the James Joyce Award of the Literary & Historical Society in University College Dublin.\n\nIn 2010, Quinn was named a patron of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.[37]\n\nIn October 2011 Ellis Short replaced Quinn as chairman of Sunderland. Quinn was appointed as Director of International Development on behalf of the club[38] and remained in this role until stepping down in February 2012 and after six years involved with the running of the club saying \"Everything is in place for Sunderland to really make a statement, which was always my aim\".[39]\n\nSince leaving Sunderland, Quinn is now chairman of a satellite broadband company in Ireland called Q Sat.[40]\n\nIn 2012, Quinn started commentating for Sky Sports and normally commentates alongside Martin Tyler.[citation needed]\nHe won, also in 2012, the North East Football Writers' Association's Personality of the Year for 2011.[41] In November 2013, Quinn was bestowed with the Freedom of Sunderland award by the city of Sunderland.[42]\n\nIn January 2020, Quinn was appointed as interim deputy chief executive officer of the Football Association of Ireland, choosing to go without salary until the financial future of the organisation could be secured.[43][44] In September 2020 he stepped down from his interim CEO role.[45]\n\nQuinn has his own song titled \"Niall Quinn's Disco Pants\". The song was originally created by Manchester City supporters during a night out on a pre-season tour in Penola, Italy, in 1992. There had been a bust-up with City team-mate Steve McMahon and Quinn had removed his torn and bloodied shirt and was dancing with Rick Holden wearing just a pair of cut-off jeans. He was \"hardly aware\" that there were a group of hardcore City fans watching and they treated him to \"the first performance of the song that will follow me till the end of my career.\"[11]\n\nThe song was adopted by Sunderland fans and released as a single by the club's dedicated fanzine A Love Supreme. It reached no. 56 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1999.[46]\n\nQuinn has received praise for his relationship with Sunderland fans. This was highlighted in March 2007 when, during his tenure as chairman, Quinn paid over \u00a38,000 out of club funds to allow around 80 Sunderland fans to travel home by taxi when stranded at Bristol airport after being ejected from their scheduled flight home. The incident happened on Saturday night when Quinn, Sunderland staff and a group of supporters boarded an easyJet flight from Bristol to Newcastle, following Sunderland's 1\u20130 win at Championship promotion rivals Cardiff. After spotting Quinn, many of the fans broke into song, serenading Quinn with 'Niall Quinn's Disco Pants'. \n\nThe EasyJet pilot alleged that a number of supporters were drunk and they were ejected from the plane. Quinn, outraged at the fans' treatment, also left the plane and commandeered a fleet of taxis and minivans to return the fans home.[47]\n\nBoth Quinn's parents are from Thurles, County Tipperary.[48] His father as well as his uncles on his mother's side played hurling for Tipperary.[48] He was born in Dublin.[1] He now lives in Kildare.[48] He has been married to the Irish model Gillian Roe since 1992,[49] and they have two children: Aisling and Michael.[50]\n\nIn 2005 Quinn was banned for driving for three months and ordered to pay a \u20ac200 fine after admitting drink-driving.[51]\n\nArsenal\n\nSunderland\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niall_Quinn"}, {"id": 221, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/101/2004609/original/sergei-ignashevich-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Sergei Ignashevich", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/sergei-ignashevich/2004609", "desc": "Sergei Nikolayevich Ignashevich (Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0418\u0433\u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, IPA: [s\u02b2\u026ar\u02c8g\u02b2ej n\u02b2\u026ak\u0250\u02c8la(j)\u026av\u02b2\u026at\u0255 \u026agn\u0250\u02c8\u0282\u025bv\u02b2\u026at\u0255]; born 14 July 1979) is a Russian football coach and a former central defender.

He is the manager of Baltika Kaliningrad.\n\nHe began his career at Torpedo Moscow, going up through the club's academy before briefly moving to twin club Spartak Moscow's academy and then starting his professional career with Spartak Orekhovo.\n\nHe played for Lokomotiv Moscow and CSKA Moscow in his career, and has won Russian Premier League titles for both clubs, as well as the 2005 UEFA Cup Final with CSKA. Ignashevich is often considered one of the highest skilled defenders in the Russian Premier League while playing alongside fellow Russian international defenders and twin brothers Aleksei and Vasili Berezutskiy.\n\nHe made his international debut for Russia in 2002, and was selected in their squads for two European Championships and two FIFA World Cups, helping them to the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2008, earning his 100th cap at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and as part of the host team reached the quarter-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. On 8 September 2015, he made his 110th international appearance and became the most capped player in Russia's team history, overtaking Viktor Onopko.[2] On 17 November 2015, he made his 114th appearance, making him the most capped Russian player for any national team (again, overtaking Onopko who played 4 additional games for CIS).[3]\n\nOn 2 April 2017, he played his 457th game in the Russian Premier League, setting a new record for most games played in the competition and overtaking the previous record holder Sergei Semak.[4] He held the record for most games played in the Russian first tier with 489, until he was overtaken by his former teammate Igor Akinfeev on 21 August 2021.[5]\n\nAfter short spells with Spartak Orekhovo and Krylia Sovetov, Ignashevich joined Lokomotiv Moscow in 2001. In his first season with the capital club, the defender was part of the team which won the Russian Cup. A year later, Lokomotiv won the Russian league title.[6]\n\nIn 2004, Ignashevich left Lokomotiv for city rivals CSKA. In his twelve years with the club, Ignashevich has won the 2005, 2006 and 2013 league titles, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2013 Russian Cups, and the 2004\u201305 UEFA Cup.[6]\n\nBoth Ignashevich and Aleksei Berezutskiy were provisionally suspended after both players' A samples revealed the presence of a prohibited substance following a random doping test after CSKA's UEFA Champions League match at Manchester United on 3 November 2009.[7] It was later revealed that they had taken a cold medicine which had not been reported, and both players were suspended for one game, which was applied retroactively.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing retirement after the 2018 World Cup, Ignashevich chose to remain with CSKA as a coach, specifically working within the youth set up at the club.[8]\n\nIgnashevich made his debut for the Russia national football team against Sweden on 21 August 2002.[9] He started all ten of the team's UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying matches, scoring three times, but missed the tournament finals in Portugal due to injury.[6] He later appeared for Russia at the 2008 and 2012 UEFA European Championships, helping the team to the semi-finals in the former.[9]\n\nOn 2 June 2014, Ignashevich was included in Russia's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad.[10] On 16 June, he made his FIFA World Cup debut in the team's first group match against South Korea.[11] He was then named in the starting line-up for the second match against Belgium  at the Maracan\u00e3 on 22 June.[12] He became only the second Russian, after Viktor Onopko, to earn his 100th cap, in the final group game against Algeria on 26 June in Curitiba. Russia drew 1\u20131 and their opponents advanced at their expense.[13]\n\nIgnashevich came out of international retirement prior to the 2018 FIFA World Cup as he was called up on 14 May 2018 to replace injured Ruslan Kambolov.[14] On 3 June 2018, he was included in the finalized World Cup squad.[15] He was one of only four players born in the 1970s to feature in the tournament, with the others being Tim Cahill (Australia), Rafael M\u00e1rquez (Mexico) and Essam El Hadary (Egypt).[16] Against Spain in the Round of Sixteen, he scored an own-goal while tangling with Sergio Ramos during a corner set-piece, but Russia would equalize thanks to a penalty, and in the shoot-out Ignashevich converted his spot kick to help Russia advance. Following Russia's elimination in the 2018 FIFA World Cup quarterfinal against Croatia after extra time ended deadlocked 2\u20132, where he successfully converted a shoot-out kick, Ignashevich announced his retirement from all forms of football.[17][18][19]\n\nAfter finishing his playing career, Ignashevich was appointed as administrator for the Under-21 squad of CSKA Moscow.[20]\n\nOn 4 June 2019, he became the manager of Torpedo Moscow, a few days after the club was promoted to the Football National League.[21] On 22 March 2021, he left Torpedo by mutual consent.[22]\n\nOn 2 October 2021, he was appointed a manager of the Football National League club FC Baltika.[23]\n\nIgnashevich is married and has three children.[24] He is of Chuvash and Belarusian origin.\n\n1Includes UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League.\n\n2Includes Russian Super Cup, Russian Premier League Cup and UEFA Super Cup.\n\nAs of 26 March 2023\n\nLokomotiv Moscow\n\nCSKA Moscow\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Ignashevich"}, {"id": 222, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/72/1428683/original/lee-sharpe-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Lee Sharpe", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/lee-sharpe/1428683", "desc": "Lee Stuart Sharpe (born 27 May 1971) is an English former professional footballer, sports television pundit and reality television personality, who as a player was predominantly a left winger from 1988 to 2004.\nSharpe joined Manchester United from Torquay United as a youngster in 1988, playing for the club up until 1996.

Sharpe moved to Leeds", "full_desc": "\n\nLee Stuart Sharpe (born 27 May 1971) is an English professional golfer, former professional footballer, sports television pundit and reality television personality.\n\nAs a player was predominantly a left winger from 1988 to 2004, he notably played in the Premier League for Manchester United, Leeds United and Bradford City and in Serie A for Sampdoria. He also had spells in the Football League with Torquay United, Portsmouth and Exeter City before wrapping his career up in Iceland with Grindav\u00edk and in non-league football with Garforth Town. Sharpe's spell at Manchester United lasted from 1988 until 1996 where he won several league titles, the FA Cup and the League Cup. He won a total of eight caps for England as well as one cap for the B team.\n\nHe retired from professional football in 2003, but achieved renewed fame after a number of reality television appearances. Notable appearances include Celebrity Wrestling, Celebrity Love Island, Dancing on Ice and a minor role in Coronation Street. He has also worked as a pundit largely abroad on international coverage of the Premier League for both ESPN Star and the Abu Dhabi Sports Channel.\n\nIn 2021, Sharpe began competing in professional golf tournaments.[1]\n\nSharpe, who was born in Halesowen, Worcestershire, was an Aston Villa supporter, but began his career at Torquay United. He played 14 times for the Gulls in the 1987-88 season as they achieved a secure finish in the Football League Fourth Division, and didn't turn 17 until just after the season's end. He was soon on the radar of First and Second Division clubs and was sold to Manchester United in June 1988 for \u00a3200,000, a record fee at the time for a YTS player.\n\nSharpe made his debut for Manchester United on 24 September 1988 in a 2\u20130 win over West Ham United in the Football League First Division, aged 17. His first team chances increased in November with the departure of the club's first choice left winger Jesper Olsen, and were further enhanced when new signing Ralph Milne performed inconsistently. Sharpe ended the 1988\u201389 season with 22 league appearances to his name, although he failed to score and United finished a disappointing 11th in the league a year after finishing second. He played 30 games in all competitions that season, and was on the shortlist for the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was won by Arsenal winger Paul Merson.[2]\n\nThe following season, Sharpe found the net for the first time in a United shirt, scoring in the 5\u20131 home win over Millwall on 16 September 1989. He managed 18 appearances in the league that season (and 20 in all competitions), but failed to make the squad for the FA Cup final which United won 1\u20130 against Crystal Palace in a replay after drawing 3\u20133 in the first match. Alex Ferguson had chosen new signing Danny Wallace as his first choice left winger for the 1989\u201390 season.[2]\n\nHe played a key part in United's success in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1990\u201391 scoring with a left-foot shot into the top corner in the home leg of the semi-final against Legia Warsaw (1\u20131). He also famously scored a hat-trick against Arsenal at Highbury in the League Cup fourth round on 28 November 1990, a match which United won 6\u20132. Sharpe himself cites this as one of the best memories in his footballing career.[citation needed] He was now United's first choice left winger ahead of Danny Wallace, although a new rival for the left wing position was emerging in the shape of highly promising 17-year-old Ryan Giggs.[3]\n\nHaving established himself as a left winger, Sharpe earned a call up to the England squad just before his 20th birthday, although he was unable to replace John Barnes as first choice left winger. He was then out of the game for long periods of time through injury and illness (he suffered from viral meningitis in the autumn of 1992) and when his fitness recovered, the form of Ryan Giggs meant he had normally to play out of position at left back (by now the preferred position for Denis Irwin) or on the right wing, competing for a place with Andrei Kanchelskis who had arrived in March 1991.\n\nHis first team opportunities were limited by injury and by the form of Giggs in the 1991-92 season, although he did appear as a substitute in the Football League Cup final victory over Nottingham Forest.\n\nHe did play in enough games to collect a Premier League title medal for the 1992\u201393 season, and added another in 1993\u201394 with 30 appearances (four as a substitute), and scoring nine league goals (11 in all competitions). He scored both of United's goals in their fourth league game of the season on 23 August 1993 as they beat Aston Villa 2\u20131 at Villa Park, following with an early goal in the 3\u20131 win at Southampton in the next game. He managed another double on 22 March 1994 in a 2\u20132 league draw at Arsenal, and came on as a substitute in the FA Cup final against Chelsea. United won the double of the Premier League title and FA Cup that season.\n\nSharpe is well remembered for his memorable goal against Barcelona during the 2\u20132 draw in the 1994\u20131995 Champions League season's group stage, when he spectacularly back-heeled a cross from Roy Keane into the corner of the net. He also got an assist in this game, crossing for Mark Hughes, who headed the first goal of the game.[4]\n\n1994\u201395 was a difficult season for United, with many players out for significant periods due to injury. Sharpe was one of them, as he missed a string of mid season games due to a fractured ankle, though he had more opportunities to play on the left wing as Ryan Giggs missed a quarter of the campaign due to injuries. He also made a number of appearances as left-back as the regular player in that position, Denis Irwin, spent most of the campaign playing on the right side of defence left vacant by a long absence by Paul Parker, though Irwin was back at left-back towards the end of the season following the emergence of right-back Gary Neville.\n\nUnited ended the season without a major trophy, finishing second to Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League as they failed to manage anything better than a 1\u20131 draw at West Ham on the final day of the season, and losing 1\u20130 to Everton in the FA Cup final.\n\nBy the start of the 1995\u201396, Andrei Kanchelskis had been sold to Everton and it seemed possible that Sharpe could establish himself as United's right winger \u2013 particularly when he scored twice for United in their 3\u20132 win over Everton on 9 September 1995.\n\nWith Ryan Giggs returning to fitness on the left wing, and Denis Irwin returning to left back following the emergence of Gary Neville as the club's regular right back, the right hand side of midfield seemed Sharpe's best opportunity of regular first team action. However, 20-year-old David Beckham made the first team breakthrough that season and left Sharpe facing a fresh battle for a regular place in the first team, though he was selected in the squad for all but eight competitive games that season, during which United became the first English team to win the double twice. He still took to the field in 31 out of 38 Premier League games, scoring four goals. His first goal of the season came at Blackburn Rovers on 28 August, as a relatively strong United side recorded their third successive league win after being beaten by Aston Villa on the opening day. In their next game at Everton on 9 September, Sharpe scored twice as United achieved an impressive 3\u20132 win. His next (and final) league goal for United came on 10 February 1996 when he scored the only goal of the game against Blackburn Rovers, as United kept up the pressure on leaders Newcastle who had been 10 points ahead at Christmas. Sharpe also managed two FA Cup goals that season, the winner against Manchester City in the fifth round at Old Trafford on 18 February, and the second in the last minute of a 2\u20130 home win over Southampton in the quarter finals on 11 March. He was selected as a substitute in the 1\u20130 FA Cup final win over Liverpool on 11 May, but did not come onto the pitch, though he still picked up his second FA Cup winner's medal, which was ultimately the last major trophy of his career just before his 25th birthday.[2] In total he played 265 games for Manchester United over eight years, scoring 36 goals and winning a total of seven major trophies.\n\nAfter eight years at Old Trafford, he became Leeds United's joint record signing on 10 August 1996 when they paid \u00a34.5million for his services, making him the last signing by manager Howard Wilkinson, who was sacked the following month to be succeeded by George Graham. Again his time at Leeds was beset by further injuries. He made 26 Premiership appearances in 1996\u201397, scoring five goals, but a pre-season knee injury ruled him out for the entire 1997\u201398 season and he was unable to regain his place in the team on recovery. In the autumn of 1998, Graham's successor David O'Leary loaned Sharpe to Italian Serie A strugglers Sampdoria, where he played under English head coach David Platt, but soon fell out of favour and in the New Year he returned to England.\n\nHe signed on loan for Bradford City in March 1999 and he helped in securing the club's promotion to the Premiership after 77 years outside the top division. He joined Bradford in a \u00a3250,000 deal during the summer and helped preserve the club's Premiership status in 1999\u20132000.\n\nIn 2000\u201301, Sharpe lost his place in the Bradford team and just before Christmas went on loan to Division One Portsmouth. He played 17 matches. He returned to Bradford during the 2001\u201302 season but when his contract expired at the end of the season he was given a free transfer.\n\nFollowing a brief trial stay with Grimsby Town in the summer of 2002 he was snubbed a contract with the Mariners and he eventually signed for Exeter City. During his time at Exeter he scored once against Hull City. This would prove to be Sharpe's final spell in English senior football at the age of 31.[5]\n\nHe then moved to Grindav\u00edk in Iceland. In June 2003 he announced his retirement from professional football at the age of 32. Just before this, he was rumoured to be on the verge of taking over as player-manager at Bury in Division Three.[6]\n\nIn February 2004, Sharpe made a brief return to football in the Kidderminster Sunday League with Hoobrook Crown before signing for Northern Counties East Premier League side Garforth Town the following summer.\n\nSharpe was capped eight times by England between 1991 and 1993.\n\nSharpe has also developed a career in reality television. He appeared as a competitor in the 2005, ITV television show Celebrity Wrestling, under the name \"Sharpe Shooter\". He is also known though for appearing in Celebrity Love Island in 2005. During his time on the island, Sharpe courted the attentions of many of the show's ladies, most notably TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss, who confessed to \"never having felt like this before about someone\", but Sharpe eventually dated Abi Titmuss.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007 Sharpe appeared as a contestant in ITV's Dancing on Ice. He was eliminated from the competition on 3 March 2007. He was to also appear in ITV's popular TV soap Coronation Street as an extra in the fictional pub \"The Rovers Return\" as a working class taxi driver from Manchester.[citation needed]\n\nSharpe, alongside former Bucks Fizz singer Cheryl Baker, currently fronts a London Underground advertising campaign for Nourkrin, a baldness treatment. He is billed as \"Of Celebrity Love Island fame!\"\n\nIn 2008, Sharpe starred in Dec's team on Ant versus Dec, on Saturday Night Takeaway ITV1. Sharpe also starred as the celebrity 'hider' in an episode of the CBBC show Hider in the House. He also appeared in the 2008 television series Superstars on Channel Five.\n\nIn August 2009, he appeared in the RT\u00c9 One celebrity boxing series, Charity Lords of the Ring.[7]\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, Sharpe featured in both seasons of ITV show Harry's Heroes, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting to get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.[8]\n\nAfter retirement in 2004 and 2006, Sharpe became a football pundit for ESPN Star in Singapore in Asia, and together with Les Ferdinand, is a celebrity host on the game show \"Kickoff\".[citation needed] Sharpe was previously a pundit on BBC's Match of the Day 2 and Football Focus, and during the 2006 World Cup presented a vlog for Yahoo.[citation needed] Sharpe appeared in one episode of the football drama Dream Team.[citation needed]\n\nSharpe was one of the football pundits hired by Abu Dhabi Sports Channel, for their exclusive coverage of the Premier League.[citation needed]\n\nIn the early 1990s, Sharpe was part of a new direction in football that saw photogenic players like himself, Jamie Redknapp and Ryan Giggs emerge as merchandising and mass marketed \"poster boys\" of the game, and fronted many football magazine covers and featured in advertisements. By the mid-1990s, these players, some of whom ( notably the Liverpool FA cup final team dressed in white suits before the game) had become known as Spice Boys, had become icons in football already, in an era when football stars had become idols on par with rock stars and pop stars.[9] Sharpe was known for his lifestyle off the pitch as much as he had on it at the time, though these endorsement deals quieted down after he left Manchester United in 1996.\n\nOn 25 August 2005, Sharpe's autobiography My Idea of Fun was published, describing his time as a footballer and his resulting celebrity status.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 2021, Sharpe and his family moved to X\u00e0bia, Spain. That December, he opened a sports bar named \"Sharpey's\".[10]\n\nManchester United\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sharpe"}, {"id": 223, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Sergei Ostapenko", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/sergei-ostapenko/2004710", "desc": "Sergei Sergeyevich Ostapenko (Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e) (born 23 February 1986) is a former Kazakh footballer, whose last team was FC Astana.", "full_desc": "\n\nSergei Sergeyevich Ostapenko (Russian: \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u041e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e) (born 23 February 1986) is a former Kazakh footballer, whose last team was FC Astana.\n\nIn 2003, Ostapenko had graduated from FC Almaty (FC Tsesna at that time) football academy and had been starting in the first team since then, before his transfer to FC Tobol in 2007.

The Belgian team's manager noted that the duo's youth, international experience and physical characteristics were key motivations for signing the pair.[1] However, Ostapenko's European adventure was not particularly successful and he did not start a single game for the reds, only playing in the reserve team.

He was capped five times at senior level for Scotland during the 1980s, scoring one goal.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Scotland, McAvennie grew up in Milton and attended St. Augustine's School also in Milton.[1][2][3]\n\nMcAvennie started his playing career in Scottish Junior League football. In 1979 during an amateur game with a local side, the 200 Club, in Kirkintilloch, McAvennie, playing well, came to the attention of local scouts. He was recommended to local junior side Johnstone Burgh signing for them for a \u00a3500 fee.[3] He completed a trial for Partick Thistle playing in a single game where he was sent on as a substitute only to be substituted off in the same game and be told by manager Bertie Auld that he would never make a career in the game of football.[3] Before turning professional, he had joined the Territorial Army and later had trials with the British Army but was not accepted for a role with them due to his inability to hit the target during shooting practices.[4] He also had a spell working as a road sweeper.[1] He did not move into professional football until he joined St Mirren in 1980, at the age of 20. His league debut came in the 1981\u201382 season in a 4\u20133 defeat of Airdrieonians. Playing as a Midfielder, McAvennie scored two goals.[5] In 1982, he was named Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year.[6] He would make 135 league appearances for them over the next five years, scoring 48 goals.\n\nHis strong form in Scotland attracted attention from south of the border and McAvennie had talks with Luton Town and their manager, David Pleat, in the summer of 1985. With talks progressing well McAvennie decided not to sign for Luton due to the attitude of their chairman, David Evans.[7] With St Mirren then agreeing a fee with West Ham United, McAvennie met with their manager John Lyall and his staff and he signed for them in June 1985 for \u00a3340,000. He made his West Ham debut on 17 August 1985, the opening game of the season, in a 1\u20130 away defeat to Birmingham City with his first two goals coming in his second game, a 3\u20131 home defeat of Queens Park Rangers.[8] Originally signed as an attacking midfielder he was played as an out-and-out striker after an injury to Paul Goddard in the opening game of the season. He would go on to keep Goddard out of the team and spark his transfer from the club the following season.[9]\n[10][11] He formed a formidable partnership with young English striker Tony Cottee with McAvennie scoring 26 league goals and Cottee 20.[12][13] One additional goal in both the League Cup and the FA Cup saw his tally rise to 28 goals in 51 appearances in all competitions.[11]\nIn his first season, he helped West Ham to their highest ever final position in English football when they came third, just four points behind champions Liverpool.[12] His 26 goals in the league was only bettered by Gary Lineker, who found the net 30 times for second-placed Everton.[14][15]\n\nAt this time McAvennie's success on the pitch came to the attention of TV producers. He appeared on the BBC's Wogan show, hosted by Terry Wogan, an event which McAvennie claims changed his life and introduced him to a celebrity lifestyle. He is quoted as saying \"Then I signed for West Ham and money and girls were thrown at me and, hey, who was I to say no? Then I went on Wogan and it really took off. I was never under any illusions why it was happening. It wisnae because of my looks, it was because I was a footballer.\"[15]\n\nWest Ham were denied UEFA Cup action for the following season due to the ban on English clubs in European competitions, which had started a year earlier due to the Heysel disaster.[16]\nThe following season was less successful as they finished 15th as McAvennie scored just seven league goals from 36 games and eleven from 47 games in all competitions. He began the 1987\u201388 season still at West Ham.[11][17]\n\nMcAvennie played eight games for the Hammers at the start of 1987\u201388, failing to score, before he moved to Celtic for a then club record fee of \u00a3750,000 on 2 October 1987.[18] Graeme Souness had approached him to join rival club Rangers at the 1986 FIFA World Cup which would have made him the first Catholic player to play for the Protestant club, but he refused, being a supporter of Celtic.[19] He made his debut for Celtic the following day in a 1\u20131 draw at home against Hibernian.\n\nMcAvennie made a slow start at Celtic and his progress was not helped when he got involved in an on-field fracas with Chris Woods, Terry Butcher and Graham Roberts in an Old Firm game in November 1987.[18][13] McAvennie and Woods were sent off in the initial incident, whilst Butcher was sent off later in the game. All four were later reported to the Procurator Fiscal and appeared in court on disorder charges relating to their conduct in that game. McAvennie was found not guilty, Roberts not proven, whilst Butcher and Woods were both convicted of Breach of the Peace.[20]\n\nMcAvennie eventually found his form at Parkhead, and his 15 goals in 1987\u201388 helped Celtic to a Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup double. That season (the club's centenary season), he was part of a formidable front trio for Celtic comprising himself, Andy Walker and Joe Miller.[18][21] One of the high-points during the season for McAvennie were his two goals in Celtic's 2\u20130 win over Rangers in January 1988.[22] The Cup Final in May was particularly memorable for McAvennie as he scored two late goals to beat Dundee United 2\u20131, the winning goal coming in the final minute.[23]\n\nThe following season, 1988\u201389, was not a happy one for Celtic and the team finished in third place in the league behind winners Rangers and second-placed Aberdeen. McAvennie, however, was one of Celtic's few form players that season and he'd scored 11 goals by Christmas 1988. However, a broken arm sustained in the New Year game at Ibrox against Rangers curtailed his goalscoring. McAvennie also wished to return to London to enable him to spend more time with then girlfriend, glamour model Jenny Blyth.[18] After a public row with manager Billy McNeill over being dropped for a league match at Tynecastle in March 1989 against Hearts,[24] Celtic relented to McAvennie's repeated requests for a transfer[25] and sold him back to West Ham.[26]\n\nMcAvennie returned to West Ham United in March 1989 in a \u00a31.25 million deal, making him their record signing. His weekly wages were \u00a32,200, his highest ever weekly wage as a footballer.[27] According to Celtic manager Billy McNeill's autobiography, McAvennie wanted to return to London and his model girlfriend Jenny Blyth. McAvennie claims in his autobiography that Celtic were refusing to pay him a signing-on fee. Just before his return to Boleyn Ground, Celtic had accepted an offer from title chasing Arsenal, whose manager George Graham was looking for a proven goalscorer to partner Alan Smith. However, McAvennie turned down the chance to join Arsenal and accepted John Lyall's offer shortly afterwards. While Arsenal went on to dramatically win the First Division title on the last day of the season, West Ham were relegated to the Second Division and McAvennie failed to score a single goal in the remaining nine games of the season.[11] He has since admitted that his decision to join West Ham and not Arsenal was based on his love of the club and not on the likelihood of footballing success.[28]\n\nHis second spell in London was not as successful as his previous one. Now playing in the Second Division, things got worse for both McAvennie and West Ham when the striker suffered a broken leg on the opening game of the season on 19 August 1989, following a challenge by Stoke City's Chris Kamara, which put him out until March 1990.[11] He made his return on 31 March 1990 against Port Vale. By this time West Ham were 10th in the league and ultimately finished in seventh place missing out on the playoffs. This unsettling period at Upton Park also saw manager Lou Macari resign and being succeeded by Billy Bonds.[29]\n\nIn the aftermath of his injury, it was alleged in the tabloid press that McAvennie had threatened legal action against Kamara. This did not materialise and McAvennie has stated he had no intention of litigation.[30] Kamara's view was that his challenge was innocuous and perfectly good and that McAvennie has created \"many lies and false recollections\" concerning the tackle. McAvennie recalls in his autobiography, Scoring, An Expert's Guide, that Kamara had \"come straight through him, crumpling him to the ground\" and had then stood over him saying \"Get up you Scottish bastard, this is a man's game\". The tackle resulted in a broken leg, shattered ankle and torn ligaments for McAvennie who had two plates and a bolt inserted in his ankle and another plate in his leg. Incensed by the tackle some supporters of West Ham sent death threats to Kamara.[31][32][33] Out injured, on pain-killers and with spare-time on his hands McAvennie visited London's nightclubs to take his mind off his injuries and the boredom of not playing football. At these venues he was introduced to cocaine to which he became addicted.[34]\n\nMcAvennie was fully fit for the 1990\u201391 season. His first goal in his second spell for West Ham and his first since April 1987 game on 29 August 1990 in a 1\u20131 home game against Portsmouth; the second game of the season.[11] West Ham won promotion from the Second Division and reached the 1990\u201391 FA Cup semi-finals.[11] He played 34 league games and scored 10 goals, now partnering Trevor Morley up front (his previous West Ham strike partner Tony Cottee had departed to Everton in August 1988).\n\nThe 1991\u201392 season was a disappointing one for both West Ham and McAvennie. He scored only three league goals in the first half of the season with West Ham never out of the bottom three after Christmas. He also faced competition for a regular place from new signing Mike Small.[11] On 2 May 1992, he signed off in style at West Ham, scoring a hat-trick in his final match against Nottingham Forest having come on as a substitute for Mitchell Thomas.[35] West Ham had already been relegated in 22nd and bottom place. His tally in a frustrating season for both the player and the club was just six goals from 20 league games.[36][37]\n\nMcAvennie then accepted an offer from Ron Atkinson to sign for Aston Villa on a free transfer, but played just three games in the new Premier League, as the partnership of Dalian Atkinson and early season signing Dean Saunders saw Villa emerge as title challengers. Villa finally finished runners-up to Manchester United.[38] McAvennie did not score for Villa. He left in January 1993 to rejoin Celtic, who were now lagging behind a dominant Rangers side on their way to a fifth successive league title.[39]\n\nMcAvennie played one game for Irish League club Cliftonville in 1992, scoring in a County Antrim Shield semi-final.[40] McAvennie was then offered a contract with Hong Kong side South China. Despite being well received by the local fans and management, he found the standard of football to be unchallenging. He played only one senior game for South China, then he returned to the United Kingdom.[41][42]\n\nOn hearing of his exit from Hong Kong, John Lambie agreed terms with McAvennie to sign for Partick Thistle. Although a press conference to announce the signing was arranged at Firhill Stadium, Celtic manager, Liam Brady, hearing he was available, persuaded him to sign for his former club which he did in January 1993.[43][44]\nHe scored nine goals in 19 league games that season,[39] though Celtic could only manage a third-place finish as Rangers secured their fifth successive title.\n\nIn 1993\u201394, McAvennie managed just 11 league appearances, scoring once, as he lost his place in the team following Liam Brady's departure and the appointment of Lou Macari as manager. In February 1994, Macari loaned McAvennie to English Premier League strugglers Swindon Town, and he made just seven league appearances and failed to score as the Robins were relegated in bottom place at the end the 1993\u201394 season in which they managed only five wins and conceded 100 goals. A highlight of his spell at the County Ground came on 19 March 1994 when he helped the Robins hold league leaders (and eventual double winners) Manchester United to a 2\u20132 draw.[45]\n\nHe then left Celtic for a second time and signed for Falkirk, newly promoted to the Scottish Premier Division for 1994\u201395, and scoring twice in three games before dropping down a division and returning to St Mirren on a free transfer on 14 October 1994.[46] He played seven games for St Mirren that season, failing to score, before retiring as a player at the age of 35. In a professional career which had stretched for 15 years, he managed a total of 136 goals in the English and Scottish leagues, combined with many more in the cups and also in Europe for Celtic.\n\nMcAvennie was called into the Scotland national team late 1985 for the World Cup qualifying play-off with Australia at Hampden Park on 20 November. Following a 58th-minute goal by Davie Cooper, McAvennie scored in the 60th minute on what was his international debut. The game finished 2\u20130 to Scotland.[47][48][13] In the return leg in Melbourne on 4 December 1985, which was McAvennie's 2nd international appearance, the game finished 0-0 resulting in Scotland qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup.[49][50] Having travelled with Scotland to Australia he returned to the UK and only three days later scored the only goal for West Ham in a 1\u20130 win at Loftus Road against Queens Park Rangers.[51]\n\nHe was called up to the Scotland national team for the 1986 World Cup, under interim national coach Alex Ferguson. He made two appearances in the World Cup in Mexico, both as a substitute and both defeats, to Denmark and to West Germany.[52][53] He won five caps for Scotland, the last against Saudi Arabia in February 1988 in a 2\u20132 draw in Riyadh.[54]\n\nDuring his playing career he reputedly enjoyed a playboy lifestyle involving drink, drugs and womanising.[15][13][55] His lifestyle was the inspiration for a parody character played by Jonathan Watson in the Scottish comedy TV programme, Only an Excuse?[13][56]\n\nIn 2000, having been cleared in court of an incident involving the supply of controlled drugs,[13][57] McAvennie found himself in severe financial difficulties and resorted to selling his medals to Celtic-supporting businessman Willie Haughey for a small sum; these were later returned to him in 2017.[57]\n\nOn 12 January 2009, McAvennie received a four-month suspended sentence for affray following an incident in July 2008 in which he head-butted a man in Douglas on the Isle of Man.[58]\n\nSt Mirren\n\nCeltic\n\nWest Ham United\n\nIndividual\n\n\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_McAvennie"}, {"id": 226, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Damien Plessis", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/damien-plessis/10166527", "desc": "Damien J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jean Richard Plessis (born 5 March 1988) is a French footballer who lastly played for \u00d6rebro SK in the Swedish Allsvenskan.

He's only a young boy with plenty of time to work on his game but it depends on his progress how quickly he can force his way into the first team\".[7]\n\nPlessis made his debut for Liverpool on 5 April 2008 in the 1\u20131 away draw against Arsenal.[9] Rafa Ben\u00edtez described his performance by saying \"Today was the debut for Damien Plessis. We knew when we signed him that he was a quality player.

Coming on as a substitute, he also stepped up to take the first penalty kick in the shootout against Manchester United, after the match finished goalless; his effort was saved by Ben Foster as Spurs lost 1\u20134 on penalties.[14] O'Hara signed a new contract in August, keeping him at White Hart Lane until 2013.[15]\n\nAfter penning a new deal with Tottenham, O'Hara joined Portsmouth on loan until January 2010, with an option to remain at Fratton Park until the end of the season.[16] He was a regular starter for Pompey during this time, but returned to Tottenham in January 2010 despite Portsmouth wanting to extend his loan and Tottenham agreeing to this, as Portsmouth were subject to a transfer embargo. Following the lifting of Portsmouth's transfer embargo weeks later, he returned to Portsmouth on loan for the remainder of the season.[17]\n\nHis loan spell created a conflict of interests when Portsmouth were drawn to play the winners of the Tottenham/Fulham tie in the FA Cup semi-finals. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp gave a stern reminder to O'Hara that his ultimate loyalties lie with Tottenham after the midfielder admitted he hoped Spurs lost to Fulham as he would not be eligible to play against Tottenham.[18] Tottenham did indeed progress to the semi-final, meaning O'Hara was denied a chance to play in the Wembley match. However, Portsmouth won the game 2\u20130 giving him a chance to play in the FA Cup Final where they were beaten 1\u20130 by Chelsea. At end of the season O'Hara was voted Portsmouth's Player of the Season for 2009\u201310.[citation needed]\n\nHaving sustained a stress fracture during the 2009\u201310 season, it was announced in August 2010 that O'Hara was to undergo back surgery.[19] This kept him out contention for any first team football until the New Year.\n\nOn 30 January 2011, O'Hara joined Premier League side Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan for the rest of the 2010\u201311 season, with view to a permanent deal.[20] O'Hara made his Wolves debut as a substitute against Bolton Wanderers three days later.[citation needed] He made his first start on 5 February 2011, playing 60 minutes of a 2\u20131 victory against league leaders Manchester United.[citation needed] He scored his first goal for Wolves against local rivals West Bromwich Albion on 20 February 2011.[citation needed] He scored on the final day of the season, in a 2\u20133 defeat against Blackburn Rovers, which helped Wolves narrowly avoid relegation.[21] The season concluded with him picking up the Goal of the Season Award, for his strike against local rivals West Bromwich Albion.[22]\n\nOn 21 June 2011, it was announced that O'Hara had signed a five-year contract with Wolves for an undisclosed fee,[23] initially reported to be around \u00a35\u00a0million.[24] It was later reported that the actual fee Wolves paid for O'Hara was \u00a33.5\u00a0million, not the \u00a35\u00a0million quoted.[25] He decided to move to Wolves permanently after missing out on first team football for Tottenham.\n\nO'Hara's first full season with the club saw him miss several months of the campaign after twice undergoing surgery, firstly on a double hernia,[26] then to correct a persistent groin problem.[27] He did not return to first team action until January 2013,[citation needed] by which time the club were back in the Championship and had undergone a series of manager changes.\n\nThe midfielder made 21 appearances during the second half of the 2012\u201313 season[citation needed] but was unable to halt a second successive relegation.[citation needed] In April 2013, he was sent off for violent conduct in a defeat to Huddersfield Town, which ruled him out for three games.[28] Upon his return at the final game of the season that confirmed relegation, O'Hara responded to jeers from the Wolves fans by sarcastically clapping them.[citation needed] He had previously clashed with fans in March 2012 after being confronted by a group outside Molineux.[29]\n\nFollowing the arrival of Kenny Jackett as manager, it was announced in June 2013 that O'Hara had been made available for transfer.[30] At the beginning of the upcoming season, O'Hara was not allocated a squad number and Jackett reiterated that he remained outside his plans.[31] However, by late October, with no interest from other clubs,[32] Jackett stated that \"the last four months have humbled him (O'Hara)\" and that \"everyone at the club is willing to give him a second chance\".[33] O'Hara was thus given a squad number and withdrawn from the transfer list.[34] He made his playing return in a 2\u20132 draw at Carlisle and also featured in the following game.[35]\n\nO'Hara fell out of first team contention after these appearances with manager Kenny Jackett citing his lack of fitness.[36] He spent a short trial period at Blackpool in late November 2013 but they did not pursue their interest in taking him on loan.[37][38] Without any involvement in Wolves' first team for several months, O'Hara requested that Wolves permit him to undertake an intense three-week training programme (at his own expense) at a training facility in Los Angeles, which he did in February 2014.[39] After returning, he featured as an over-age player for Wolves' under-21 games, with Kenny Jackett saying that he was \"surprised nobody has taken him\" and that hoped that \"somebody wants to take a chance (on O'Hara)\" before the close of the loan window.[40] However, the only reported loan interest came from his former club Portsmouth, now near the foot of League Two, but no deal was agreed.[41]\n\nShortly after having not been issued a squad number for the new season, on 28 August 2014 O'Hara's contract was terminated with immediate effect by mutual consent.[42]\n\nOn 5 November 2014, O'Hara joined Blackpool on a short-term contract until 4 January 2015.[43] He made his debut against Leeds United on 8 November in a 3\u20131 loss.[44] On 8 January 2015 O'Hara extended his deal at Blackpool until the end of the season.[45]\n\nOn 7 July 2015, O'Hara joined Fulham on a one-year contract.[46]\nO'Hara made his debut for Fulham in the opening game of the season in a 1\u20131 draw against Cardiff City. He scored his first goal for Fulham in a 3\u20132 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday on 19 September 2015.[47] O'Hara was released on 9 June 2016.[48]\n\nOn 12 August 2016 O'Hara signed for Gillingham on a two-year contract.[49] On 30 September 2016, the club and player mutually agreed to terminate his contract after his failure to recover from an ongoing injury.[50]\n\nOn 23 March 2017, BBC Sport confirmed that O'Hara had joined Billericay Town of the Isthmian League Premier Division, in the seventh tier of English football.[51] The article also went on to report that \"Billericay have recently been taken over by multi-millionaire Glenn Tamplin, who said shortly after completing a deal for the club that he was \"comfortable\" investing \u00a310,000 a week.\"[51] It was also revealed that O'Hara has agreed to forfeit his wages if he gets injured and that a clause will allow him to leave if a \"Championship or above\" club comes in for him.[51]\n\nOn 16 April 2017, it was announced that O'Hara had been fined two weeks wages by Billericay for getting into a physical altercation with a young supporter following a 3\u20132 defeat by Leatherhead on 15 April 2017.[52]\n\nO'Hara left Billericay Town in December 2018,[53] but returned to the club a month later as player/assistant manager.[54] He became player-manager in September 2019.[55]\n\nOn 3 December 2020, it was announced that O'Hara and his Assistant Manager Paul Konchesky had both parted company with Billericay Town.[56]\n\nO'Hara was called up to the England under-21 squad for their game against Republic of Ireland on 5 February 2008, but did not take the field.[57] He did gain his first U21 cap on 25 March 2008, in a 0\u20130 friendly against Poland.[58] In total he won seven caps at this level.[citation needed]\n\nOn 21 February 2011, O'Hara admitted that he would seriously consider playing international football for the Republic of Ireland if he got the call. O'Hara has played at the England under-21 level but has never been selected for the senior squad and with Irish grandparents, he could now make the switch. Former Wolves manager Mick McCarthy also expressed that he too wished O'Hara to make the switch to Ireland.[59]\n\nHe is also eligible for Northern Ireland via his father who was born in Magherafelt.[60]\n\nO'Hara married former Miss England model Danielle Lloyd on 26 May 2012.[61] They had three sons together.[62] Lloyd filed for divorce in 2014, after O'Hara had admitted to cheating on her on a night out.[63]\n\nOut of contract after leaving Gillingham, he participated in series 19 of the reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother in January 2017.[64] In September 2021, he became host of Talksport's The Sports Bar alongside Jason Cundy.[65]\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nPortsmouth\n\nBillericay Town\n\nIndividual\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_O%27Hara_(footballer)"}, {"id": 234, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Rocus Lamare", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/rocus-lamare/63243493", "desc": "Rocus Lamare is an Indian football player.

after providing the assist for Pape Abou Ciss\u00e9's early equaliser, he won and then converted the late penalty that gave his side a 4\u20133 win.[35] In March 2018, Fortounis opened the scoring with a penalty in the home derby with Panathinaikos, played behind closed doors as punishment for misbehaviour by supporters; the match ended 1\u20131.[36] He finished the season with 37 appearances (11 goals, 14 assists) in all competitions.\n\nHe was named Olympiacos captain in August 2018.[37] He contributed two goals and an assist to his team beating 10-man Burnley in the Europa League play-off round.[38] After two goals and an assist in a 5\u20131 defeat of F91 Dudelange in the Europa League group stage in November 2018, Fortounis was named in the tournament's Team of the Week.[39] On 13 December against AC Milan, he converted an 81st-minute penalty that gave Olympiacos the two-goal winning margin needed to qualify for the knockout rounds.[40] On 30 January 2019, Fortounis scored a hat-trick at home to Larissa, and three weeks later scored twice in a 4\u20131 win at home to champions AEK Athens.[12] His free kick on 21 April 2019 in a 3\u20131 away win against Lamia was in vain as PAOK beat Levadiakos to secure the Superleague title.[41] Fortounis finished the season with 43 appearances (17 goals, 16 assists) in all competitions.\n\nFortounis agreed a new four-year contract in June 2019.[42] In July, he suffered a ruptured cruciate ligament and was expected to be out for six months.[43]\n\nOn 15 January 2020, after a very difficult year for the Greek international marred by injury (184 days to be exact), Fortounis made his return as a substitute in a 4\u20131 home Greek Cup last 16 game against Kalamata.[44]\nOn 15 February 2020, he scored his first goal after his serious injury for the 2019\u201320 season, in stylish fashion as the Greek international skipped passed them with a minimum of fuss before scoring with an emphatic shot in a hammering 4\u20130 home win against Panionios.[45] Fortounis finished the season with 21 appearances (3 goals, 3 assists) in all competitions.\n\nOn 18 September 2020, in the 2020-21 Super League Greece opener game, the entry of Fortounis in the beginning of the second half, along with his first goal in the season, changed the image of the match and Olympiakos started the championship with a 3-0 home win against Asteras Tripoli.[46] On 24 October 2020, according to club's reports, Fortounis rejected a \u20ac3 million per year offer for a three-year contract from Saudi Arabia club Al Nassr FC.[47] Fortounis finished the season with 46 appearances (9 goals, 11 assists) in all competitions.\n\nOn 27 June 2021,  he twisted into an unsuspecting phase during the first test match against Wolfsberger AC, resulting in a cruciate ligament rupture in his left knee.

Showing plenty of maturity against the Belgians, Fortounis was also given test runs against Slovenia and Armenia in the final two Greece friendlies ahead of UEFA Euro 2012. Strong runs down the left flank in Greece's friendlies allowed Fortounis to form a strong bond with the likes of Giorgos Karagounis and Jos\u00e9 Holebas down the left side; thus forming a strong chemistry between the trio all the while improving Greece's transition game and attack.[49] Eventually was picked in the Greece squad for Euro 2012.[citation needed]\n\nFortounis was not a part of the Greece national team squad for 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[50] Eventually his transfer to Olympiacos was beneficial for his career.

Fortounis\u2019 speed on and off the ball make him an efficient player to have in the line-up as his time with the ball usually creates an attack for his team. His speed is another factor that is to his benefit, as he is able to burst past markers with flair and trickery. He describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one-on-ones.[49]\n\nAs of 13 February 2023[54][55]\n\nOlympiacos\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostas_Fortounis"}, {"id": 240, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3105/62091708/original/kingshuk-debnath-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Kingshuk Debnath", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/kingshuk-debnath/62091708", "desc": "Kinshuk Debnath (born 8 May 1985) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a defender for East Bengal F.C. in the I-League.\nThe highly experienced stopper back started his football journey in the local Srirampur league at the age of 15.

A forward, he won nine caps for England between 1971 and 1973, scoring one international goal.\n\nBrought up in the East End of London, he played youth football for West Ham United before he made his professional debut with Fulham in March 1963. He scored 22 goals in 63 First Division games before falling out with the management and taking a \u00a315,000 transfer to Queens Park Rangers in March 1966. He helped the club to the 1967 League Cup and to consecutive promotions through the Third Division and Second Division. In March 1972 he was sold to Manchester City for \u00a3200,000. He featured in the 1974 League Cup final defeat but his time in Manchester was largely disappointing and he left the UK the following year to play for American club Tampa Bay Rowdies.\n\nHe had a successful career with the Rowdies and went on to coach the club from 1984 to 1986 after previously having brief spells coaching New York United and the Carolina Lightnin'. In the 1990s he began work as a broadcaster on Sky Sports, before he was sacked in January 2005. Since that time he has appeared on numerous reality television shows, and helped to run an American-based property development company with his son. In 2015, Marsh started co-hosting a radio show about football on SiriusXM, titled Grumpy Pundits. His co-host is Irish broadcaster Tommy Smyth.\n\nMarsh was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire to Lilian Dredge, a housewife, and William Marsh, a docker.[2] He grew up in Palatine Road, Stoke Newington, and his parents only spent a few days in Hertfordshire so his mother could avoid going into labour during the Blitz.[2] Marsh had a rough upbringing as a child, particularly from his father, and in his autobiography said that this tough upbringing left him emotionally traumatised.[3] His father came from an even more violent family, and was partially crippled at the age of 19 after being attacked by his father with a hammer.[4] An only child, Marsh described his family as \"incredibly poor\" and until the age of 11 he slept in the corner of his parents' bedroom \u2013 the family shared a three-storey house with two other families and the only other room they had was a living room.[5] He attended Arsenal matches at Highbury with his father, and also went along to see reserve team matches.[6] The family's poverty came to an end just as Marsh was beginning his professional football career \u2013 his father helped the landlord to fill out his weekly pool coupon, and the landlord had a massive win shortly before his death and left the house to Marsh's father in his will.[7]\n\nMarsh played alongside Ron \"Chopper\" Harris for Hackney Schools, scoring all three goals as Hackney won the schools national championship.[8] His father secured him a trial for the West Ham United under-16s, and he impressed enough to land himself a place in the academy.[6] However, he was released after ten months by Wally St Pier, who let Marsh go to open up a place on the youth team for Geoff Hurst.[9] Soon before his sixteenth birthday, Marsh was spotted by scout Bill Brown, who offered him a place in Fulham's youth programme.[10]\n\nMarsh began his career with First Division side Fulham, and made his debut against Aston Villa at Craven Cottage on 23 March 1963 after Johnny Haynes picked up an injury.[11][12] He scored the winning goal on his debut with a volley from a George Cohen cross, prompting manager Bedford Jezzard to state that \"No boy could have had a better first game\".[11][12] Haynes returned to the starting line-up the next week, but Marsh was accommodated with the number eight shirt.[12]\n\nIn September 1963, he collided with John Sjoberg whilst scoring a winning goal against Leicester City and was ruled out of action for ten months with a broken jaw and skull.[13] The incident left him with a permanent loss of hearing in his left ear.[11] For weeks he was unable to keep his balance whilst standing, and he was told by one specialist that he would never play football again.[13]\n\nHe returned to fitness in the 1964\u201365 season and was utilized at centre forward, and formed an effective partnership with Haynes to secure 17 goals to become the club's top-scorer.[14] However manager Bedford Jezzard left the club and Marsh did not get along with new boss Vic Buckingham.[14] He ridiculed Buckingham, who in turn froze Marsh out of the first team.[15]\n\nMarsh moved across West London to join Queens Park Rangers, then in the Third Division, after manager Alec Stock paid out a \u00a315,000 fee in March 1966.[16] QPR finished third at the end of the 1965\u201366 campaign, eight points outside promoted Millwall.\n\nHis first full season with Rangers was his most successful, as he formed an effective strike partnership with Les Allen, whilst Roger Morgan and Mark Lazarus delivered reliable service from the wings.[17] Marsh scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 4\u20130 win over Middlesbrough.[18] He scored 44 goals in 53 games as the club became Third Division champions; his 30 league goals made him the division's top-scorer. QPR also won the League Cup, with Marsh setting Rangers on their way with four goals during a 5\u20130 victory over Colchester United at Layer Road.[18] They needed a replay to overcome Aldershot, before they beat Swansea Town, top-flight Leicester City, Carlisle United and Birmingham City. Their opponents in the Wembley final were West Bromwich Albion, who had won the cup the previous year. The \"Baggies\" took a two-goal lead before half-time, but Rangers fought back in the second half and on the 75th minute Marsh scored what he described as \"the defining goal of my career\" when he made a mazy run past numerous defenders before finding the net with a 25-yard shot that went in off the post.[11][19] Lazarus scored QPR's third goal six minutes later to win the game 3\u20132.[20] A week after the final Tottenham Hotspur manager witnessed Marsh put in a strong performance against Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic and he offered to pay QPR \u00a3180,000 for Marsh and Morgan, but his offer was rejected by chairman Jim Gregory.[17]\n\nThe 1967\u201368 season saw a second successive promotion as QPR reached the First Division as runners-up in the Second Division, ahead of Blackpool on goal average. Marsh was again top-scorer with 14 goals despite missing the start of the season with a broken foot.[11] He signed a new four-year contract in the summer.[11]\n\nRangers were unable to compete in the top-flight, and Marsh himself struggled with injury as the club suffered relegation with only 18 points to their name.[16] He broke his foot in pre-season training for the 1968\u201369 campaign and missed the opening months; during this time the club struggled as Stock resigned before the season started, and he was replaced by Bill Dodgin in a caretaker capacity.[21] By the time Marsh recovered from his injury manager Tommy Docherty's first 28-day spell in charge at Loftus Road had come and gone.[22]\n\nIn summer 1969, Marsh was sent off in a friendly against Rangers after punching Kai Johansen in retaliation for a kick Johansen gave Marsh.[23] In the 1969\u201370 season he and Barry Bridges shared 46 goals equally between them, as QPR finished in ninth position. They also reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, which was then the club's joint-best achievement in the competition.\n\nMarsh again hit 23 goals in the 1970\u201371 campaign, as Rangers again finished in mid-table obscurity under the stewardship of Gordon Jago. However Marsh lost his captaincy to new signing Terry Venables.[24]\n\nHe hit 20 goals in the 1971\u201372 season to finish as the club's top-scorer for the second successive season. Before the season began he signed a new contract on the understanding that he would leave the club if they could not achieve promotion by the end of the season.[24] QPR were still in the hunt for promotion by the time that Marsh was sold \u2013 they eventually finished a few points short, however the sum offered by Manchester City was too much for the club to refuse.[25]\n\nIn March 1972, he was signed for Manchester City by Malcolm Allison for a then-club record \u00a3200,000.[25] City were four points clear at the top of the table when Marsh was signed, but by the end of the season they had slipped to fourth.[16] Many pundits criticised the signing, pointing out that Marsh was a maverick player ill-suited to Allison's well-drilled set-up.[16] He initially replaced Wyn Davies up front in a 4-4-2 formation, before playing alongside Davies, Mike Summerbee and Francis Lee in a 4-2-4 set-up.[26]\n\nRight, no beating about the bush, I have to hold my hands up \u2013 I cost Manchester City the 1972 league championship.\nMarsh became City's top-scorer, scoring 19 goals in 1972\u201373. However the club entered into a decline when Allison resigned in March 1973; over the next year Johnny Hart, Tony Book and Ron Saunders all had spells as City manager. The \"Sky Blues\" finished 11th in 1972\u201373 and 14th in 1973\u201374. They did though reach the final of the League Cup in 1974, losing 2\u20131 to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Wembley. Marsh was so disappointed by the defeat he threw away his runners-up medal.[28]\n\nTony Book started his second spell as City's manager in April 1974, and despite being club captain Marsh showed no respect for Book.[29] City finished eighth in 1974\u201375 and 1975\u201376. Marsh was transfer-listed and sent to train with the reserves after chairman Peter Swales told Book the details of a private conversation the pair had held:[30]\n\nIf you think I'm effing useless it's not going to work. Do you want to take it back? (Book)\nNo chance. In fact, thinking about it more, you're not that good. (Marsh)\nIn the middle of 1975 Marsh played a handful of matches for Cork Hibernians for a fee of \u00a3600 a game.[31] He later was flown to Los Angeles as a guest of Elton John, who was then chairman of the Los Angeles Aztecs in the NASL, but before he agreed to join the club he was approached in January 1976 by the Tampa Bay Rowdies.[32] He was sold to the Rowdies in April 1976 for a \u00a340,000 fee.[11] He made two oft-quoted remarks during his transfer, stating that \"football in England had become a grey game, played on grey days by grey people\" and upon arriving in America he announced that \"Pel\u00e9 is known as the black Rodney Marsh\" after the Rowdies owner said that \"Rodney Marsh is known as the white Pel\u00e9\".[33]\n\nHe played from 1976 to 1979 in the States, leading the Rowdies to the Soccer Bowl in his final two seasons. Both times they would come up short. Marsh was a NASL All-Star every year, making the first-team in 1976 and 1978, the second team in 1977 and as an Honorable Mention in his final season. Despite this success he suffered from depression and was drinking heavily for much of his time there.[34] Head coach Eddie Firmani resigned from the club in 1977 after becoming frustrated with Marsh's ill-discipline; he was replaced by John Boyle.[35] Marsh stopped his drinking after his doctor told him that alcohol was destroying his liver and seriously shortening his life expectancy.[36] Marsh left the club after being forced out in 1979.[37] He went off in another tantrum after being substituted with ten minutes to go of his competitive career by head coach Gordon Jago.[38] While serving as Rowdies manager for the 1986\u201387 AISA season, the long-retired Marsh was pressed into service once again as a player, due to a rash of injuries on the squad.[39][40]\n\nHe spent the winter of the 1976\u201377 season on loan at Fulham, now in the Second Division, after learning that George Best would also be playing at Craven Cottage.[41] The \"Cottagers\" were then a fashionable club where celebrities would often be in attendance and players like Marsh and Best would spend much of their free time in London nightclubs; manager Alec Stock ensured that the partying off the pitch did not hamper progress on the pitch.[42] Stock resigned and new boss Bobby Campbell took the club as high as fourth place before a run of nine defeats in 12 games saw Fulham slide down the table.[43] The bleak wintery conditions eventually took their toll on Best and Marsh, who both returned to the US early in 1976.[44]\n\nMarsh made his England debut in a 1\u20131 draw with Switzerland at Wembley in November 1971, coming on as a substitute for Francis Lee.[25] He won a total of nine caps, scoring one goal, which came in a 3\u20130 victory over Wales.\n\nIt has been reported that the England manager Alf Ramsey told him \"I'll be watching you for the first 45 minutes and if you don't work harder I'll pull you off at half time,\" to which Marsh replied: \"Crikey, Alf, at QPR all we get is an orange and a cup of tea.\"[45]\n\nOften cited as a player who did not make the most of his talents, Marsh was a strong striker with great technical ability.[16] An excellent dribbler of the ball,[11] he was capable of producing moments of rare skill and extravagant attempts on goal, which earned him a reputation as a show-boater.[16] His ability and the rarity which he played to his full potential earned him comparisons to George Best.[45] He would regularly retaliate against players who used foul play to stop his runs, and picked up numerous fines from the FA for fighting back against his aggressors.[11]\n\nI would feel more elation if we lost 4\u20133 in a match which really touched the heights than us sneaking through 1\u20130 in one of those grey matches. If we cannot remind people what a great game it is then we will have missed a tremendous opportunity.\"\nHe retired after 1979, and coached New York United in the ASL.[46] He resigned three months into his contract when the general manager insisted that he sign five Uruguayan refugees to the club against his wishes.[47] In 1981, he was appointed head coach and CEO of the newly created Carolina Lightnin', and quickly assembled a team around star midfielder Don Tobin.[48] He coached the team to the Freedom Conference title in 1981, and they went on to beat his former club New York United 2\u20131 in the championship final.[49] In 1982 they lost at the semi-final stage to the Oklahoma City Slickers.[50] He then hired Bobby Moore as a coach.[51] At the end of a disappointing 1983 campaign the league folded and Marsh returned to the Tampa Bay Rowdies as head coach in October 1983.[52] There he gave Roy Wegerle his debut as a professional player.[53] After the 1984 season the North American Soccer League also disbanded.[52] The club remained however, and later joined the National Professional Soccer League. Marsh relinquished his coaching duties and remained on as CEO, and appointed Mark Lawrenson and later Malcolm Allison, Ricky Hill, David Hay and Ken Fogarty as head coaches.[54]\n\nAfter ending his coaching career, Marsh undertook a three-year roadshow tour with George Best.[55] He began his career in the media with Best, presenting football related videos, before he became a regular feature on television.[56] In 1994, he spent a brief period as CEO of Queens Park Rangers.[57]\n\nMarsh worked as a pundit for Sky Sports for many years. Whilst there he was involved in long-running banter with Bradford City and its supporters in the 1999\u20132000 season, in which he flippantly dismissed their chances of survival in the Premier League.[58] He offered to shave all of his hair off if the club stayed up, and honoured his bet and had his hair removed in the centre circle of Valley Parade.[58]\n\nHe appeared on Soccer Saturday for a total of 11 years until he was sacked in January 2005.[59] He was fired after he joked about the 2004 Asian tsunami during a live broadcast of You're On Sky Sports.[60] He had said: \"David Beckham has turned down a move to Newcastle United because of trouble with the 'Toon Army in Asia'.\"[59] Whilst Marsh subsequently apologised on air, this was not enough to save his job.[61] Subsequently, Marsh joined Talksport as a presenter, co-hosting the daily Drivetime show with Paul Breen-Turner.[62] In 2006, Talksport received a number of complaints and the programme director issued an apology after Marsh made a newsreader laugh uncontrollably whilst she was reporting the death of a British soldier in Afghanistan.[63] Marsh left the station in October 2006.[64]\n\nSince then Marsh attempted to rebuild his career with appearances on reality television. He appeared in the 2007 series of ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! where he was the fifth person to be voted off the show; Celebrity Come Dine with Me on Channel 4 in January 2009, in which he came in joint second place tied with Abi Titmuss; the first series of Celebrity Coach Trip on Channel 4 in November 2010, where he was partnered with Cheryl Baker; other notable appearances include Sing If You Can and Cash in the Attic. He is currently cohost of Grumpy Pundits on Sirius Radio.\n\nHe married Jean Barry in March 1967.[1] The pair met a few years earlier at a jazz club in Manor Park.[14]\n\nHe and his son Jonathan founded the Marsh Group, a property development company in Tampa, Florida, in 1996.[65] After retiring as a player Marsh continued to support QPR and Manchester City. Today he is now a co-host for a radio show called Grumpy Pundits on Sirius XM.\n\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n\n (N) Football League Third Division North; (S) Football League Third Division South \n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Marsh"}, {"id": 243, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/node_img/536/10706904/original/maciej-szcz-sny-football-players-soccer--photo-1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Maciej Szcz\u0119sny", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/maciej-szcz\u0119sny/10706904", "desc": "Maciej Wawrzyniec Szcz\u0119sny (pronounced [\u02c8mat\u0361\u0255\u025bj \u02c8\u0282t\u0361\u0282\u025b\u0303sn\u0268]) (born 28 June 1965) is a former footballer from Poland, who played for Legia Warsaw, Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Polonia Warsaw and Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w as a goalkeeper.

Scoring over 250 goals in his career, he also became known for his trademark windmill goal celebration.[2] Channon later became a successful racehorse trainer.\n\nChannon was born in Orcheston, Wiltshire and made his debut for Southampton as a 17-year-old in 1966, scoring in a match against Bristol City. Within three years he had established himself as the club's main goalscorer and was consistent in front of goal at a time when Southampton were one of the less fashionable teams in English football's First Division. However, despite a record season tally of 21 goals for Southampton in 1974, the club was relegated to the Second Division at the end of the season.\n\nChannon stayed loyal to Southampton despite obvious concerns for his international chances and was rewarded in 1976 which was a special year for Channon. Southampton were still in the Second Division but nevertheless enjoyed a dream run to the FA Cup final where they played Manchester United. Although Southampton were a lower division side, they were considerably more experienced than Manchester United's youthful team. Southampton won 1\u20130, with Channon playing a part in the winning goal scored late in the game by Bobby Stokes. It was his first domestic honour in the game.\n\nIn the 1977 close season, Channon left Southampton \u2014 still in the Second Division \u2014 to join Manchester City in a \u00a3300,000 deal. His new club were making progress, having just finished second in the First Division behind champions Liverpool, but this was where they peaked and Channon struggled to settle. He scored just 12 goals in his first season and 11 in his second.\n\nChannon went back to Southampton (by now back in the First Division) in September 1979. Now in his thirties, he continued to play regularly though his goals ratio was not good in his second spell, with only ten coming in each of his first two seasons back at the club. He joined Newcastle United in 1982 after playing 510 games for Southampton over two spells, scoring a total of 185 goals placing him top of the club's list of all-time goalscorers.\n\nChannon lasted barely a month at Newcastle before joining Bristol Rovers. His impressive career seemingly on the decline, he failed to score in nine games for Bristol Rovers before a sudden departure again, this time to Norwich City where, at the age of 34, he found some of his old touch. He played 88 games over three seasons, scoring 16 goals, and suffered a mixed end to his Norwich career in 1985 when the club won the League Cup \u2014 Channon's second and final domestic honour \u2014 with a 1\u20130 win over Sunderland at Wembley, but were then relegated (with Sunderland) at the end of the same season. Channon joined Portsmouth and Finn Harps (where he played in one League of Ireland Cup game),[3] before retiring from the game in 1986.\n\nCalled up to make his debut for the England national team by Alf Ramsey in October 1972, Channon played well enough in a 1\u20131 draw with Yugoslavia at Wembley to be selected for the squads for two subsequent qualifying matches for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, although he wasn't eventually in the team for either.[clarification needed] However, he won his second cap in a famous 5\u20130 hammering of Scotland at Hampden Park in February 1973, scoring his first goal in the process.\n\nAs the year progressed, Channon scored again in a match against Wales and then added a brace in a 7\u20130 thumping of Austria before he was picked by Ramsey for his first competitive match - a crucial and ultimately infamous World Cup qualifier against Poland at Wembley. If England didn't win, they wouldn't qualify for the tournament. Channon, in his tenth England outing, was in an attacking line-up which spent pretty much the whole match in the Poland half, trying to break the deadlock. Channon saw his own chances saved by the eccentric but inspired goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski and the game ended 1\u20131.\n\nHe played in a series of post-season friendlies for England, scoring in three of them and was kept in the side the following October as England began their campaign to qualify for the 1976 European Championships. Channon scored in the game against Czechoslovakia as England won 3\u20130. Channon's next goal for England was a while coming \u2014 in September 1975 \u2014 as England beat Switzerland in a friendly. England had two qualifying games left at the end of the year for the 1976 European Championships and Channon scored in both, but England lost 2\u20131 to Czechoslovakia in Bratislava and then only drew 1\u20131 with Portugal in Lisbon. England failed to qualify and Czechoslovakia went on to win the tournament.\n\nAfter winning an FA Cup medal in the 1976 Final, Channon was back at Wembley days later to score twice in England's 4\u20130 win over Northern Ireland; he then scored again four days later against Scotland but England lost 2\u20131 at Hampden Park. There followed a summer tournament in the U.S. for the bi-centennial celebrations, and Channon scored twice in a thrilling game against Italy as England came from two goals down to win 3\u20132. A fortnight later, Channon scored again as England defeated Finland 4\u20131 in Helsinki to get their qualification campaign for the 1978 FIFA World Cup off to a perfect start, though this would be tempered a month later by a defeat against Italy in Rome.\n\nIn March 1977, Channon scored twice as England beat Luxembourg at Wembley to get their World Cup campaign back on track; Luxembourg were the 'whipping boys' of the group and England would later need to demolish Luxembourg by a similar or better scoreline in Luxembourg to give themselves a chance of overhauling Italy and qualifying for the World Cup.\n\nChannon hit his 20th England goal in a 2\u20131 win over Northern Ireland in May 1977. A week later came another Channon goal against Scotland - this time from the penalty spot - but this proved an infamous England defeat as the Scots won 2\u20131 and their fans invaded the Wembley pitch in celebration, ripping up clods of souvenir turf and pulling down one of the crossbars.\n\nAfter an ill-fated move to Manchester City affected his form, Ron Greenwood chose to omit him from the starting line-up when England played the crucial World Cup qualifier in Luxembourg in October 1977. England won 2\u20130 and, despite victory over Italy in the last game of the campaign, the goals record was insufficient to take them to the World Cup. Channon was not selected for his country again; his international career ended with 46 appearances and a healthy 21 goals. England's failure to qualify for three major international tournaments during Channon's career leaves him as the most-capped player never to have been named to a World Cup or European Championships squad. As of 17 July 2018, he remains joint 18th in the all-time England scorers list, level with Kevin Keegan and Steven Gerrard.[4]\n\nChannon always had an interest in horse racing during his football career. After retiring from full-time professional football in 1986, he began working as an assistant trainer, before becoming a licensed trainer in his own right in 1990. He initially had ten horses.\n\nHe then moved to the West Ilsley stables near Newbury, formerly owned by the Queen, and began to increase his number of horses, eventually ending up with almost 200.\n\nIn 2002, he ended the season with 123 winners, topping the 100-mark for the first time in his career. He is one of the sport's most respected trainers, though has yet to produce a winner of one of the British Classic Races. In May 2012, he produced his first Classic winner when Samitar took the Irish 1,000 Guineas.\n\nAmong owners who have had their horses with Channon are old colleagues and acquaintances from his footballing days, including Kevin Keegan, Alan Ball, Chris Cattlin and Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nOn 27 August 2008, Channon was involved and injured in a motorway accident on the M1. He was travelling from the Doncaster Sales to his West Ilsley stables in Berkshire when the accident happened. Channon was reported to have suffered a punctured lung and broken arm and jaw.\n\nDuring an interview with Clare Balding broadcast on BBC One on 3 January 2009, Channon spoke about how, as a result of the broken jaw, he was subsequently fitted with metal plates in his face. Bloodstock agent and friend Tim Corby died in the accident.[5]\n\nHe was the subject of This Is Your Life in 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while being interviewed at his West Ilsley racing stables near Newbury.[citation needed]\n\nSouthampton\n\nNorwich City\n\nGreat Britain\n\nCanada\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Channon"}, {"id": 246, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/89/1767588/original/paul-galvin-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Paul Galvin", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/paul-galvin/1767588", "desc": "Paul Galvin (born 2 November 1979) is an Irish sportsperson.

He plays Gaelic football with his local club Finuge, his divisional side Feale Rangers and for the Kerry county team between 2003 and 2014. Galvin had the honour of being named as the 1000th All Star Award. He also represented Ireland in the 2004 International Rules Series.\n\nGalvin writes a weekly fashion column for the Irish Independent newspaper and presents a show on Radio Kerry.[1][2]\n\nHe has also managed the Wexford footballers.\n\nBorn in Lixnaw, County Kerry, Galvin plays his club football with his local club Finuge and with his divisional side Feale Rangers. He also plays hurling with his local club Lixnaw.\n\nIn 2002 Galvin tasted victory for the first time as a footballer when Finuge qualified for the final of the county junior championship.  The opponents on that occasion were Castlegregory.  After two defeats at the same stage of the competition in 1998 and 2000, Galvin's side made no mistake at the third time of asking.  A merited 0\u201312 to 1\u20136 victory gave Finuge the victory and gave Galvin a county junior winners' medal.[3] Finuge subsequently represented Kerry in the provincial junior championship and even reached the final.  Cork champions Kiskeam provided the opposition, however, the dream season continued for the Kerry men.  Galvin added a Munster junior winners' medal to his collection following a 0\u201314 to 0\u201311 victory.[4]\n\nAfter surrendering their county title for a year, Finuge were back in the county junior final again in 2004. Lispole were the opponents this time around and a close game developed once again.  Galvin's side nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally, however, after a period of extra-time Finuge regained the title on a score line of 1\u201310 to 1\u20137.[5] Another provincial decider beckoned for Galvin's side, with Cork champions Aghabullogue providing the opposition.  The game was an exciting but one-sided affair, and Galvin picked up a second Munster junior winners' medal after a 2\u201313 to 3\u20134 victory.[6] On this occasion the Kerry side went all the way to the All-Ireland final where Stewartstown Harps of Tyrone were waiting.  Galvin gave an outstanding display in that game and the northerners were easily brushed aside on a score line of 1\u201314 to 0\u20136.[7] This win gave Galvin an All-Ireland club winners' medal in the junior grade.\n\nIn 2007 Galvin lined out with divisional side Feale Rangers in the final of the county senior championship.  A divisional side from the other half of the county, South Kerry provided the opposition.  Furthermore, South Kerry were going for a remarkable fourth county title in succession.  The game was an extremely close affair, however, Galvin's side pulled through to win by 1\u20135 to 0\u20136.[8] With that he added a county senior winners' medal to his collection.  It was Rangers' first county triumph in twenty-seven years.\n\nGalvin is also a hurler of note and has enjoyed much success with Lixnaw.  In 1999 he was a key member of the team that lined out against Crotta O'Neill's in the final of the county senior championship.  After a 2\u20138 apiece draw, Lixnaw made no mistake in the replay and secured a narrow 0\u20139 to 1\u20135 victory.  It was his first senior winners' medal in hurling.\n\nAfter back-to-back county final defeats in 2002 and 2003, Lixnaw were back in 2005 and faced Abbeydorney.  A third defeat in four years looked extremely likely, however, Galvin was the hero of the day.  In the second minute of injury-time he sent over the equalising point and secured a 1\u201311 to 2\u20138 draw and a second chance in the replay.[9] Lixnaw made no mistake on the second occasion and blew the opposition off the pitch.  An enormous 0\u201317 to 0\u20136 victory gave Galvin a second county winners' medal.[10]\n\nAfter surrendering the hurling title the following year, Lixnaw were back to reclaim it in 2007.  Kilmoyley provided the opposition in another final as Galvin's side went into the game as underdogs.  The form book was torn up as Lixnaw powered to a 1\u201312 to 2\u20136 victory and a third county winners' medal for Galvin.\n\nOn 21 January 2011, media reports suggested that Galvin was poised for a club transfer from Finuge to St Vincent's in Dublin, but his club team-mate and former member of the Kerry management team, \u00c9amonn Fitzmaurice, rubbished those reports via Twitter.[11]\n\nGalvin first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Kerry minor football team in the late 1990s.  He lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in 1997 with Limerick providing the opposition.  The game was a huge triumph for 'the Kingdom' as Galvin's side won by 4\u201312 to 1\u20137.  It was his first Munster winners' medal at minor level.[12] Kerry were later defeated in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final. The same year he won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team following victory over Tyrone in the final.\n\nGalvin's performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the Kerry under-21 team in 1999.  The provincial decider that year pitted Kerry against archrivals Cork.  A close game developed, however, after the sixty minutes Kerry were the champions by 1\u201310 to 0\u20137.  It was Galvin's only Munster under-21 winners' medal.[13] An All-Ireland final appearance followed for Galvin, with Westmeath providing the opposition.  Kerry were the favourites going into the game, however, the Leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers.  A narrow 0\u201312 to 0\u20139 score line resulted in defeat for Galvin's side.\n\nGalvin continued to play for the Kerry under-21 team for another two seasons, however, he enjoyed little further success.\n\nGalvin first played at intercounty senior level for Kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late 90s. He made a number of appearances with the team during the NHL during this time.\n\nGalvin joined the Kerry senior football team in the early 2000s, however, he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen.  In 2003 he renewed his rivalry with Limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider. A 1\u201311 to 0\u20139 victory gave Galvin a first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade.[14] After an exciting game with Roscommon, Kerry advanced to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Tyrone.  After being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships, Kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match.  The whole team struggled and Kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new \"blanket defence\" that was introduced by teams like Armagh and perfected by Tyrone.  Many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like \u00d3 S\u00e9 and Colm Cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness.  A humiliating 0\u201313 to 0\u20136 defeat saw Tyrone advance to the All-Ireland final while Kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship.[15]\n\n2004 saw Galvin become an integral part of the Kerry team.  The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League.  An exciting 3\u201311 to 1\u20136 victory saw Kerry claim the title and Galvin picked up a first National Football League winners' medal.[16] Kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and, for the second year in succession, Limerick were the opponents.  Surprisingly, that game ended in a 1\u201310 apiece draw.[17] The replay was also a close-run affair; however, Kerry never really looked in danger of losing.  A 3\u201310 to 2\u20139 victory gave Galvin a second Munster winners' medal.[18] The All-Ireland series proved no difficulty for Kerry, and 'the Kingdom' booked their place in the All-Ireland final against Mayo.  An early goal from Alan Dillon gave the Connacht men some hope, however, the game was effectively over after twenty-five minutes when Colm Cooper scored Kerry's only goal of the day.  The points kept coming from Galvin's team and an injury-time Michael Conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for Mayo.  A 1\u201320 to 2\u20139 victory gave Galvin an All-Ireland winners' medal.[19] Galvin was later presented with his first All-Star, the 1000th award since the scheme began in 1971.[20]\n\nIn 2005 Kerry were hot favourites to retain their All-Ireland title.  All was going to plan as Galvin's side reached yet another provincial final.  In a return to tradition, Cork were the opponents.  A close game developed, however, in the end Kerry were the narrow winners by 1\u201311 to 0\u201311.[21] It was Galvin's third consecutive Munster winners' medal.  Following this win Kerry cruised through the All-Ireland series to reach another championship decider with Tyrone providing the opposition.  In one of the great finals of the decade, the result remained in doubt until the final whistle.  Dara \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide powered Kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes.  Tyrone responded in kind with a Peter Canavan goal just before half-time.  Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 S\u00e9 launched the Kerry comeback in the 57th minute with Kerry's second goal; however, it was too later.  Tyrone hung on to win by 1\u201316 to 2\u201310.  It was Galvin's first defeat in an All-Ireland final.[22]\n\nIn 2006 Kerry reached the final of the National League and played Galway.  Galvin's side could only manage three points in the opening half, however, the introduction of Eoin Brosnan transformed the team.  At the end of the seventy minutes a 2\u201312 to 0\u201310 score line gave Kerry their 18th National League title and a second for Galvin.[23] The league win was a false dawn as Kerry went out tamely to Cork in a replay of the Munster final. The team, however, bounced back against Longford to set up a meeting with Armagh in the All-Ireland quarter-final.  At half-time it looked as though the Ulser hoodoo would strike again but Kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of 3\u201315 to 1\u201313.  The game was not without incident as Galvin was red-carded for an altercation with the Armagh water carrier.[24] Kerry again beat Cork in the subsequent semi-final before lining out against Mayo in the All-Ireland final.  An unbelievable opening first-half saw Kerry go 2\u20134 to no score ahead after just ten minutes, courtesy of goals by Declan O'Sullivan and Kieran Donaghy. Colm Cooper slotted a third Kerry goal, however, Mayo settled and reduced the deficit to 3\u20138 to 3\u20132 at half-time.  The second thirty-five minutes saw Kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points.  A final score of 4\u201315 to 3\u20135 gave Kerry another All-Ireland title and gave Galvin a second All-Ireland winners' medal.[25] Galvin finished off the year with a second All-Star award.\n\n2007 saw Kerry face Cork in the provincial decider once again.  A close game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Kerry were the champions by 1\u201315 to 1\u201313.[26] It was \u00d3 Galvin's fourth Munster winners' medal.  Kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their All-Ireland quarter-final against Monaghan, setting up a glamour All-Ireland semi-final tie with Dublin. Kerry saw off a great Dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points.  The subsequent All-Ireland final was an historic occasion as Kerry faced Cork in the very first all-Munster championship decider.  While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued.  Cork goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals.  At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3\u201313 to 1\u20139.[27] It was a third All-Ireland medal for Galvin and the first completion of back-to-back All-Ireland titles since Cork in 1989 and 1990.\n\nIn 2008 Galvin was appointed captain of the Kerry team.  It was a great honour.  What should have been a dream season for the Finuge man, particularly since Kerry were attempting to capture a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1986, 'the Kingdom's' championship opener against Clare was a dark moment for Galvin.  The game was a largely low-key affair except for one controversial incident between referee Paddy Russell and Galvin.  Russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of Russell's hand.  Galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card.  The incident has been described as due to the \"frustration\" he felt at being booked \"for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his Clare marker\".[28] Galvin received a six-month suspension, however, this was later reduced to twelve weeks.  It looked at this stage that Galvin's dream season was in tatters.  Kerry drove on without him and reached the All-Ireland final for a fifth successive year.  Conveniently, Galvin's suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against Tyrone.  While he did not start the game he came on as a substitute.  An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years.  The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0\u20138 to 0\u20137 ahead before the interval.  Tyrone simply wore Kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from Tommy McGuigan and a string of late points inspired Tyrone to their third All-Ireland title of the decade.[29]\n\n2009 saw Galvin return to the half-forward line for Kerry's opening Munster semi-final meeting with Cork.  That game ended in a draw, however, Kerry were well beaten in the replay.  'The Kingdom' were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over Longford, Sligo and Antrim.  Galvin and his squad later lined out in the All-Ireland quarter-final and thrashed Dublin before overcoming Meath in a disappointing semi-final. For the second year in-a-row Kerry faced Cork in the All-Ireland final.  Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs.  This tag appeared to be justified when Galvin's side trailed by 1\u20133 to 0\u20131 early in the opening half.  The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan while Cork recorded fourteen wides, and at the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0\u201316 to 1\u20139.[30] It was Galvin's fourth All-Ireland medal.  He subsequently won an All-Star and the Footballer of the Year award.\n\nIn June 2010, Galvin was given an eight-week ban after the 2010 Munster Senior Football Championship semi-final replay win over Cork.[31]\nThe GAA's Central Competitions Control Committee proposed the suspension after reviewing video evidence of Galvin putting his finger into Eoin Cadogan's mouth.[32]\n\nOn 1 February 2014, Galvin unexpectedly announced his retirement from inter county football in the aftermath of Kerry's opening round game of the 2014 National Football League.[33]\nKerry had lost by one point to Dublin in a game in which Galvin had not been involved.[34][35][36][37]\n\nOn 3 March 2015, Galvin returned to the Kerry senior football panel.[38]\n\nGalvin played with UCC with whom he won Cork Senior Football Championship and Munster Senior Club Football Championship medals in 1999. He also played in the Sigerson Cup.\n\nGalvin represented Ireland in the International Rules Series in 2004.\n\nGalvin has played for Munster in the Railway Cup.\n\nGalvin won an All-Ireland Vocational Schools Championship with the Kerry Vocational Schools team in 1997.\n\nGalvin has in the past trained with Cork City of Munster and Sunderland of Tyne and Wear.\n\nOn 2 August 2019, Wexford GAA announced Galvin as its senior football manager on a two-year term, succeeding Paul McLoughlin.\n\nGalvin was a secondary school teacher of Geography and Gaeilge in Col\u00e1iste Chr\u00edost R\u00ed, Cork and St. Brendan's College, Killarney. He coached the senior school team to the All-Ireland in 2009.[39]\n\nIn February 2012, he came third in a poll to find Ireland's most desirable Valentines.[40]\n\nIn April 2013 it was reported he had been sued for \u20ac8,000 in damages for throwing a blackboard duster at one of his students.[41]\n\nPaul Galvin got engaged to Louise Duffy on a trip to New York in March 2014.[42] They got married on New Year's Eve 2015.[43]\n\nIn October 2011, Galvin allegedly assaulted the impressionist Oliver Callan and his producer James McDonald[44][45] late at night in Kehoe's Pub, Central Dublin. Among witnesses to the alleged incident were a Government Minister, a TD, a senator and several journalists. One witness alleged Galvin called Callan a \"Fucking Cunt\".[46] The incident was investigated by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.[1] The media speculated on the reason behind the alleged incident, reporting that Callan had recently mimicked Galvin asking Taoiseach Enda Kenny to man-up by giving him a body-wax on Green Tea[47] and that Galvin had texted Callan before an appearance on The Saturday Night Show in relation to \"gay jibes\" the satirist had directed at him.[48] It was eventually revealed that Galvin had complained (or not complained at all)[49] to RT\u00c9 after what he described as \"the most excruciating night of my life\" at home on his sofa between his parents in Kerry watching The Saturday Night Show when Callan referred to Galvin's \"years spent in the closet\".[50]\n\nOn 6 December 2011, Galvin spoke of the encounter during an interview on The Ray D'Arcy Show on Today FM.[51][52]\n\n**=Interim manager\n\nUnder-20s incl.

He left United for a trial with Yeovil Town in 2005 after the club decided to abandon one of their reserve sides.[2][3] Right-sided midfielder Poole impressed manager Gary Johnson during his month at Huish Park and he was signed by Yeovil on a free transfer in June 2005.[3] He made his debut for the club on 6 August 2005 in a 2\u20130 defeat to Oldham Athletic.[4] On 17 December 2005, he scored his first goal for the club, getting his name on the score-sheet in a 2\u20131 win over Barnsley.[5] He scored again later that month, in a 1\u20131 draw with Bristol City.[6] He finished the 2005\u201306 season with just the two goals to his name in 25 appearances.[7]\n\nAfter playing just four games for Yeovil in the 2006\u201307 season,[8] he was sent out on loan to Football League Two side Stockport County for two-months in August 2006.[9] After scoring one goal against Barnet in five first-team appearances for Stockport, his loan was extended for an additional month.[9]\n\nAfter returning to Yeovil for a short while, both clubs & the player agreed a deal that saw Poole return to Edgeley Park for a \u00a310,000 fee.[10] He scored his first goal since signing on a permanent deal in an FA Cup third round tie at Premier League side Watford in January 2007.[11] Poole finished the 2006\u201307 season with three goals for Stockport since signing permanently,[8] the latter two coming as part of a 5\u20130 win over Darlington on the final day of the season.[12] He grabbed his first goal of the 2007\u201308 season in November, scoring in a 1\u20131 draw at Bradford City.[13] He scored his second of the campaign in March 2008, scoring the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over Lincoln City.[14] He finished the season with just the two goals in 25 first team appearances.[15]\n\nOn 1 July 2008, he joined Darlington on a free transfer after being released by Stockport.[16] He made his debut on 9 August 2008, in a 1\u20131 draw with Exeter City at the Darlington Arena.[17] It took Poole until March 2009 to score his first goal for the club, when he scored in a 2\u20131 defeat to Macclesfield Town.[18] He finished the 2008\u201309 season having played a total of 30 games in all competitions, scoring just the one goal.[19]\n\nIn July 2009, he returned to Stockport County after being released by Darlington.[20] He made his second debut for the club on 8 August 2009 in a 0\u20130 draw with Oldham Athletic.[21] He scored his first goal of the season in November, in a 5\u20130 FA Cup win over Tooting & Mitcham United.[22] He received a red card in December in a 4\u20132 defeat to Leeds United.[23] He received his second red card of the season in March 2010 in a 1\u20130 defeat to Bristol Rovers.[23] He finished the 2009\u201310 season with just the one goal.[23] He scored his first goal of the 2010\u201311 season in December 2010, scoring in a 3\u20133 draw with Crewe Alexandra.[24] He scored just once more that season, scoring in a 4\u20133 defeat to Lincoln City in January 2011.[25] He finished the season with just the two goals in 32 appearances,[26] and in May 2011 he was informed that he would not be offered a contract by the club for the 2011\u201312 season.[27]\n\nOn 18 August 2011, he signed for Conference North side Droylsden,[28] but in November 2011 he joined their local and league rivals Hyde.[29] He made his debut for the club coming on as a substitute for Shelton Payne in a 1\u20130 win over Blyth Spartans.[30] He scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20132 draw at Worcester City in December 2011.[31] After helping Hyde to win the Conference North title, he signed a new contract with the club which would keep him there until the end of the 2012\u201313 season.[32] This was followed by another one-year deal in the summer of 2013.[33]\n\nPoole married Carolynne Good on 3 June 2008.[34] They divorced in 2011.\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Poole_(footballer)"}, {"id": 248, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Wayne Carey", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/wayne-carey/2365367", "desc": "Wayne Francis Carey (born 27 May 1971) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the North Melbourne Football Club and the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).\nA dual-premiership captain at North Melbourne, four-time North Melbourne best-and-fairest (Syd Barker Medallist) and seven-time All-Australian, Carey, is nicknamed \"The King\", or \"Duck\". In 2001, he was named as centre half-forward and captain of North Melbourne's Team of the Century, and in 2008", "full_desc": "\n\nClub\n\nRepresentative\n\nWayne Francis Carey[2] (born 27 May 1971) is a  former Australian rules footballer who played with the North Melbourne Football Club and Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).\n\nA dual-premiership captain at North Melbourne (1996 and 1999), four-time North Melbourne best-and-fairest (Syd Barker Medallist) and seven-time All-Australian, Carey is nicknamed \"The King\", or \"Duck\". In 2001, he was named as centre half-forward and captain of North Melbourne's Team of the Century, and in 2008 was named as Australian football's greatest ever player, as part of a list of the top 50 players of all time, published in the book The Australian Game of Football, which was released by the League to celebrate 150 years of Australian rules football.[3]\n\nIn 2002, he left North Melbourne in disgrace after it was revealed he'd been having an extramarital affair with the wife of his then-teammate Anthony Stevens. He is also known for a string of legal problems, which include domestic violence charges and assault convictions.\n\nFrom 2014, Carey has worked as a Friday night football commentator and Talking Footy panelist with Channel Seven. He has also written as a columnist for The Age[4] and is a regular fixture on Triple M's The Rush Hour segment called \"The Midweek Rub\", which has since been spun off as its own podcast.[5][6] He had previously worked for 3AW and Channel 9 before being fired for a glassing incident in Miami.[7]\n\nThe son of Kevin and Lynne,[8] Carey was one of five children who grew up in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales.[9] His mother and father separated when Carey was aged six, with his mother taking four[10] of the children to Adelaide, living in a homeless shelter.[8] According to Carey's autobiography, his father was a violent man who had spent time at Mannus Correctional Centre and was troubled by alcoholism.[8][10][11] A few months later, Kevin Carey retrieved the children from his estranged wife, and they returned to Wagga Wagga.[10]\n\nCarey played rugby league as a junior,[10] and began playing Australian rules football at the age of eight. At the age of thirteen, Carey returned to Adelaide,[11] where he attended The Heights School[12] and played junior football for North Adelaide.[9]\n\nIn 1987, Carey was recruited by North Melbourne after their CEO, Greg Miller, met with the Sydney Swans' football department to discuss the transfer to North Melbourne of John Longmire, a highly regarded junior key-position player. Once that deal was concluded, Miller then inquired about Carey who, like Longmire, was zoned to the Swans due to having lived in New South Wales. He made a token offer of $10,000 as a transfer fee, to which the Swans surprisingly agreed.[13][14] As a 16-year-old, Carey made the move to Melbourne and played for the North Melbourne under-19s, where he starred in their 1988 premiership side under coach Denis Pagan.[15] Carey was promoted to the senior list prior to the 1989 season and, after recovering from dislocating his left shoulder in a practice match early in the year, made his first appearance for the seniors as an 18-year-old in round 11 of 1989 against Fitzroy.\n\nCarey had a relatively short but successful State of Origin career, and what he describes as a significant period in his career.[16] Carey first played at the game's highest level in 1990 for New South Wales, in a famous win over Victoria, in the side's only 3rd-ever win against the state; Carey scored one goal. In 1992, playing for South Australia against Victoria, Carey played an outstanding game, dominating at centre half-forward and kicking two goals,[17] including the match-winner from 55 metres out in the dying moments. Carey had four opponents in the game, dominating them all, including Chris Langford, Danny Frawley and Garry Lyon.[18] Carey has described this game as the moment he knew he belonged in the AFL.[16] Saying if he could do well at State of Origin level, a higher level than the AFL, he knew he belonged at AFL level.[16] Carey played for NSW/ACT the following year in the State of Origin Carnival scoring one goal. In the latter half of the 1990s, clubs began putting pressure on players to pull out of games due to fear of injury, and players began to stop participating, with the final State of Origin game occurring in 1999.\n\n1989\u20132001\n\nThe 1990s was a decade dominated by forwards, and Wayne Carey dominated his role at centre half-forward more than perhaps any other player in his position before or since.\n\n\n\"Carey had established a reputation as one of perhaps the dozen greatest players of all time,\" according to writer John Devaney of australianfootball.com.[19]\n\"It was clear right from the outset that the Kangaroos had managed to get their hands on someone special. Powerfully built even then, Carey could mark strongly even under the most extreme pressure, and his kicking either to position or at goal was impeccable. He was also surprisingly quick, both over the ground, and in terms of his decision making and use of the ball. Carey won the first of his four North Melbourne best and fairest awards in 1992, and the following year was appointed captain.\n\n\"North's emergence as one of the power clubs of the AFL during the mid- to late 1990s was attributable in no small measure to Carey's presence and contribution. It is arguable that no footballer in history has ever been capable of winning a game entirely off his own boot, but Carey at his peak perhaps came as close as anyone. On a purely objective measure, he was probably worth at least three players\u2014which, coincidentally, is sometimes the number of opponents he had to contend with. Named an AFL All-Australian in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000, Carey was selected as captain of the side on four occasions. In both 1996 and 1999 he was a pivotal member of his club's two most recent premiership sides.\"\n\n\n\u2014John Devaney\nIn March 2002, Carey had an extramarital affair with North Melbourne stalwart and Vice Captain Anthony Stevens' wife, Kelli. Making the situation even messier was the fact that Carey was himself married to his long-term partner Sally McMahon. Carey and Stevens were attending a party at teammate Glenn Archer's house. Carey is quoted as saying Kelli followed him into the toilets in front of a large crowd, including her husband.[20] An argument ensued between Carey and Stevens,[21] and both players subsequently failed to attend football training. In the face of his team being united against him, as well as nationwide condemnation, Carey resigned in disgrace from North Melbourne.[22] Carey's then manager Ricky Nixon famously stated that his client was on \"suicide watch\" during the aftermath.[23] To avoid media attention, Carey fled to Las Vegas, USA.[22] Stevens had played groomsman to Carey at his wedding to Sally.\n\nNorth Melbourne champion and AFL Hall of Famer Brent Harvey said it set the club back \"four or five years\".[24] The aftermath of the affair resulted in Carey missing the 2002 AFL season and transferring to the Adelaide Crows for the 2003 AFL season; he would play two seasons with the Crows, including kicking 56 goals, retiring at the end of the 2004 AFL season. The first game played between North Melbourne and Adelaide in 2003 made for gripping viewing, with Archer and Stevens both taunting and making aggressive moves towards Carey. Although tension was at fever pitch, all players involved managed to restrain themselves from doing anything rash. Adelaide went on to win convincingly by 54 points.[25][26] In a twist of fate, Stevens took over Carey's role of captain in 2004.\n\nIn February 2022, 20 years after the initial fallout from the affair, Carey labelled his affair with Stevens \u201cthe biggest regret of my life as an adult\u201d while participating on season three of the reality TV show SAS Australia.[27] Despite withdrawing from the show, Carey was reportedly paid A$250,000 for the appearance.[28]\n\nIn August 2022, Carey and Stevens met again at a function to celebrate the 26th anniversary of their 1996 premiership (which was initially supposed to be a 25th anniversary but was delayed by a year due to COVID-19); Carey engaged Stevens in a \"verbal stoush\" at the function, although the situation was reportedly de-escalated. The Herald Sun reported there was no potential of violence and that the pair \u201cmoved on and shared a beer together\u201d afterwards.[27]\n\nDespite both players' marriages being rocked by the public scandal, it took each marriage several years to dissolve. Carey's marriage ended in 2006, four years after the incident,[29] while Kelli and Anthony Stevens divorced in 2008, six years after the affair.[30]\n\nCarey was inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame in 2010. Although he was eligible for induction in 2008, his off-field troubles with drugs and violence delayed his induction.[31]\n\nDue to restrictions in the salary cap, North Melbourne was capped at $300,000 per year for Carey for the 2000 AFL season. However, the North Melbourne staff knew that Carey was far more valuable to the team than this, so Carey's manager Ricky Nixon rorted the salary cup to secure Carey an additional $400,000 in salary.[32]\n\nNixon said, \u201cSo I requested Wayne\u2019s intellectual property, and it was owned by Wayne Carey Pty Ltd, and he licensed it to me for $2 so I could sell it to North Melbourne for marketing rights of $700,000,\" Nixon said on the Real Footy podcast.[33]\n\n\u201cHe was getting paid $300,000 from North Melbourne and $700,000 went to me, and I gave Wayne $400,000. People said it was cheating, but it was absolutely within the rules.\n\nAccording to Nixon, when the AFL complained about this manoeuvre, he simply told them \"I run the competition, not you.\"[34]\n\nCarey has been named by many media commentators as the greatest footballer to play the game.[3][35][36] In 1999,[citation needed] Leigh Matthews, who was voted the greatest player of the 20th century, honoured Carey by saying that he was the best player he had ever seen.[37] In 2008, Carey was named as Australian Football's greatest ever player as part of a list of the top 50 players of all time, published in the book The Australian Game of Football,[3] and he placed third in a similar list put together by a panel of football legends in The Age newspaper the same year.[35] In 2011, the Herald Sun polled 21 past and present AFL greats, including Carey, to find the players' opinion as to the greatest player of the AFL era. Carey topped the list, polling 85 of a possible 100 votes, 26 votes ahead of second-placed Gary Ablett Sr.[36]\n\n\"Sure Got Me\" on Paul Kelly's 2004 double album Ways & Means recounts the love triangle involving Carey, Anthony Stevens, and Stevens' wife at the time, Kelli.[38] Hunters & Collectors frontman Mark Seymour also wrote a song inspired by the affair, but he declined to release it after learning of Kelli's take on the events.[38] Jock Cheese, bassist of the satirical Melbourne band TISM, released a tribute to Carey titled \"Why Don't You Get A Bigger Set of Tits?\" on his 2002 solo album Platter.[39]\n\nAs of 2022, Carey's career total of 727 goals ranks him equal 19th in VFL/AFL history,[40] and his 671 goals for North Melbourne is the club record.[41]\n\nIn early 2005, Carey agreed to assist former coach and mentor Denis Pagan at the Carlton Football Club, acting voluntarily as a part-time skills coach. In 2006 he was an assistant coach at Collingwood Football Club. Carey also worked as a commentator and host of shows on the Fox Footy Channel throughout the 2006 season. In 2007 he participated in the Nine Network football analysis program Footy Classified, as well as special comments for radio station 3AW's football coverage. Subsequent to his dual arrests for domestic violence and assault he was sacked from both positions.[43]\n\nIn 2009, Carey was approached in a confidential meeting with influential North Melbourne board member Ron Joseph to return to the club as coach in a succession plan which also involved Malcolm Blight. Carey confirmed this when queried by noted football journalist Damian Barrett in May 2021.[44]\n\nCarey has had a string of scandals besides the aforementioned extramarital affair with Anthony Stevens' wife.\n\nIn 1997, Carey pleaded guilty to indecent assault after grabbing a passing woman's breast on a Melbourne city street after 12 hours of drinking with teammates.[45] He allegedly told her \"Why don't you get a bigger pair of tits\".[46] Carey later settled out of court when the woman filed a civil suit against him.[47]\n\nIn 2000, Carey provided character evidence for Jason Moran, an infamous gangster who was subsequently murdered in Melbourne's gang war.[48]\n\nIn 2004, while holidaying with his then wife, Carey was subject to arrest for a misdemeanour battery report while holidaying in Las Vegas.[22] He was placed in custody for one night then released. The local District Attorney elected not to pursue the case.[22]\n\nCarey again became the subject of public comment in February 2006 when he announced he was leaving his pregnant wife Sally for model Kate Neilson.[49] His daughter Ella was born six weeks later. In December 2006, Neilson allegedly reported Carey to Australian police for domestic violence, alleging he had punched her in the face.[50] Neilson and Carey denied this report. Subsequently, US security guard Kyle Banks told the Nine Network's A Current Affair he saw Carey attacking Neilson while working at the exclusive W Hotel in New York City in October 2006. Banks said he saw Carey break a bottle of French champagne over his own head.[51]\n\nOn 27 January 2008, Carey was arrested after reports of a disturbance at his Port Melbourne apartment. Police had to subdue Carey with capsicum spray and he was seen handcuffed after allegedly assaulting the officers.[52]\n\nTwo days later, the Nine Network announced it would not renew Carey's television contract after it was revealed that Carey had been arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer and Neilson in Miami, Florida, on 27 October 2007, after he allegedly glassed Neilsen in the face and neck with a wine glass.[53][54][55] Police Lieutenant Bill Schwartz, however, reported:[7]\n\nWhen officers went and spoke to him, he immediately was belligerent, starting striking out at the officers, in fact, kicked one of the female officers in the face with his foot, elbowed another one in the side of the face. They had to wrestle him down and handcuff him. When he was in the police car, he used his head as a battering ram and tried to smash a hole between the front compartment of the police car and the prisoner compartment.\nTo stop Carey harming himself and damaging the car, the officers put him into a leather hobble restraint around his hands and legs.[7] Carey faced up to fifteen years in jail and US$30,000 fines. Additionally, Carey was fired from commentary jobs at 3AW and the Nine Network following the coverage of the two arrests.[43] Ultimately Carey pleaded guilty to assaulting and resisting Miami police. In exchange for his guilty pleas, prosecutors agreed that Carey should only serve 50 hours of community service, attend alcohol- and anger-management classes, serve two years probation, and pay US$500 to a Miami police charity.[56] As a consequence of his criminal record in the United States, Carey was refused an entry visa in October 2009.[57]\n\nIn March 2008, Carey publicly revealed he was, for a long period, an abuser of alcohol and cocaine.[58] He was interviewed by Andrew Denton on Enough Rope, where he talked candidly about his life and recent controversies.[8][49] 1.5\u00a0million viewers tuned into the highly publicised interview.[59]\n\nCarey was attempting to visit Barwon Prison in February 2012 to speak to indigenous inmates as part of a mentoring program, however he was found to have traces of cocaine on his clothing following a routine drug scan. Carey was informed that he could enter the prison if he submitted to a strip search. He declined and left the correctional facility.[60]\n\nOn 1 September 2022, according to numerous sources, including The Herald Sun and The Age, Carey was gambling when a Ziploc bag of white powder fell onto a gaming table. Carey denied the substance was illegal, claiming it was a \"crushed-up anti-inflammatory\".[61][62] Carey was issued with a \"withdrawal of license\" notice, which means he cannot attend Crown properties for two years. It saw him ejected from the Crown hotel, where he was staying for the Fremantle\u2013Bulldogs elimination final. This also means that he will be unable to attend the 2022 Brownlow Medal count that will be held at Crown Palladium in Melbourne.[63]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Carey"}, {"id": 249, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/2492/49838927/original/anthony-pereira-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Anthony Pereira", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/anthony-pereira/49838927", "desc": "Anthony Pereira (born 9 April 1982 in Navelim, Goa) is an Indian football player.

He is considered to be one of the best forwards of the modern era, being named All-Australian, leading his club's goalkicking on eleven occasions and captaining the Sydney Swans to their 2005 AFL Grand Final victory. In July 2011, Hall created history by becoming the first player to kick 100 goals for three AFL teams.\n\nHall began his career at the St Kilda Football Club where he twice led the club's goalkicking in 1999 and 2001. He is best known for his career with the Sydney Swans. He was one of the Swans' best players during his time at the club, topping the club goalkicking from 2002 to 2008 and co-captaining the side from 2005 to 2007, including the club's drought breaking premiership in 2005. He also featured heavily in the AFL's promotion in Sydney, gaining a similarly high-profile to Tony Lockett[1] which saw him featured in a 2006 AFL and Swans joint promotion known as \"Barry Hall Hall\".\n\nThe former junior boxing champion's AFL career has been marred by a reputation for on-field aggression, which has earned him the label of football \"wild man\" and he became one of the most feared players on the field. Several controversial and highly publicised incidents (often called \"brain snaps\" by the media) and tribunal appearances have interrupted his career and contributed to a change of clubs.\n\nHall was born in Victoria and grew up in Broadford, where he played his junior football. His other interests were martial arts and boxing. At the age of 12 he moved to Melbourne to pursue a boxing career.[2] Training in a makeshift boxing gym in his father's garage, he won a state title in his early teenage years and had fought in 15 fights by the age of 15.\n\nHall also showed a talent for Australian football. After playing for the Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup and attracting the eye of talent scouts, he decided to focus on football.\n\nHall made his AFL debut for St Kilda in 1996. He helped fill the void of the record-breaking forward Tony Lockett, who had moved to the Swans the previous season. His most memorable performance for the Saints was his 3-goal burst during a five-minute period in the second quarter of the 1997 Grand Final, in which put his side in a strong position going into half-time, despite St Kilda going on to be defeated by Adelaide by 31 points at the MCG. He played for St Kilda until 2001, kicking 144 goals in 88 games and being the club's leading goalkicker in the 1999 and 2001 seasons. He kicked a career-best 8 goals in Round 16, 2001 against the Western Bulldogs. He left St Kilda at the end of 2001 in style, kicking a goal after the final siren of a Round 22 match against Hawthorn to win the match. One of the main reasons for leaving was the rise of Nick Riewoldt, Justin Koschitzke and the recruitment of Fraser Gehrig, as well as salary cap constraints.\n\nHall joined the Swans for the 2002 season and prospered under the coaching of Paul Roos. He led the club's goalscoring in every season up until 2009 and was named club Best and Fairest in 2004. He has said that he benefited from the move to Sydney, in particular the relative anonymity he enjoyed when first arriving, playing alongside Tony Lockett in Lockett's comeback-from-retirement season. Hall's form reached a high in 2004 when he was named in the All-Australian team. He then took his game to a whole new level from 2005, and not only bagged 80 goals for the season and a second placing for the Coleman Medal, but set up many more goals as well. He was selected in the All-Australian list in 2005 and 2006 and captained the Swans to their historic 2005 Grand Final premiership victory, their first since 1933. He led the Swans goalkicking in seasons 2005 to 2006, and in that two-year period he kicked two bags of seven against Essendon in their matches in Melbourne (a win in 2005 but a loss in 2006). He also led the club's goalkicking in seasons 2007 and 2008, but in those two seasons he struggled with suspension and injury. He has also kicked big bags of goals against notably weaker opponents such as Carlton.\n\nHall earned a reputation as a controversial player, with several appearances at the tribunal resulting in four suspensions for a total of 10 matches. He has given away almost twice as many free kicks as he has been given over his career, and in 2003 Swans coach Paul Roos questioned whether Hall was given all the free kicks he deserved. Hall struggled with injuries through the 2007 season and his form was generally considered to be somewhat down from his peak, although he played a number of outstanding games and still led the club's goalkicking with 44. In 2008, Hall began the season in good form but, following a punch thrown against West Coast Eagles player Brent Staker and a further incident where he aimed a punch at a Collingwood player, he missed a number of games and was suspended from the Swans' team on 8 July 2008.\n\nIn Round 19, 2008, against the Fremantle Football Club, he kicked the last goal in the final minute and won the game by four points. He kicked a bag of goals in that game and in Round 20, against the Geelong Cats, he kicked five goals and one behind. In spite of the Swans' 39-point defeat to the reigning premiers he was the leading goalkicker for the game. In 2008 Hall was awarded the Paul Roos Award for the best player in the finals. He finished the year as Sydney's leading goalkicker for the seventh consecutive year, equalling the club record of Len Mortimer.\n\nHall kicked his 600th career goal against the Western Bulldogs in Round 10, 2009, when he kicked six in that game. After a striking incident involving Adelaide's Ben Rutten in his 250th game, Hall was put under an immense amount of pressure from coach Paul Roos to leave the club. Hall called a press conference on 7 July 2009 to announce that he was no longer going to play for the Swans. He kicked four goals in his last game for the club.[3][4]\n\nIt was announced on 6 October 2009 that the Western Bulldogs had agreed to trade draft pick 47 for Hall with Sydney.[3] On his Bulldogs' debut, in the second round of the 2010 NAB Cup, he kicked six goals against Hawthorn. He then kicked four goals against Port Adelaide and had a part in the final and winning goal which gave the Bulldogs a place in the NAB Cup grand final against his first club, St Kilda. In the final he kicked seven goals, including five in the last quarter, to lead the Bulldogs to their first grand final success of any kind since 1970. He was awarded the Michael Tuck Medal for best on ground.[5] He made his home-and-away debut for the Bulldogs in Round 1 against Collingwood at Docklands Stadium, but his side were defeated by 36 points. Hall kicked three goals.\n\nHall's good form at the Bulldogs continued, with four and five goals in successive games helping him get back to his best form of his early years at the Sydney Swans. In 2010 Hall was tripped by Essendon defender and rival Dustin Fletcher in Round 10, costing Fletcher a one-match suspension. In Round 15 in 2010, he kicked six goals against Carlton and also suffered an ankle injury. He finished second on the 2010 Coleman Medal table with 73 goals in the home and away season, behind Richmond's Jack Riewoldt. He kicked his 700th goal against the Gold Coast Suns in Round 3, 2011 and in Round 17, 2011 against North Melbourne he became the first player to kick over 100 goals for three clubs when he kicked five goals.\n\nOn 19 July 2011, Hall announced his intention to retire at the end of the 2011 season. Despite captaining Sydney to their 2005 premiership, Hall stated that he wanted to be remembered as a Bulldogs player due to them giving him a last chance at playing AFL football in 2010. Coincidentally, this announcement came in the week leading up to the Bulldogs' clash against the Swans at the Sydney Cricket Ground; in that match, he kicked five goals as the Bulldogs lost by 39 points.[6][7]\n\nHall ended his AFL career with 40 goals in his last eight matches and 55 overall for the 2011 AFL season. In his final three games, he was coached by his 2005 Sydney premiership teammate Paul Williams, who had taken over from Rodney Eade (also his coach at the Swans in the first half of 2002) at the conclusion of round 21.[8] In total he kicked 746 career AFL goals, placing him 16th on the all-time goal-kicking list.\n\nWhilst playing in a reserves game for St Kilda against North Melbourne in Round 14 in 1997, Hall struck Sam McFarlane, a slightly built wingman, in the jaw, breaking it in three places. McFarlane spent the next three days in hospital getting the jaw wired back together and was sidelined for ten weeks. Although McFarlane returned for the final two games of the year, he never returned to play league football again.[9]\n\nIn the 1998 second semi-final St Kilda held the lead over Melbourne near the end of the second quarter. After being tackled by Steven Febey, Hall dropped his knees into Febey's head and after regaining his feet he slung Adem Yze to the ground. In frustration his outburst lead to an altercation with teammates Matthew Lappin and Shane Wakelin where Hall had to be restrained by his teammates and trainers. The incident resulted in a four-match suspension and Melbourne then took control of the match and won easily, ending St Kilda's 1998 season.\n\nIn July 2002, while playing for Sydney, Hall was suspended for five matches after being found guilty of clawing the face of Port Adelaide ruckman Matthew Primus during a Swans loss at the SCG. Hall had been charged on video evidence with making \"unreasonable and unnecessary contact to the face\". Hall acknowledged he had made contact with Primus's face, but denied he had tried to eye-gouge him. \"I made face contact which I regret, but it certainly looks worse than what it was\" said Hall.[10]\n\nAfter an incident involving a punch to the stomach of St Kilda's Matt Maguire in a 2005 preliminary final match,[11] Hall was reported for a level two striking and offered a one-week suspension for a guilty plea. This suspension would have meant missing the next week's grand final. Hall's representation successfully argued that the incident was 'in play' despite the ball being 50 metres away. As a result, the charge was reduced to a level one offence which reduced the penalty to a reprimand and he went on to captain the Swans to their first premiership in 72 years, defeating the West Coast Eagles in the grand final by four points.[12]\n\nIn an incident which shocked Sydney and West Coast fans alike, in Round 4, 2008, Hall was reported for striking West Coast Eagles defender Brent Staker.[13] Video footage from the incident indicated that contact was made with a punch to the jaw.[14] Staker took no further part in the game, remaining off the field for the duration of the game. Later in the same game, Hall broke his wrist on the metal railing behind a soft cardboard advertising board. After the game the Match Review Panel ranked the incident as intentional, severe impact and high contact, therefore the offence was directly referred to the AFL Tribunal. He was subsequently suspended for seven games, one of the most severe punishments in the modern era by the AFL Tribunal.[15] Video footage of the incident was shown on television as far abroad as Denmark and the United States on the ESPN network.[16]\n\nHall was handed a one-match suspension for an attempted strike on Collingwood's Shane Wakelin, his former St Kilda teammate, in Round 14, 2008.[17][18] Sydney later announced the team would not play Hall indefinitely.[19][20] Sydney co-captain Brett Kirk later claimed that Hall's habit of hitting opposition players off the ball is a \"bad habit\".[21]\n\nOn 22 May 2010 Hall was again the centre of attention when he was pushed over by North Melbourne defender Scott Thompson while tying his shoelace, triggering an ugly altercation between Hall and several other North Melbourne players.[22] Hall reacted to the taunts by putting Thompson in a headlock and was subsequently reported for both wrestling and rough conduct. He was later found guilty of wrestling and fined, but not guilty of rough conduct.[23]\n\nTeam\n\nIndividual\n\nHall has been the centrepiece of advertising campaigns, including the \"Barry Hall Hall\" and \"Excitement Machine Machine\" 2006 television and internet campaign in Sydney by George Patterson Y&R for the Australian Football League which was a finalist at the Australian Interactive Media Industry Association[25] and Melbourne Advertising & Design Club[26] awards and also the \"Barry Hall vs Broadford\" 2007 advertisement by JWT Melbourne for Ford Australia pitting Barry Hall against his junior club (with cameos from Hall's nephew and aunt).[27]\n\nIn 2008 Hall appeared in a series of \"Barry Hall Hall\" ads; however, these were pulled from the air following the Brent Staker incident.\n\nHall's personal life has hit the media tabloids on several occasions, with his much publicised relationships with Kylie Stray and bikini model Tahli Greenwood.[28]\n\nBarry Hall married Sophie Raadschelder after dating for about a year in November 2011.[29] They separated in early 2015.[30]\n\nHall's other interests include gardening and collecting fast cars, including vintage car and drag racing cars.[31]\n\nIn 2013, he joined Fox Footy as a boundary rider.\n\nIn 2015, Hall appeared in the Australian version of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. Another contestant on that show was Lauren Brant with whom he developed a relationship. The couple have three boys.[32] He married Brant in February 2021.[33]\n\nIn 2018, Hall was immediately dismissed from radio station Triple M after making on-air remarks which were deemed unacceptable and inappropriate by station management.[34]\n\nHall is currently featuring on the third season of the Seven Network's reality quasi-military training television programme SAS Australia: Who Dares Wins, which premiered on 21 February 2022.[35][36]\n\nIn the middle of 2019, it was announced that Hall would make his professional boxing debut with the opponent being former rugby league footballer; Paul Gallen.  In the lead up to the fight, Hall said of Gallen \u201cI know it\u2019s been painted as a code war, but even the support I\u2019ve been getting off rugby league people has been overwhelming, He\u2019s not a very liked human being \u2026 so I\u2019ve got a lot of support\".[37]\n\nIn June 2021 Hall confirmed he will undertake another two fights. Hall squared off against Sonny Bill Williams in his second professional fight on March 23, 2022, in which the referee stopped the fight after Hall was dropped three times by Bill Williams in the first round, and Williams won by TKO.[38]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Hall"}, {"id": 251, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/47/935570/original/emanuel-de-porras-football-players-soccer-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&bg=fff&h=300&w=300", "name": "Emanuel De Porras", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/emanuel-de-porras/935570", "desc": "Emanuel De Porras, also known as Cachi de Porras (October 16, 1981) is an Argentine football player who plays for Colombian Categor\u00eda Primera B side Atletico Bucaramanga as a striker.\nHe has played for Benevento Calcio in Serie C2, as well as several Indonesian and Argentine sides, including Ferro Carril Oeste, Hurac\u00e1n, Persija Jakarta and Jakarta FC.", "full_desc": "Emanuel Mat\u00edas \"Cachi\" de Porras (born October 16, 1981) is a former Argentine footballer who played as a forward.\n\nDe Porras also played for Benevento in Italy and clubs in his native Argentina, such as Ferro Carril Oeste, Hurac\u00e1n, Flandria and Acassuso, as well as in Indonesia for PSIS Semarang and Persija Jakarta, Uruguay for Durazno, Malaysia for Negeri Sembilan and Colombia for Atl\u00e9tico Bucaramanga.\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_De_Porras"}, {"id": 252, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Gurpreet Singh Sandhu", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/gurpreet-singh-sadhu/62257797", "desc": "Gurpreet Singh Sandhu (born 3 February 1992) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for the Indian club Bengaluru.

Consequently, in May 2006 he was offered a new contract by AZ that would keep him until 2010.[14]\n\nIn the opening game of the 2006\u201307 season, de Zeeuw started the season well when he set up a goal for Joris Mathijsen, in an 8\u20131 win against NAC Breda.[15] In a follow\u2013up match against Vitesse, de Zeeuw scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20131 win.[16] Since the start of the 2006\u201307 season, he continued to establish himself in the first team, playing in the midfield position.[17] De Zeeuw scored his second goal of the season, in a 10\u20130 win against VV Bennekom in the second round of the KNVB Cup.[18] He then scored two goals in two matches between 22 October 2006 and 26 October 2006 against PSV Eindhoven and Willem II.[19] A week later on 2 November 2006, de Zeeuw scored his first European goal of his career, in a 5\u20132 win against Grasshoppers.[20] He then scored three goals in three matches between 8 November 2006 and 18 November 2006 against SV Meerssen, Heracles Almelo and Feyenoord.[21] On 14 February 2007, de Zeeuw scored his ninth goal of the season, in a 3\u20133 draw against Fenerbah\u00e7e in the first leg of UEFA Cup Round of 32.[22] During a 1\u20131 draw against AFC Ajax on 25 February 2007, he found himself colliding with Maarten Stekelenburg, leading to teammate Maarten Martens scoring an equalising goal, which led to criticism from Netherlands media.[23] De Zeeuw helped the club beat NAC Breda to reach the KNVB Cup Final on 19 April 2007.[24] In the final against Ajax, he started in the match and played 102 minutes before being substituted following a 1\u20131 draw, as AZ Alkmaar went on to lose on penalties.[25] De Zeeuw was featured in both legs in the play-offs for the European place against Ajax once again but the club lost 4\u20132 on aggregate.[26] Despite being sidelined the total of three matches throughout the 2006\u201307 season, he went on to make 53 appearances and scoring nine times in all competitions.[27] Following this, de Zeeuw signed a contract extension with AZ, keeping him until 2011.[28]\n\nAt the start of the 2007\u201308 season, de Zeeuw scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20130 win against Excelsior on 31 August 2007.[29] His second goal of the season came on 23 September 2007, in a 3\u20132 loss against Ajax.[30] Two weeks later on 7 October 2007, he scored his third goal of the season, in a 2\u20132 draw against FC Groningen.[31] After missing two matches due to injury, de Zeeuw scored on his return, as well as, setting up one of the goals for AZ Alkmaar, in a 4\u20130 win against NEC Nijmegen on 3 November 2007.[32] He then scored two goals in two matches between 5 December 2007 and 9 December 2007 against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg and FC Utrecht.[33] In a match against Ajax on 13 January 2008, de Zeeuw received a straight red card for handball after he \"had defused a header with his hand on the goal line\", in a 6\u20131 loss.[34] After the match, de Zeeuw's red card was overturned by KNVB because the club argued that he \"only hit a header from Klaas Jan Huntelaar behind the goal line with his hand\".[35] Having regained his first team place since the start of the 2007\u201308 season, playing in the midfield position, manager Van Gaal thought that the role of de Zeeuw in the squad had to change; he had to start carrying the team more.[36] However, de Zeeuw later criticised manager Van Gaal in an interview after there was a heated and emotional discussion between Van Gaal and the AZ players group.[37] Throughout the 2007\u201308 season, AZ performed below all expectations: before the start of the competition the team was seen as one of the challengers for the title, but halfway through the season all hope for winning the title was gone.[38] De Zeeuw described the season as \"one giant disappointment\".[39] AZ finished the season in a disappointing 11th position in the league.[40] Despite being sidelined on three occasions later in the 2007\u201308 season, he went on to make 37 appearances and scoring seven times in all competitions.[41]\n\nAfter UEFA Euro 2008, de Zeeuw was linked with a move to AFC Ajax, his childhood dream club, where former Netherlands manager Marco van Basten had taken over, but a move failed to materialise.[42] Partly because of his public soliciting for a transfer he saw himself out of the starting line-up at the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season in the opening match against NAC Breda.[43] De Zeeuw was almost transferred to Hamburger SV on the last day of the transfer period after an accord on the transfer fee was reached between the two clubs but the German club was too late to register the player with the German Football Association, so a move again failed to materialise.[44] He then made his first start of the season in the third league match of the season, a 1\u20130 victory over PSV Eindhoven on 20 September 2008.[45] In a follow\u2013up match against Willem II, de Zeeuw scored his first goal of the season, in a 5\u20133 win.[46] He then contributed for AZ Alkmaar when he set up three goals in the next two matches, including a brace against Sparta Rotterdam.[47] Despite his problems at the beginning of the season, de Zeeuw soon fought himself back into the starting line-up, playing in the midfield position.[48] In his 100th appearance for the club, he then scored his second goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win against Ajax on 23 November 2008.[49] After missing one match due to picking yellow cards, de Zeeuw returned to the starting line\u2013up against Feyenoord on 13 December 2008 and helped AZ Alkmaar win 1\u20130.[50] In a follow\u2013up match against FC Utrecht, he scored his third goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win.[51] During the winter break, La Liga side Valencia and HSV, again, wanted to sign de Zeeuw, but the club stated that they would not allow the player to leave halfway throughout the season.[52] AZ would not lose a single match in the rest of the first half of the competition, and helped the club win the league for the first time since 1981 after title contender AFC Ajax lost 6\u20132 to PSV Eindhoven on 18 April 2009.[53] At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he went on to make 34 appearances and scoring three times in all competitions.[54] For his performance, de Zeeuw was named Voetbal International's Team of the Season.[55]\n\nIn the spring of 2009, AZ offered de Zeeuw a contract extension again, this time until 2011. This time, however, the player rejected the proposal.[56] The success brought more attention from international clubs including HSV once again.[57] In July 2009 Ajax officially announced that they were interested in signing the player. De Zeeuw himself stated that he was interested in moving to the Amsterdam club where former HSV manager Martin Jol had taken over from Van Basten.[58] AZ initially stated that they did not wish to sell the player to a club they saw as a direct competitor, but after several weeks showed a willingness to cooperate on the transfer.[59] On 24 July 2009, the definite transfer from AZ to Ajax was announced for a reported \u20ac6 million.[60] The player signed a contract for 4 seasons, until 2013.[61]\n\nDe Zeeuw was presented to the Ajax fans ahead of a match between Ajax and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid during the Amsterdam Tournament and was given a number forty shirt.[62] He later stated his choice to join boyhood club because of UEFA Champions League and that manager Martin Jol was a huge factor for him to join.[63]\n\nDe Zeeuw made his debut for Ajax, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20130 win against FC Groningen in the opening game of the season.[64] After the match, manager Jol praised his performance, calling it \"excellent\".[65] Since joining the club, he quickly establish himself in the first team, playing in the defensive midfield position.[66] Despite suffering a foot injury, de Zeeuw started in the match in the play\u2013off round of the UEFA Europa League against Slovan Bratislava and played a role for Ajax when he set up twice in the first leg in a 5\u20130 win, as the club went on to win 7\u20131 on aggregate.[67] De Zeeuw followed up by contributing three assists in two matches, with once against Heracles Almelo and twice against NAC Breda.[68] Two weeks later on 27 September 2009, he scored his first Eredivisie goal for Ajax in a 3\u20130 victory over ADO Den Haag at the Amsterdam ArenA.[69] During a 1\u20131 draw against Anderlecht on 2 October 2009, de Zeeuw was involved in an incident with Jelle Van Damme after he tackled Van Damme, provoking him by pushing him that was caught by the referee and was given a red card.[70] After the match, Van Damme felt that de Zeeuw should have been sent\u2013off for the tackle on him.[71] But no action was taken against him, as Van Damme was given a two match suspension.[72] In a build up to a match against his former club AZ Alkmaar on 25 October 2009, he praised manager Jol and claimed his management was better than Van Gaal, claiming that he \"can build a team himself, puts it tactically well, makes players better individually\".[73] On the day of the match against his former club AZ Alkmaar, de Zeeuw started in the match and made an assist for Gregory van der Wiel, as the club won 4\u20132.[74] However, the match was overshadowed for de Zeeuw, as he was booed and jeered by AZ Alkmaar fans, who at one point called him \"cancer jew\", so referee Bas Nijhuis stopped the match for time being.[75] This led to AZ Alkmaar's management to apologise to de Zeeuw for the chant, though no actions against his former club was taken by the KNVB.[76] On 1 November 2009, he scored a brace in the \"klassieker\" against arch-rivals Feyenoord in a 5\u20131 thrashing of the Rotterdam team.[77] This was followed up by scoring his first goal in European football, in a 2\u20130 win against Dinamo Zagreb.[78] Three weeks later on 22 November 2009, he scored another brace, in a 5\u20131 demolition of SC Heerenveen, taking his tally to six goals in the first 21 matches of the 2009\u201310 season.[79] A month later on 23 December 2009, de Zeeuw scored his seventh goal of the season, as well as, providing a hat\u2013trick assists, in a 14\u20131 win against WHC Wezep in the last 16 of the KNVB Cup.[80] After missing one match due to a yellow card, he scored his return from suspension, as well as, providing a double assists, in a 3\u20131 win against NEC Nijmegen on 27 January 2010.[81] A week later on 7 February 2010, de Zeeuw scored his ninth goal of the season, in a 3\u20130 win against FC Twente.[82] Two weeks later against Vitesse on 21 February 2010, he provided two assists in the last two matches for Ajax, in a 4\u20130 win.[83] After missing another one match suspension due to suspension, de Zeeuw scored on his return from suspension, in a 6\u20130 win against Go Ahead Eagles on 25 March 2010 to help the club reach the final of the KNVB Cup.[84] In the last game of the season against NEC Nijmegen, he scored his eleventh goal of the season, as Ajax won 4\u20131 to finish second place after finishing behind FC Twente, who won the league title.[85] In the final of KNVB Cup, de Zeeuw played in both legs and in the second leg, he set up a goal for Siem de Jong, as the club beat Feyernood 6\u20131 on aggregate to win the tournament.[86] Throughout the 2009\u201310 season, he suffered minor setbacks that saw him miss matches.[87] Despite this, de Zeeuw finished his season with a positive one, as he scored eleven goals in forty-seven appearances in all competitions.[88]\n\nAhead of the 2010\u201311 season, de Zeeuw switched number shirt from 40 to 20.[89] He also stated his prediction that Ajax could be title contenders.[90] De Zeeuw helped the club reach the Group-Stage of the UEFA Champions League after beating PAOK Salonika and Dynamo Kiev.[91] De Zeeuw played a role in the league when he set up three times in the first four league matches of the season for Ajax.[92] In a match against Real Madrid on 15 September 2010, de Zeeuw played 68 minutes before being substituted, in which he was unhappy with Jol's decision to have him substituted.[93] As a result, de Zeeuw was dropped to the substitute bench for the match against the club's rival, Feyenoord on 19 September 2010.[94] He scored his first UEFA Champions League goal, as Ajax beat Auxerre 2\u20131 on 19 October 2010.[95] Despite this, de Zeeuw continued to feature in and out of the first team under the management of Martin Jol and this lasted until Jol was sacked and replaced by Frank de Boer.[96] In de Boer's first game, he scored his second UEFA Champions League goal, in a 2\u20130 win over Milan on 8 December 2010, as the club finished third place in the group stage, resulting in them playing in the UEFA Europa League.[97] Under de Boer, de Zeeuw's playing style changed after de Boer made changes to the club's style of play.[98] On the last day of the January transfer window, he was linked with a move to the Turkish team Fenerbah\u00e7e who even made a bid for him, which was rejected by Ajax.[99] De Zeeuw then scored his third goal of the season, in a 5\u20131 win against RKC Waalwijk in the semi\u2013finals of the KNVB Cup.[100] Three days later on 6 March 2011 against his former club, he scored his fourth goal of the season and was named man of the match after beating AZ Alkmaar 4\u20130.[101] In the final of the KNVB Cup against Twente, de Zeeuw scored the opener after just 19 minutes, but unfortunately, Ajax would go on to lose 3\u20132 to Twente.[102] Seven days later on 15 May 2011, Ajax and Twente decided the Eredivisie title in the last league match of the season, and de Zeeuw started the whole hame, as the club won 3\u20131 to win the league title.[103] Throughout the 2010\u201311 season, he suffered minor injuries but didn'r affect his first team place.[104] Despite this, de Zeeuw went on to make 47 appearances and scoring five times in all competitions.\n\nAt the end of the 2010\u201311 season, de Zeeuw was linked with a move to Spartak Moscow.[105] Manager de Boer was willing to sell him at the right price.[106] On 29 June 2011, it was reported by De Telegraaf Ajax agreed to sell de Zeeuw to Spartak Moscow.[107]\n\nThe transfer move was officially confirmed on 6 July 2011 when de Zeeuw had transferred to the Russian club for an estimated \u20ac7 million.[108] As a result of the move to Spartak Moscow, his first club, Go Ahead Eagles, received 5% transfer move.[109] Upon joining Spartak Moscow, de Zeeuw would play in the same position, just like he did at Ajax, as manager Valeri Karpin suggested.[110] In addition, de Zeeuw was given a number sixteen shirt.[111]\n\nAfter being absent for two games at the start of the season, de Zeeuw made his debut for the club in a 4\u20132 win over Terek Grozny on 7 August 2011.[112] After a slow start, he scored his first goal for Spartak Moscow in a 3\u20130 win over Krylia Sovetov Samara on 18 September 2011.[113] In a follow\u2013up match Krasnodar on 25 September 2011, de Zeeuw scored his second goal for the club, in a 4\u20132 win but he suffered an injury and was substituted as a result.[114] After the match, manager Karpin suggested that de Zeeuw suffered a concussion as the result of his injury.[115] But he made a quick recovery and was featured in a match against Zenit Saint Petersburg on 2 October 2011 and set up one of Spartak Moscow's goals, in a 2\u20132 draw.[116] However, during a 4\u20130 win against Tom Tomsk on 23 October 2011, de Zeeuw sustained a knee injury and had to be substituted in the 62nd minute.[117] As a result, he would miss the remaining two games before taking a long break until March.[118] On 19 March 2012, de Zeeuw made his return to the first team from injury, starting a match and playing 73 minutes before being substituted, in a 2\u20131 loss against CSKA Moscow.[119] However, his return was short\u2013lived when he suffered an injury and never played for the rest of the 2011\u201312 season.[120] At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, de Zeeuw went on to make sixteen appearances and scoring two times in all competitions. However, he was criticised by the club's supporters.[121] In response to criticism, de Zeeuw said he doesn't get on the first team because of injuries, and was often played in occasional games.[122]\n\nAt the start of the 2012\u201313 season, de Zeeuw started in a number of matches for Spartak Moscow, playing in the defensive midfield position.[123] However, he received a second bookable offense in the play-off of the Champions League, as the club beat Fenerbah\u00e7e 3\u20132 on aggregate to reach the group-stage.[124] After the match, de Zeeuw said he expressed his dissatisfaction for receiving a second bookable offense.[125] De Zeeuw then scored his first goal of the season, in a 2\u20131 win against Salyut Belgorod in the round of 32 of Russian Cup on 26 September 2012.[126] A week later on 2 October 2012 against Celtic, he set up a goal for Emmanuel Emenike, who went on to score twice, in a 3\u20132 loss.[127] However, de Zeeuw was unable to earn his first place, as he could not really prevail and often sat on the bench in his second season at Spartak Moscow.[128] As a result, de Zeeuw was expecting to leave the club in the January transfer window.[129] By the time he was loaned out, he went on to make seventeen appearances and scoring once in all competitions.\n\nAfter joining Anderlecht on loan, de Zeeuw was described as the \"worst transfer signing\" by Manager Karpin, who signed him from Ajax.[130] He expressed relief at leaving Spartak Moscow.[131] At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, de Zeeuw was considered by the club to be in the first team next season, but de Zeeuw made it clear that he refused to return to the club.[132] At the end of the 2013\u201314 season, de Zeeuw was released by the club when his contract expired.[133]\n\nOn 22 January 2013, de Zeeuw joined Belgian Pro League club Anderlecht on loan for the remainder of the season.[134] Upon joining the club, he was given a number six shirt.[135]\n\nDe Zeeuw made his debut for Anderlecht on 15 February 2013, coming on as a 75th-minute substitute, in a 2\u20130 victory over Charleroi.[136] In a follow\u2013up match against Club Brugge, he set up a goal for Samuel Armenteros to score an equalising goal, in a 2\u20132 draw.[137] Following this, de Zeeuw was involved in a number of matches in the first team, playing in the midfield position.[138] On 19 May 2013, he scored his first goal for the club, in a 4\u20132 win over Lokeren.[139] His goal against Genk in the previous match eventually awarded it as an own goal to Khaleem Hyland.[140] His contributions at the club saw Anderlect win the league after a 1\u20131 draw against Zulte-Waregem.[141] At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, de Zeeuw went on to make twelve appearances and scoring once in all competitions. With no option to sign on a permanent basis, he returned to his parent club.[142]\n\nHaving wanted to stay at Anderlecht for another season, it was announced on 5 July 2013 that de Zeeuw was loaned again by the club for the second time, which would keep him until the end of the 2013\u201314 season.[143] His first game after signing for Anderlecht on loan for the second time came on 21 July 2013 against Genk and started the whole game, in a 1\u20130 win.[144] Since making his debut for the club, he found himself in and out of the first team.[145][146] De Zeeuw then scored his first goal for Anderlecht in his second loan spell against Zulte-Waregem on 1 September 2013 and the club went on to lose 4\u20133.[147] Three weeks later on 25 September 2013, he scored his second goal for Anderlecht in the round six of the Belgian Cup, in a 7\u20130 win over Eupen.[148] On 5 November 2013, he scored his third goal of the season, in the Champions League Group Stage, in a 1\u20131 draw against Paris Saint Germain.[149] After the match, de Zeeuw said scoring against PSG made it his day, as he relished it.[150] On 30 November 2013, de Zeeuw was later criticised by Manager John van den Brom for having a bad attitude.[151] The pair previously clashed after he criticised van den Brom's tactics following a 2\u20130 loss against Benfica in a UEFA Champions League match on 17 September 2013.[152] But they quickly made amends after meeting each other.[153] Despite reports that de Zeeuw could leave the club in the January transfer window, he ended up staying at Anderlecht for the rest of the 2013\u201314 season.[154] Following this, de Zeeuw suffered a concussion while training and never played for the club again.[155] Despite this, his contributions to Anderlecht later saw them win the league once again.[156] At the end of the 2013\u201314 season, he went on to make eighteen appearances and scoring three times in all competitions. Following this, de Zeeuw left Anderlecht and returned to his parent club.[157]\n\nAfter leaving Spartak Moscow, de Zeeuw was linked with a move to New York Cosmos and various Dutch clubs, including his former club, Go Ahead Eagles and NAC Breda.[158] After spending six months as a free agent, he made himself publicity available after posting it on LinkedIn.[159] On 7 February 2015, de Zeeuw signed an amateur deal with Dutch Eredivisie team NAC Breda until the end of the season.[160] Because of Dutch football regulations, de Zeeuw's amateur deal was turned into a professional deal on 10 February 2015.[161]\n\nHe made his debut for the club against ADO Den Haag on 14 February 2015 and scored twice, as NAC Breda lost 3\u20132.[162] In a follow\u2013up match against SC Cambuur, de Zeeuw set up one a goal for Adnane Tighadouini, who went on to score twice, in a 2\u20131 win.[163] Since joining NAC Breda, he quickly established himself in the first team, playing in the midfield position.[164] In the league's play-off spot, de Zeeuw played all four matches, as he failed to help the club avoid relegation after losing to Roda JC through away goal.[165] At the end of the 2014\u201315 season, de Zeeuw went on to make sixteen appearances and scoring two times in all competitrions. Following this, he was released by NAC Breda.[166]\n\nDe Zeeuw spent a year being a free agent before announcing his retirement from professional football in October 2016.[167]\n\nThough de Zeeuw was born in Apeldoorn, Netherlands, he was eligible to represent the Netherlands Antilles before the team became defunct in 2010.\n\nIn May 2005, de Zeeuw was called up to the Netherlands U21 squad for the first time.[168] He made his debut for the U21 Oranje side, coming on as a second half substitute, in a 2\u20130 win against Romania U21 on 3 June 2005.[169] De Zeeuw was called up to the Netherlands U21 squad for the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Portugal.[170] Three days later on 17 May 2006, he scored his first goal for the U21 Oranje side, in a 2\u20132 draw against Germany U21.[171] Besides being an unused substitute in a 2\u20131 loss against Ukraine U21 in the group match, de Zeeuw played in every match on the tournament.[172] Jong Oranje started and finished their campaign against Ukraine U21, going out on a high with a 3\u20130 win in the final, after surprisingly losing their opening game to the Ukrainian team.[173] Following the tournament, manager Foppe de Haan praised both de Zeeuw and Isma\u00efl Aissati's performances.[174] Following this, he went in to make ten appearances and scoring once for the Netherlands U21 side.[175]\n\nDe Zeeuw played so well for AZ that he was able to make his debut for the Netherlands national football team under then-manager Marco van Basten in August 2006.[176] However, de Zeeuw spent the next seven months, appearing as an unused substitute.[177] Impressive performances for AZ led to his international debut for the Dutch national team in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Slovenia on 28 March 2007, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 win.[178]\n\nDe Zeeuw usually played as a defensive midfielder and in the national team, he had to compete with the likes of Mark van Bommel, Orlando Engelaar, and Nigel de Jong in that position.[179] De Zeeuw made his first start for Netherlands, starting a match and played 58 minutes before being substituted, in a friendly against South Korea on 2 June 2007.[180] In a match against Bulgaria on 8 September 2007, he started the whole game and was a key player throughout the match, as Oranje won 2\u20130.[181] De Zeeuw started in the remaining UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying matches, as he helped Netherlands qualify for the UEFA Euro 2008.[182] In March 2008, de Zeeuw said in an interview with Algemeen Dagblad that he hoped to make a good impression during UEFA Euro 2008 to earn a transfer to another club.[183] For the first six months of 2008, de Zeeuw continued to feature regularly for the national side, playing in the midfield position.[184] Two months later, he was included in the Oranje's provisional squad.[185] De Zeeuw made the 23 men squad ahead of the tournament despite suffering setback to his injury.[186] However, his appearance was limited to a single appearance in the group stage against Romania.[187]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the UEFA Euro 2008, de Zeeuw received another call\u2013up from the Netherlands squad on 6 August 2008.[188] He made his first appearance of the national side in two months against Russia on 20 August 2008, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20131

64th-minute substitute and set up a goal for Wesley Sneijder to score the second goal of the game, in a 3\u20130 win.[191] With Oranje qualifying for the FIFA World Cup, de Zeeuw said he determined to make it to the Netherlands squad.[192] In May 2010, de Zeeuw was included in the preliminary squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[193] On 27 May 2010, Netherlands manager Bert van Marwijk announced that the player would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the competition.[194] Prior to the start of the tournament, he made his 25th appearance for Oranje, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute, in a 6\u20131 win against Hungary on 5 June 2010.[195] De Zeeuw came on as a substitute for their first match in the competition, a 2\u20130 victory over Denmark on 14 June 2010.[196] He then appeared on the substitute bench for the next four matches, as Oranje reached the quarter\u2013final.[197] De Zeeuw was in the starting line-up for the semi-final match against Uruguay and provided an assist for Giovanni van Bronckhorst to score the opening goal of the game, in a 3\u20132 win.[198] However, during the match, the player had to be replaced by Rafael van der Vaart at half time after an incident where he was kicked in the face by Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres and was taken to the hospital as a result.[199] Neuropsychology concludes that de Zeeuw could have suffered multiple symptoms.[200] But he was given an all clear by doctors and had to wear braces for six weeks.[201] Nevertheless, de Zeeuw appeared as an unused substitute in the FIFA World Cup Final against Spain, as Netherlands lost 1\u20130, finishing the tournament as runners\u2013up.[202]\n\nSince the World Cup, de Zeeuw was called up by Netherlands squad for the match against San Marino, but did not play.[203] However, he struggled to earn a call up by the national team and cited lack of first opportunities at Spartak Moscow, as well as injuries, as some of the reasons for his absence and quietly retired from international football.[204]\n\nDe Zeeuw revealed that when he was five years old, his parents divorced and he moved with his father to Apeldoorn.[205] De Zeeuw spoke about his relationship with his mother, saying: \"My mother was only 16 years old when she got me, my father a few years older. That is why it was a logical choice that I went to live with him. In the early years I saw my mother sometimes, then only once. I was fifteen. I have never seen or spoken to her since.\"[205] In April 2014, de Zeeuw became a father when his girlfriend gave birth to a girl, Roqi.[206][3] In April 2018, he became a second time father when his girlfriend (now wife) gave birth to a baby boy.[207]\n\nIn January 2011, de Zeeuw tweeted that his house was robbed after claiming that the thieves took his jewellery, laptop and also his Fiat 500 car.[208] In July 2014, he tweeted once again that his girlfriend's car was stolen while on vacation.[209]\n\nUpon joining Spartak Moscow, de Zeeuw started learning Russian.[210] He also speaks Dutch and English.[211] Esquire named de Zeeuw as the most fashionable footballer and in the same interview, he later stated travelling as his greatest passion.[212] De Zeeuw says his idol was Roberto Baggio while growing up.[213]\n\nDemy de Zeeuw created his own brand called Balr with a few different Dutch footballers called Eljero Elia and Gregory van der Wiel.[166][214] De Zeeuw also owns a few big instagram accounts like: @balr, @433, @hotels and @wannahaves.[215] He later revealed that his step mother was an influence for him to become a businessman.[205]\n\nAZ[218]\n\nAjax[218]\n\nAnderlecht[218]\n\nNetherlands[218]\n", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demy_de_Zeeuw"}, {"id": 254, "icon": "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/app/noImage.svg?fit=crop&q=60&dpr=4&w=300", "name": "Aleksei Borisovich Yeryomenko", "url": "https://www.ranker.com/review/aleksei-borisovich-yeryomenko/30953075", "desc": "Aleksei Borisovich Yeryomenko (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0415\u0440\u0451\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e; born 17 January 1964), also known as Alexei Eremenko Sr. is a Russian professional football manager and a former player who also holds Finnish citizenship.
